<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Sets Out Changes To Payment Safeguarding Rules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Consumers will be better protected when they use payment firms, with the introduction of new rules to protect their money from May 2026. These changes will improve safeguarding practices among payment firms.</p>
<p>Safeguarding means that customer money must be kept separate from the firm&rsquo;s own money so that it is available to be returned if the firm fails.</p>
<p>Following constructive engagement with industry, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-12-changes-safeguarding-regime-payments-and-e-money-firms" title="PS25/12: Changes to the safeguarding regime for payments and e-money firms">FCA has confirmed</a>&nbsp;that the new rules will kick in after 9 months, giving industry time to prepare. It has also made changes to ensure that rules are proportionate for smaller firms, such as by removing the requirement for audits if a firm holds less than &pound;100,000 in customer funds.</p>
<p>These rules mean that consumers are better protected, and if a payment or e-money firm fails they are more likely to get a full refund and with fewer delays.</p>
<p>The new rules require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual audits by qualified auditors.</li>
<li>Monthly reporting for payment firms.</li>
<li>Firms to conduct daily checks to make sure the right amount of money is being safeguarded to protect customers.</li>
<li>Better planning if firms fail so customers receive their money back sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules will address issues the regulator has found in previous failures of payment firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payment firms that became insolvent between Q1 2018 and Q2 2023 had average shortfalls of 65% of their customers&rsquo; funds.</p>
<p>Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets, FCA, said: 'People rely on payment firms to help manage their financial lives. But too often, when those firms fail, their customers are left out of pocket.</p>
<p>'Most of those who responded to our consultation agreed we need to raise standards to protect people&rsquo;s money and build trust, but any changes needed to be proportionate, especially for smaller firms.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;ll be watching closely to see if firms seize the opportunity and make effective improvements that their customers rightly deserve &ndash; this will help us to determine whether any further tightening of rules is necessary.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>

<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-12-changes-safeguarding-regime-payments-and-e-money-firms" title="PS25/12: Changes to the safeguarding regime for payments and e-money firms">PS25/12: Changes to the safeguarding regime for payments and e-money firms.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fca-approach-payment-services-electronic-money-2017-may-2026-draft.pdf" title="Payment Services and Electronic Money - Our Approach, May 2026 draft version">Intended amendments to Payment Services and Electronic Money - Our Approach, May 2026 draft version</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA will be actively supporting industry through the implementation period to help them make changes, with webinars, events and our day-to-day supervisory work.</li>
<li>Funds held by payment and e-money firms are not directly protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Instead, firms must safeguard funds which can mean customers lose money or experience delays to funds being returned if the firm fails.</li>
<li>The rules will come into effect on 7 May 2026.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>In a pioneering step toward the convergence of real estate, blockchain, and regulated digital finance, Archax, Verseprop, Spitfire Group, Daizun and the XDC Network have collectively announced the successful execution of a tokenised commercial real estate finance transaction. The companies believe this marks a significant milestone in the evolution of institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span>This strategic collaboration brings together several industry leaders:</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Archax, the first FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, broker, and custodian, brings deep expertise in compliant tokenised asset infrastructure and regulated capital markets access.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Verseprop, a proptech innovator transforming real estate finance and investment through tokenisation, bridges traditional real estate finance markets with next-generation digital ownership models.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Spitfire Group has been active in the collateralised lending space for many years, delivering strong, risk-adjusted returns across a range of secured finance strategies. With a focus on institutional standards and robust underwriting, Spitfire is proud to participate in this pioneering initiative, helping to bring the benefits of real estate-backed lending to a broader audience through the power of tokenisation.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Daizun Investments is a principal lender based in London and the South Coast, specialising in bridging and development finance for the UK property sector. They offer fast, flexible funding solutions for property investors, developers, asset managers, and SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>XDC Network is an enterprise-grade, open-source blockchain protocol. An EVM-compatible chain with smart contract capabilities, it is uniquely suited to revolutionise, decentralise, and liquify the trade finance industry through the tokenization of real-world assets and financial instruments.</span></p>
<p><span>This transaction showcases how real-world assets &ndash; specifically commercial real estate &ndash; can be digitally financed and traded using blockchain technology, unlocking new efficiencies and liquidity pathways. By combining regulatory clarity, asset-backed token issuance, and decentralised settlement layers, the initiative demonstrates the maturity and readiness of tokenised finance to scale in institutional markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Nick Donovan, CRO of Archax, commented: &ldquo;This project showcases how regulated digital asset infrastructure can be applied to real-world finance. We are pleased to support this transaction using our FCA-regulated framework and continue to lead the way in tokenised markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Joel Coren, CEO of Verseprop, added: "Our mission has always been to redefine the real estate sector, and we are doing that with institutional-grade clients and transformative projects. By tokenising commercial real estate alongside trusted partners like Archax, Spitfire Group, Daizun and XDC, we are demonstrating that real estate finance can be faster, more efficient, and significantly more cost-effective than traditional models. This is the future of real estate and the future of finance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>James Edwards, Co-Founder at Daizun Investments, added:&nbsp;&ldquo;Working with Verseprop has given us direct insight into the transformative potential of tokenised real estate finance - seamless, agile, and built for the future of the sector. This landmark transaction highlights how leading institutional partners - including Archax, Spitfire, Verseprop and XDC - are collectively reshaping the landscape of on-chain real estate funding.&nbsp;Here at Daizun, we are&nbsp;pleased to contribute to a transaction that not only aligns with our financing goals but also sets a new standard for innovation across the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kenneth Cowan, Director at XDC, said: &ldquo;The XDC Network is purpose-built for real-world asset tokenisation, and this transaction illustrates the practical utility of blockchain in institutional finance. We&rsquo;re excited to support scalable, secure tokenised finance initiatives like this one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>This landmark deal sets a precedent for how blockchain, regulatory clarity, and asset innovation can combine to deliver greater transparency, efficiency, and global access to high-value asset classes, like commercial real estate.</span></p>

<title>OTP Bank Has Joined CLSSettlement As A Settlement Member</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/otp-bank-has-joined-clssettlement-as-a-settlement-member-202587/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions across the global FX ecosystem, announced today that OTP Bank Plc. (OTP Bank), has joined CLSSettlement as a settlement member. The Hungarian credit institution is the second new settlement member to join this year, bringing the total number of settlement members to 75.</p>
<p>OTP Bank is one of the largest commercial banks in Hungary. It is part of OTP Group, a recognized leading banking group in the Central and Eastern European region that is experiencing significant growth and expansion.</p>
<p>OTP Bank joining CLSSettlement demonstrates the growing appetite among financial institutions to adopt payment-versus-payment (PvP) settlement solutions to mitigate FX settlement risk, improve operational efficiency and enhance liquidity. CLSSettlement is recognized as the global standard in FX settlement risk mitigation across 18 of the most traded currencies, with an average daily settled value of&nbsp;<b>USD7.9 trillion&nbsp;</b>in H1 2025, up&nbsp;<b>12%&nbsp;</b>year-on-year.</p>
<p>As FX markets evolve, the demand for safe and efficient settlement mechanisms continues to grow, particularly among financial institutions seeking to align with the best practices outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Lisa Danino-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer, CLS&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;OTP Bank&rsquo;s decision to become a settlement member reflects the broader trend of financial institutions focusing on mitigating FX settlement risk and increasing efficiencies delivered through multilateral netting. Multilateral netting yields significant liquidity benefits for CLS settlement members, resulting in liquidity savings of approximately 96%, enabling cash flow to be available for other business operations like trading and business growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Attila B&aacute;nfi, Managing Director of OTP Global Markets&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Mitigating FX settlement risk is a key priority for OTP Bank. Joining CLSSettlement as a settlement member reflects our dedication to creating a more robust FX ecosystem, and our commitment to adopting best practices across our risk management and middle office functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Principle 35 states,&nbsp;<i>inter alia</i>:</p>
<p>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement.</p>
<p>Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For July 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2025-202587/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2025-202587/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bilateral U.S. trade agreements concluded in mid-July 2025 with reciprocal tariffs finalized at 19 percent for Indonesia and 20 percent for Vietnam have established a major regional benchmark. This development has led to consensus among analysts that Thailand will likely secure similar terms and conditions in its tariff negotiation with the U.S. and that such an agreement will particularly benefit industries with high foreign revenue exposure. Meanwhile, the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) revised Thailand&rsquo;s 2025 GDP growth forecast from 2.1 percent to 2.2 percent. These favorable catalysts drove the SET Index to rally in July 2025 with a surge of 14.0 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> noted that the weakening Dollar Index in July 2025 drove renewed emerging market inflows across Asian equity markets as foreign funds rebalanced their portfolios. The Thai stock market particularly benefitted from compelling valuations and baht appreciation, a factor which typically attracts foreign fund inflows. The SET Index maintained its strong upward trajectory with foreign net buying recorded on 14 days out of 21 trading days in July 2025, marking the first month of foreign net buying since September 2024, with aggregate net buying of THB 16.12 billion (approx. USD493.12 million).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FPO's upward GDP revision was based on assumptions that Thailand's economic expansion would continue to be driven by private consumption, public investment, and inbound tourism, with visitor arrivals projected to reach 34.5 million. Export growth forecast was significantly upgraded to 5.5 percent from the previous 2.3 percent estimate, driven by accelerated shipments in the first half of 2025 as exporters sought to front-load deliveries to mitigate risks associated with trade wars. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 9-2 to maintain the benchmark rate in the 4.25 &ndash; 4.5 percent range for the fifth consecutive meeting. The statement by the Federal Reserve (Fed) chair reflected elevated uncertainty over tax policies and potential impact on both inflation and U.S. labor markets, sustaining the central bank's cautious monetary policy stance. Thailand-Cambodia border disputes continue to represent regional geopolitical risk factors.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for July 2025</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2025, the SET Index surged 14.0 percent MoM to close at 1,242.35 points, significantly outpacing most regional exchanges and reducing the YTD decrease to 11.3 percent.</li>
<li>Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology, Financials, Resources, and Industrials.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value rose 12.1 percent YoY to THB 42.62 billion, with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 41.97 billion, decreasing 5.0 percent YoY. Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, accounting for 50.68 percent of July&rsquo;s total trading value which was the highest among all investor categories. They registered a net buying position of THB 16.12 billion, marking the first month of net buying since September 2024.</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of July 2025 was 13.8 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 13.0 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 14.3 times, lower than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 14.8 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of July 2025 was 3.95 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.17 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 355,290 contracts, down 19.8 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 425,984 contracts, down 11.9 percent due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>ASX Supports Strong And Effective Capital Markets In Australia</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Helen Lofthouse, ASX Managing Director and CEO commented: </b></p>
<p>&ldquo;ASX is supportive of competition that contributes to strong and effective capital markets in Australia. Our listings business, which competes with other local, regional and global exchanges, continues to offer one of the world&rsquo;s leading listing venues with more than 2,000 listed entities. We also compete with Cboe in Australia in trading and in listing exchange traded funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public markets play a critical role in supporting companies to raise capital for growth opportunities, and we&rsquo;re confident in the strong value proposition that ASX provides. We&rsquo;ve seen another example of that today with Light &amp; Wonder&rsquo;s announcement that it plans to move from a dual listing to being solely listed on ASX. This is expected in November and would make it a top 50 ASX company based on its current market capitalisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As public markets continue to grow, we remain focused on how we can continue to enhance Australia&rsquo;s position as a globally competitive, deep and liquid market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since January, ASX has welcomed 46 entities and has added $51 billion in net new capital. The increased IPO activity along with secondary capital raisings is a sign of renewed momentum in listings, and we continue to see interest from companies considering a listing.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission: Harpreet Saini Guilty Of Insider Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-harpreet-saini-guilty-of-insider-trading-202586/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-harpreet-saini-guilty-of-insider-trading-202586/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today that Harpreet Saini of Brampton has been sentenced to six months less a day in jail after pleading guilty on July 25, 2024 to insider trading pursuant to s. 76(1) of Ontario&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>.</p>
<p>As part of his sentence, the Court ordered Mr. Saini to pay a fine in the amount of $1,149,114.93 encompassing disgorgement of all his profits and an additional $100,000. He will also be subject to various trading bans for 10 years pursuant to the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>. In addition, the&nbsp;<em>Provincial Offences Act&nbsp;</em>imposes a mandatory 25% fine surcharge that brings Mr. Saini&rsquo;s overall exposure to $1,436,393.66.</p>
<p>Mr. Saini acknowledged that between May 2018 and July 2021, he accessed material non-public information through his employer, a newswire distribution network specializing in corporate press releases. Mr. Saini worked as a software developer, which allowed him to access corporate press release headlines before they were published. He then traded securities 553 times based on the headlines of 497 unpublished press releases. In total, he realized illicit gains exceeding $770,000 USD from more than 400 trades.</p>
<p>In September 2022, both Mr. Saini and a co-accused, John Natividad, were charged under the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>. The charges relating to Mr. Natividad are still before the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Employees who have access to confidential corporate information have a duty to safeguard that information and not misuse it for their personal benefit,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President, Enforcement, OSC. &ldquo;Insider trading is illegal, and it erodes investor confidence in our markets. The OSC will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to root out this type of misconduct and pursue bad actors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This case was brought by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or Court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. To do this, they often partner and collaborate with other law enforcement agencies and police forces. Charges laid under the&nbsp;<em>Securities Ac</em>t are prosecuted by the OSC. Charges laid under the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code</em>&nbsp;are prosecuted by the Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The staff is committed to assisting broker-dealers and other market participants on the path to central clearing in the U.S. Treasury market,&rdquo; said Jamie Selway, Director of the Division of Trading and Markets. &ldquo;FAQs are one of the numerous ways in which Commission staff is continuing to engage to provide clarity to market participants as the compliance dates of Dec. 31, 2026, and June 30, 2027, approach, for cash and repo respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Separately, Chairman Paul S. Atkins today announced that Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda will lead the agency&rsquo;s continued efforts related to central clearing of U.S. Treasuries.</p>

Industry has raised a number of areas where the transition effort could benefit from further guidance, and today the staff made progress on providing clarification. There&rsquo;s work still to be done, both at the agency and within industry, and Commissioner Uyeda and I look forward to engaging with stakeholders to make sure we get this right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Uyeda said, &ldquo;The U.S. Treasury market plays a key role in global finance and is of central importance to our country and the world. The SEC is committed to engaging with market participants, central banks, and fellow regulators to make sure the policies we implement enhance the Treasury market&rsquo;s functioning.&rdquo;</p>

<title>July 2025 Figures At Eurex</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/july-2025-figures-at-eurex-202586/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Eurex trading volumes dip by 10 percent amid calmer markets in July.</li>
<li>OTC Clearing sees strong 28 percent growth in notional outstanding volumes.</li>
<li>Eurex Repo posts solid growth in July, GC Pooling surges 19 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurex &mdash; Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s leading central counterparties &mdash; saw trading volumes decline in July, reflecting more subdued market conditions. The exchange reported a total of 138.9 million contracts traded during the month &mdash; a 10 percent drop compared to the 154.3 million recorded in July last year. Despite the overall decrease, interest rate derivatives showed resilience, rising by 10 percent year-on-year to reach 75.4 million contracts. In contrast, equity derivatives trading fell by 19 percent to 18.6 million contracts. Index derivatives also saw a decline, with volumes dropping 30 percent to 44.3 million contracts.</p>
<p>OTC Clearing recorded a notable increase in July, with notional outstanding volumes climbing by 28 percent compared to July 2024. Total volumes reached EUR 45,770 billion, up from EUR 35,789 billion during the same period in 2024. Overnight index swaps led the surge, posting a 57 percent rise to EUR 5,901 billion. Interest rate swaps also contributed significantly, growing by 26 percent to EUR 19,207 billion.</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, reported a 4 percent increase in average term-adjusted volumes for July 2025, reaching EUR 388.0 billion. The growth was largely driven by strong performance in the GC Pooling segment, which jumped 19 percent compared to the same period last year. In contrast, the Repo Market segment saw a 9 percent decline. Despite contrasting trends across segments, Eurex Repo maintained upward momentum with a 3 percent year-on-year increase in volumes through July.</p>

<p>This no-action letter formalises the guidance already provided in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-launches-consultation-amended-disclosure-requirements-esg-risks-equity-exposures-and-aggregate">EBA&rsquo;s Consultation Paper published in May 2025</a>&nbsp;on the amending ITS of the EBA Pillar 3 disclosure framework. In particular, it includes the following recommendations to competent authorities until the EBA amending ITS included in the Consultation Paper enter into force:</p>
<ul>
<li>To not prioritise the enforcement of the disclosure of certain ESG disclosure templates (notably EU 6 to EU 10, and specific columns in Templates 1 and 4) of the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/3172/oj/eng">Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3172</a>, for large institutions with listed securities;</li>
<li>To not prioritise the enforcement of the collection of templates EU 6 to 10, and specific columns in Templates 1 and 4 of the EBA Decision&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/1061127/EBA%20DC%20498%20-%20Decision%20on%20institutions%20ESG%20data%20adhoc%20collection.pdf">EBA/DC/498 of 6 July 2023</a>, for large institutions with listed securities;</li>
<li>To not prioritise the enforcement of the disclosure of the corresponding ESG templates under the Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3172 for all other institutions recently brought under the scope of Article 449a of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The EBA remains committed to delivering a coherent and streamlined ESG disclosure framework and will continue to work closely with EU institutions and stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation of the new requirements.</p>
<p>The EBA is also publishing today an updated version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.eba.europa.eu/interactive-tools/2025/powerbi/ESG_dashboard_page%201.html"><span>EBA ESG risk dashboard</span></a>. The ESG risk landscape across EU/EEA banks appears stable, thus reflecting the long-term horizon of climate-related risks and the gradual pace of change in banking portfolios.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the content of the ESG risk dashboard will be adjusted in the next editions in line with the no-action letter, and the recommendations to authorities not to prioritise the enforcement of the disclosure of those specific templates and information.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The non-action letter has been drafted in accordance with Article 9c of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-no-action-letter-application-esg-disclosure-requirements-and-updates-eba-esg-risks#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;(EBA founding Regulation), which gives the EBA the power to issue no-action letters, if it considers that the application of one of the relevant legislative acts is liable to raise significant issues. This is the case when provisions contained in such act may directly conflict with another relevant act, and if based on some relevant information, the EBA considers that the application of the relevant provisions raises significant exceptional issues in terms of market confidence,&nbsp; customer or investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets, or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system in the Union.</p>
<p>Article 434a of the CRR mandates the EBA to develop ITS to specify uniform disclosure formats and accompanying IT solutions.</p>
<p>Article 449a of the CRR, as introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (CRR2), required large institutions with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market in a Member State to disclose their exposures to ESG risks. These requirements were further operationalised through the Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3172, which sets out detailed ITS for ESG disclosures.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) 2024/1624 (CRR3) amended Article 449a, expanding the scope of ESG disclosures to all institutions. These revised obligations apply from 1 January 2025.</p>
