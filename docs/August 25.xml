<h2><a id="introduction"></a>An introduction from Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke</h2>
<p><img height="180" src="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4zopxrdz/kate-orourke-portrait.jpeg?width=180&amp;height=180&amp;mode=max" width="180" /></p>
<p>The introduction of mandatory sustainability reporting in Australia represents the biggest change to reporting and auditing in a generation. ASIC is excited to launch our&nbsp;<em>Reporting and audit update</em>, a quarterly newsletter for report preparers, auditors, professional advisers, investors and consumers, and other finance professionals interested in keeping up to date with the regulatory developments affecting reporting and audit.</p>
<p>With a focus on sustainability and financial reporting and audit, we will include everything that&rsquo;s relevant to preparers, advisors and users of reports. This includes our news and reviews of financial and sustainability reports prepared by registrable superannuation entities (RSEs), registered schemes and companies.</p>
<p>We look forward to keeping industry professionals informed about regulatory developments in sustainability, financial reporting and auditing.</p>
<p>Kate O&rsquo;Rourke,</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner</p>
<h2><a id="climate"></a>Voluntary climate-related disclosures reviewed</h2>
<p>With the first round of mandatory sustainability reports due to be lodged with ASIC from March 2026, ASIC has reviewed a small sample of publicly available, voluntary climate-related disclosures.</p>
<p>ASIC considers the shift to mandatory reporting under the Corporations Act and AASB S2 will address many of the challenges of existing voluntary reporting practices.</p>
<p>Below, we share our observations to help entities as they prepare for mandatory reporting.</p>
<h3>Scope 3 disclosures</h3>
<p>As permitted by the standards, of the large companies we reviewed, most disclosed Scope 3 emissions by using a combination of direct emissions data received from suppliers and customers and secondary data such as industry averages.</p>
<h3>Disclosure detail and quality</h3>
<p>Our review of the voluntary disclosures, which we note was generally prepared under the recommendations of the&nbsp;<em>Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures</em>&nbsp;(TCFD), not AASB&nbsp;S2 &ndash; found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>disclosures were often repetitive, with key information about the management of climate-related risks and opportunities sometimes obscured, making it difficult for users to identify the key information</li>
<li>scenario analysis disclosures lacked detail about the underlying assumptions and dependencies relied on in the disclosures</li>
<li>where reporting entities had a transition plan, the related disclosures could have been more clearly linked to the entity&rsquo;s targets, actions and strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find out more</h3>
<p>ASIC will be pragmatic and proportionate in its approach as the mandatory sustainability reporting requirements are being phased in and as industry adjusts to the new requirements.</p>
<p>To learn more about the mandatory sustainability reporting requirements, visit ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/sustainability-reporting/" title="Sustainability reporting">sustainability reporting</a>&nbsp;webpage.</p>
<p>Regulatory Guide 280&nbsp;<em>Sustainability reporting</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-280-sustainability-reporting/" title="RG 280 Sustainability reporting">RG 280</a>) provides guidance to entities on preparing a sustainability report and how ASIC will exercise its powers under the law.</p>
<h2><a id="register"></a>Register of sustainability reporting relief decisions</h2>
<p>You can now view ASIC&rsquo;s sustainability reporting and audit relief decisions, on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/sustainability-reporting/asic-s-administration-of-the-sustainability-reporting-requirements/sustainability-reporting-and-audit-relief-decisions-register/" title="Sustainability reporting and audit relief decisions register">Sustainability reporting and audit relief decisions register</a>. This is where we publish the decisions made under ASIC&rsquo;s exemption powers in the Corporations Act that relate to sustainability reporting and auditing matters.</p>
<p>The purpose of the register is to provide transparency about decisions ASIC makes when we are asked to exercise ASIC&rsquo;s discretionary powers to grant relief under Ch 2M. Prospective applicants are encouraged to review the register before submitting a relief application as it will provide insights into the factors we consider in our decision-making process and conditions we may impose.</p>
<h3>Examples of relief</h3>
<p>Three unlisted wholly-owned entities of an RSE were recently granted relief from preparing stand-alone sustainability reports for one year. As the RSE will prepare consolidated sustainability reports (which includes the wholly-owned entities) in the subsequent financial year, ASIC was satisfied that the cost of preparing standalone, audited sustainability reports for a single financial year would impose an unreasonable financial burden on these entities.</p>
<p>Visit our Information Sheet 82&nbsp;<em>Apply for relief</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/dealing-with-asic/apply-for-relief/" title="Apply for relief">INFO 82</a>) to find out how to apply for relief, and for ASIC&rsquo;s general approach to granting relief, see Regulatory Guide 51&nbsp;<em>Applications for relief</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-51-applications-for-relief/" title="RG 51 Applications for relief">RG 51</a>) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-280-sustainability-reporting/" title="RG 280 Sustainability reporting">RG 280</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="education"></a>Educational materials to support sustainability reports</h2>
<p>ASIC and the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) are partnering with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">University of Technology Sydney</a>, and Sydney-based educational design agency&nbsp;<a href="https://studio3learning.com/">Studio 3 Learning</a>&nbsp;to develop educational materials explaining the core concepts underlying sustainability reporting in the Corporations Act. The materials will be aimed at Group 3 reporting entities that are required to prepare sustainability reports for the financial year commencing on or after 1 July 2027. It will also be of value to small and medium entities in the value chain of larger businesses and anyone who is new to sustainability reporting.</p>
<p>E-learning modules will make up the educational program, covering topics including climate-related physical risks and transitional risks, emissions accounting, scenario analysis, governance and risk management. We are aiming to make the materials available this year, and then ASIC will focus on conducting face-to-face sessions with the AASB and University of Technology Sydney in the format of workshops and roadshows during 2026.</p>
<h2><a id="intervention"></a>ASIC intervenes in misleading sustainability-related claims and conduct</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing supervision, ASIC has undertaken a range of sustainability-related interventions during the past financial year.</p>
<h3>ASIC sustainability-related cases</h3>
<p>Signalling ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to protecting investment consumers, the Federal Court imposed a combined $34.7 million in civil penalties for three greenwashing cases we initiated.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Ltd was fined $11.3 million by the court. A month later,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-213mr-asic-s-vanguard-greenwashing-action-results-in-record-12-9-million-penalty/" title="24-213MR ASIC's Vanguard greenwashing action results in record $12.9 million penalty">Vanguard Investments Australia was fined $12.9 million (24-213MR)</a>; and in March 2025,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-042mr-active-super-ordered-to-pay-10-5-million-penalty-in-asic-s-third-greenwashing-court-action/" title="25-042MR Active Super ordered to pay $10.5 million penalty in ASIC&rsquo;s third greenwashing court action">Active Super received a penalty of $10.5 million (25-042MR)</a>.</p>
<h3>Surveillance and findings summary</h3>
<p>During 2024-25, as part of ASIC&rsquo;s general supervision, we reviewed representations made by companies and trustees about their sustainability claims and credentials.</p>
<p>Our key concerns were entities making:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>unsubstantiated claims about the viability or feasibility of sustainability-related strategies, products or business models</li>
<li>claims about commitments to sustainability unsupported by identified specific actions, policies or processes, and</li>
<li>inadequate disclosures about environmental and climate-related physical and transition risks, particularly for companies in highly exposed sectors such as mining and resources and consumer staples.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of our interventions, 15 companies and 4 superannuation trustees removed, retracted or revised statements about their sustainability claims and credentials across a range of disclosures, including prospectuses, websites, promotional materials and market announcements.</p>
<h3>ASIC guidance on sustainability claims</h3>
<p>Entities making any kind of sustainability-related claim should consider the guidance set out in Information Sheet 271&nbsp;<em>How to avoid greenwashing when offering or promoting sustainability-related products</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/how-to-avoid-greenwashing-when-offering-or-promoting-sustainability-related-products/" title="How to avoid greenwashing when offering or promoting sustainability-related products">INFO 271</a>).</p>
<p>To view our key recommendations for avoiding greenwashing and sustainable finance-related misconduct and better practice examples, read our Report 763&nbsp;<em>ASIC&rsquo;s recent greenwashing interventions</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-763-asic-s-recent-greenwashing-interventions/" title="REP 763 ASIC&rsquo;s recent greenwashing interventions">REP 763</a>), and Report 791&nbsp;<em>ASIC&rsquo;s interventions on greenwashing misconduct</em><em>&nbsp;2023-2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-791-asic-s-interventions-on-greenwashing-misconduct-2023-2024/" title="REP 791 ASIC&rsquo;s interventions on greenwashing misconduct: 2023&ndash;2024">REP 791</a>).</p>
<h2><a id="sustainability"></a>Financial reporting and auditor surveillance update</h2>
<p>ASIC is now finalising its financial reporting and auditor surveillance work for 2024&ndash;25 and will publish its findings and best practice recommendations, during September and October. The three reports will cover auditor independence and conflicts of interest findings, RSE financial reporting and audit findings, and financial reporting and auditor surveillance findings.</p>
<h3>1. Registrable Superannuation Entity financial reporting and audit</h3>
<p>RSEs were required to lodge audited financial reports with ASIC for the first time in 2024. We are finalising our review of five RSE audit files and around half of all lodged RSE financial reports. We will review the other half of the RSE financial reports, as well as a selection of RSE audit files in our 2025-26 program.</p>
<p>Our focus areas for RSE financial reports and audits include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the measurement and disclosure of investment portfolios, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>disclosure of marketing and advertising expenses.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that 2024-25 was the first year of RSE financial reports and audit surveillance, ASIC will publish a separate report on its RSE findings in late September 2025.</p>
<h3>2. Auditor independence and conflict of interest obligations</h3>
<p>During the past year, we engaged with 48 auditors about how they complied with the independence and conflict of interest obligations of the Corporations Act. We wrote to Australian registered auditors about the planned review, which is part of ASIC&rsquo;s wider, ongoing work to improve the quality of financial reporting and audit in Australia.</p>
<p>Our surveillance included asking about auditor rotation, relationships between current and former members of audit firms and audited companies, long association and whether the provision of non-audit services may compromise independence or raise conflicts of interest concerns.</p>
<p>ASIC will publish the outcomes of this surveillance in October 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Financial reporting and audits</h3>
<p>Our surveillance of financial reports and audits focuses on areas where significant judgement from preparers of financial reports or auditors is required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>revenue recognition&nbsp;</li>
<li>asset valuation, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>estimation of provisions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit surveillance report for reviews conducted between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025 will be published in late October 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all report preparers and auditors to review the findings of our report, which will appear with our other regulatory resources on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/" title="Reports">Reports</a>&nbsp;webpage when available.</p>

<p>The Financial advice update is a round-up of regulatory developments and issues affecting financial advice.</p>
<p>It covers all areas of financial advice regulation and includes a broad range of content relevant to Australian financial services (AFS) licensees who are advice licensees and financial advisers.</p>
<p>The topics of this update are:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><a id="dataset"></a>NOW LIVE! One-off point-in-time dataset to help AFS licensees</h2>
<p>AFS licensees can access ASIC&rsquo;s one-off, point-in-time&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards/providing-tax-financial-advice-services/">dataset</a>&nbsp;to help them identify information on the Financial Advisers Register that needs to be corrected or updated. From 15 August 2025, this updated dataset will include if an AFS licensee has notified ASIC that a relevant provider has made a declaration that they are relying on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard and the date the relevant provider passed the exam.</p>
<p><strong>AFS licensees must ensure the information recorded on the Financial Advisers Register is correct for the relevant providers they authorise.</strong></p>
<p>Where the information is incorrect or out of date, AFS licensees must notify ASIC of the change within 30 business days of the change occurring to avoid a late fee. It is an offence to knowingly provide false or misleading information to ASIC or to fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information provided to ASIC is true and correct, which includes updating the Financial Advisers Register.</p>
<p>Common errors identified in ASIC&rsquo;s spot checks of information on the Financial Advisers Register include:</p>
<ul>
<li>relevant providers being marked as relying on the experienced provider pathway when they do not appear eligible </li>
<li>relevant providers&rsquo; qualifications and training courses marked as going toward meeting the qualifications standard when the course(s) has not been completed or is not an approved course of study, and </li>
<li>no information (or incorrect information) about the capacity in which the relevant provider can provide tax (financial) advice services.</li>
</ul>
<p>AFS licensees and relevant providers can also review the information recorded on the Financial Advisers Register at&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/">moneysmart.gov.au</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://data.gov.au/">data.gov.au</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="reg-rel-prov"></a>Registration of relevant providers &ndash; ASIC warnings and reprimands</h2>
<p>To date, ASIC has issued 12 warnings and reprimands to relevant providers who provided personal advice to retail clients for relevant financial products while unregistered.</p>
<p>It is important for both the authorising AFS licensee and the relevant provider to ensure that personal advice is not provided while the relevant provider is unregistered.</p>
<p>If a relevant provider gives personal advice while unregistered, they will be in breach of a restricted civil penalty provision and may be subject to regulatory action. The relevant provider&rsquo;s authorising AFS licensee will also have committed an offence of strict liability and contravened a civil penalty provision.</p>
<p>Common circumstances where AFS licensees are failing to register their relevant providers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the relevant provider changes AFS licensee and the new AFS licensee does not register the relevant provider with ASIC.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="market"></a>Market scan: Professional indemnity insurance</h2>
<p>Between November 2024 and February 2025, ASIC conducted a market scan of the professional indemnity (PI) insurance market for AFS licensees that provide personal advice to retail clients.</p>
<p>The market scan involved discussions with industry, together with data-driven analysis of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&rsquo;s National Claims and Policies Database for the period up to 31 December 2023.</p>
<p>The review noted the cyclical nature of the PI insurance market and identified significant improvements in PI insurance market conditions at the time, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>more supply and competition</li>
<li>return to profitability</li>
<li>premium reductions, and</li>
<li>reduced claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also saw a reduction in reports to ASIC and AFS licensing issues &ndash; between 2020 and 2025 there was a significant reduction in the number of AFS licensees reporting breaches for PI insurance (for example, because they do not have or cannot obtain adequate cover) and in the number of AFS licensees seeking relief or exemptions from the requirement to hold PI insurance. We have also observed fewer AFS licence applicants citing difficulties with obtaining PI insurance.</p>
<p>However, despite these improvements, several issues and concerns were identified in the operation of the PI insurance market for advice licensees. One consistent theme was a lack of transparency around what cover advice licensees hold and the claims they make. Another concern was the time it takes to finalise claims.</p>
<p>We have noted these findings and are considering ways in which these issues and concerns may be addressed.</p>

<h2><a id="fscp"></a>Update from the Financial Services and Credit Panel</h2>
<p>The Financial Services and Credit Panel (FSCP) makes disciplinary decisions on relevant providers. The FSCP has now been in operation for over two years. The FSCP is a pool of industry participants appointed by the responsible minister that ASIC draws upon when forming individual sitting panels.</p>
<p>ASIC maintains the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/how-asic-regulates-financial-advice/financial-services-and-credit-panel-fscp/fscp-outcomes-register/" title="FSCP Outcomes Register">FSCP Outcomes Register</a>, which contains decisions of the FSCP and a brief explanation of the background to the decisions. Some recent outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A two-year registration prohibition order against Glenn Paul Meilak. The FSCP found that Mr Meilak gave advice to his clients recommending that they set up self-managed superannuation funds. Mr Meilak exhibited conduct that was systemic, displayed a lack of care and a level of incompetence in providing advice to his clients: see Media Release (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-014mr-financial-services-and-credit-panel-issues-registration-prohibition-order-against-financial-adviser/" title="25-014MR Financial Services and Credit Panel issues registration prohibition order against financial adviser">25-014MR</a>)&nbsp;<em>Financial Services and Credit Panel issues registration prohibition order against financial adviser</em>&nbsp;(11 February 2025).</li>
<li>A written direction to have the next 10 pieces of advice audited by a compliance expert after failing to act in the best interest of the client and provide advice that was appropriate for the client. The relevant provider recommended the client make a concessional superannuation contribution without considering the client had already triggered a bring-forward arrangement.</li>
<li>A written direction to report certain specified matters to ASIC after the panel found the relevant provider contravened section 961G of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;by giving advice that was not appropriate and section 961J by prioritising the relevant provider&rsquo;s interest over the client&rsquo;s interest. The FSCP&rsquo;s decision noted the relevant provider failed to ensure their fees and charges were fair, reasonable, and represented value for money by charging extraordinary fees for advice that was not appropriate and was conflicted. The specified items to be reported included a report produced by a compliance consultant following a comprehensive licensee review, a report produced by the compliance consultant containing results of the pre-vetting of the next 10 pieces of advice, and documentation showing the successful completion of an ethics and professionalism course.</li>

<title>Comptroller Of The US Currency Gould Issues Statement On Executive Order “Guaranteeing Fair Banking For All Americans”</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould today issued the following statement in support of the Executive Order, &ldquo;Guaranteeing Fair Banking For All Americans,&rdquo; issued by President Donald J. Trump:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair access to financial services is a fundamental principle of the U.S. banking system. It is unacceptable for banks to discriminate against any customer on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities. Today&rsquo;s Executive Order affirms that banks should provide access to financial services based on individualized, objective, and risk-based analyses.</p>
<p>The OCC has already taken initial steps to depoliticize the federal banking system consistent with the President&rsquo;s Executive Order. Earlier this year, the OCC removed references to reputation risk from its handbooks and guidance documents. Soon it will propose a rule removing these same references from its regulations. The OCC will also commence a review to assess the extent to which the institutions it supervises have or are engaged in politicized or unlawful debanking and take remedial actions if appropriate. The OCC is exploring additional steps to ensure politicized or unlawful debanking is never repeated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SIFMA released the following statement from Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., SIFMA President and CEO, on an Executive Order signed by President Trump today related to expanding private market investment choices in retirement accounts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helping Americans build savings for retirement is among the most important roles of the capital markets and SIFMA strongly supports policy efforts aimed at increasing retirement security for all. Today, U.S. workers increasingly rely on individually funded retirement plans, such as 401ks. As more U.S. companies choose to remain non-public, private markets have developed into a more robust asset class. &nbsp;Access to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors. Policy changes to expand access to private markets investments &ndash; appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules &ndash; could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers. We applaud the Trump Administration for the focus on this important issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The divisions will not recommend the CFTC initiate an enforcement action against either entity or their participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions and variable payout contract transactions executed on or subject to the rules of Railbird and cleared through QC Clearing, subject to the terms of the no-action letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The no-action letter applies only&nbsp;in narrow circumstances and is comparable to no-action letters issued for other similarly situated designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<title>New York State Department Of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris Secures $48.5 Million Settlement With Paxos Trust Company For Anti-Money Laundering Deficiencies And Diligence Failures With Relation To Binance Partnership</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>DFS Investigation Found Deficient Transaction Monitoring and Compliance Program Led to Increased Money-Laundering Risk</span></li>
<li>Settlement Requires Paxos to Pay $26.5 Million Penalty and to Invest an Additional $22 Million in its Compliance Program</li>
</ul>
<p>New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris today announced that Paxos Trust Company (&ldquo;Paxos&rdquo;) will pay a $26.5 million penalty to New York State for failure to conduct sufficient due diligence of its former partner, Binance, and systemic failures in Paxos&rsquo;s anti-money laundering program. In addition to the penalty, Paxos has agreed to invest an additional $22 million to improve its compliance program and remediate deficiencies pursuant to a plan approved by DFS.</p>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;The Department of Financial Services has led the nation in regulating the virtual currency industry, protecting consumers and markets through examinations, supervision, and where necessary, enforcement,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said Superintendent Harris.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Regulated entities must maintain appropriate risk management frameworks that correspond to their business risks, which includes relationships with business partners and third-party vendors. The Department continues taking significant steps to ensure accountability, in turn protecting consumers and safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Paxos was chartered as a limited purpose trust company and authorized to engage in virtual currency business by the Department in 2015 and later formed a relationship with Binance to market and distribute the Binance USD (&ldquo;BUSD&rdquo;) stablecoin. Under the terms of its agreement with the Department, Paxos was required to perform regular due diligence of Binance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Department&rsquo;s investigation revealed that Paxos did not have appropriate controls in place to effectively monitor for significant illicit activity occurring at or through Binance, and failed to escalate red flags to Paxos&rsquo;s senior management and its Board. Notably, Binance&rsquo;s lax geofencing restrictions enabled U.S. users to access an unregulated exchange. A review of historical Binance transactions between 2017 and 2022, across a select set of virtual currency assets, concluded that $1.6 billion in transactions flowed to or from the Binance platform involving illicit actors and found that Binance had processed transactions to and from entities after the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In February 2023, DFS was the first regulator in the world to address safety and soundness concerns related to Binance, ordering that Paxos Trust cease minting Paxos-issued BUSD, and oversaw the first orderly winddown of a stablecoin.  After DFS took this supervisory action, federal and foreign regulators quickly followed in DFS&rsquo;s footsteps.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In addition to Paxos&rsquo;s failures related to Binance, the Department&rsquo;s investigation revealed that Paxos operated a deficient compliance program for years. As a result of its unsophisticated Know Your Customer/Customer Due Diligence program, customers who shared addresses, corporate documents, beneficial owners, and certain behavioral characteristics indicative of potential illicit coordinated activity were able to open multiple accounts and remain undetected. Paxos&rsquo;s deficient transaction monitoring system also prevented the Company from detecting obvious patterns of money laundering, thus exacerbating its onboarding compliance deficiencies. In addition, Paxos lacked defined guidelines regarding when investigations should be opened following receipt of a law enforcement request. This deficiency prevented the Company from more readily identifying bad actors on its platform.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Daniel Pugh has been found guilty of fraud, following a prosecution by the FCA.</p>
<p><span>Mr Pugh, aged 35 and of Devon, set up a Ponzi scheme that netted over &pound;1m. Through his fraudulent Imperial Investment Fund (IIF), Mr Pugh took money from 238 investors he targeted largely through Facebook adverts. They were offered impossibly high returns of 1.4% a day, 7% a week or 350% a year.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA will commence confiscation proceedings in order to recover the proceeds of crime.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>'Mr Pugh deliberately defrauded unsuspecting investors. Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA and we are committed to holding fraudsters to account.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Pugh was today found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud. At the start of the trial he pleaded guilty to carrying out unauthorised regulated activity which breached sections 19 and 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A further individual remains wanted in relation to the same offences. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Daniel Pugh&rsquo;s date of birth is 19 April 1990.</li>
<li>The FCA has attempted to contact investors who lost out. Anyone who was scammed by IIF and has not heard from the FCA should call or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ophainesconsumercontact@fca.org.uk">ophainesconsumercontact@fca.org.uk</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart" title="ScamSmart">ScamSmart</a>&nbsp;page has advice on how to spot and avoid investment scams.</li>
<li>Mr Pugh was charged on 18 July 2023.</li>
<li>Mr Pugh&rsquo;s trial took place at Southwark Crown Court.</li>
<li>Conspiracy to defraud is an offence under common law with a maximum sentence of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>Under section 19 of FSMA, a person cannot carry on a regulated activity in the UK unless they are FCA authorised or exempt. Any person who breaches this is committing a criminal offence for which the maximum sentence is two years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>Under section 21 of FSMA, a person must not communicate an invitation or inducement to invest unless they are FCA authorised or the content of the communication is approved by an authorised person. Any person who breaches this is committing a criminal offence for which the maximum sentence is two years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>

<title>The EBA Consults On Revised Guidelines On Internal Governance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-revised-guidelines-on-internal-governance-202587/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-revised-guidelines-on-internal-governance-202587/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a consultation on its revised Guidelines on internal governance under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The proposed revisions reflect the changes introduced in the CRD framework as well as in other relevant legislations, such as the Digital Operational Resilience Acts (DORA). The consultation runs until 5 October 2025 and is limited to the proposed changes.</span></p>
<p>The draft revised Guidelines have been amended to reflect the changes brought by CRD VI. They&nbsp;specify further the requirements under Article 88(3) of CRD VI, to ensure that each member of the management body, senior manager and key function holder have a documented statement of role and duties, and that a mapping of duties of the members of the management body, senior managers and key function holders&nbsp;has been drawn up.&nbsp; They also provide specific guidance to ensure that third-country branches have a robust governance framework in place.</p>
<p>The draft revised Guidelines have been amended also to ensure alignment with the DORA Regulation and take into account the findings of the EBA benchmarking Report of diversity practices and gender-neutral remuneration policies.&nbsp;Finally, they also consider the lessons learned from supervisory practices across the EU.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper&nbsp;can be sent&nbsp;by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page.&nbsp;The&nbsp;deadline for the submission of comments&nbsp;is 5 October&nbsp;2025.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual&nbsp;<span>public hearing</span>&nbsp;<span>on 5 September from 11:30 to 13:00</span>&nbsp;- Paris time. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-crd6-governance-package-gl-internal-governance-gl-sound-management-third-party-risk">link</a>&nbsp;by 1 September (16:00 CEST).&nbsp;The dial-in details&nbsp;will be communicated&nbsp;to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>All contributions received&nbsp;will be published&nbsp;following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;Guidelines&nbsp;on internal governance&nbsp;have been developed in accordance with Article 74(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, which mandates the EBA to draft guidelines in this area, and in accordance with&nbsp;Article 48g(9) of Directive 2013/36/EU, which mandates the EBA to draft guidelines on internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms for third country branches.</p>
<p>The revision of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance is part of EBA&rsquo;s roadmap on the implementation of the banking package (CRR III / CRDV VI) which came into application on 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;January 2025 and will, together with its set of regulatory products, further underpin a robust regulatory framework, efficient supervision, and enhanced risk control by credit institutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Bursa Malaysia Berhad </b>(&ldquo;<b>Bursa Malaysia</b>&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Exchange&rdquo;) in collaboration with <b>CGS International Securities Malaysia Sdn Bhd</b> (&ldquo;<b>CGS MY</b>&rdquo;) held the annual Invest Shariah Conference today, highlighting the rising prominence of Shariah-compliant investments as a form of value-driven investing, in response to shifting global economic dynamics. In its fifth year, the 2025 theme <b>&ldquo;Innovating Islamic Finance: Unlocking Global Investment Potential&rdquo;</b>, brought together renowned financial leaders, Shariah scholars, and investors to discuss cross-border capital flows, innovation in Shariah-compliant offerings, fintech developments, and investing opportunities in Islamic capital market.</p>
<p><b>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed</b>, <b>Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia </b>in his welcome remarks said, &nbsp;&ldquo;Islamic finance is fast asserting its global prominence, reshaping how markets align financial returns with ethical values. As investor expectations shift, Malaysia must strengthen its position through broader offerings, deeper connectivity and inclusive digital access. At Bursa Malaysia, we support Malaysia&rsquo;s leadership by strengthening market infrastructure, expanding reach and driving innovation across Shariah-compliant product segments. In addition, we believe the future must be shaped through collaboration and that is why today&rsquo;s Invest Shariah Conference matters. It brings together diverse perspectives to spark new ideas that will help shape the next chapter of Islamic capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Puan Azizah Mohd Yatim</b>, <b>Chief Executive Officer of CGS MY</b> said, &ldquo;Malaysia has an established, internationally recognised framework and end-to-end ecosystem for Islamic capital market. We also have the depth and breadth of Shariah products, assets and instruments to &lsquo;export&rsquo; our products and solutions regionally and globally. Islamic capital market and Shariah instruments provide a fundamental, value-based approach that investors and businesses can trust. This is especially important in today&rsquo;s environment, and their growing demand is proof of the propositions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CGS MY currently offers 10 Islamic products, with more in the pipeline. This year, we launched several market firsts, amongst which was access to fractional share trading on Bursa Malaysia for the first&nbsp; time. Via our UP trading platform, investors can invest in the Exchange&rsquo;s top 30 stocks in the FBM KLCI index, of which at least 70% are Shariah-compliant stocks. Last month, CGS MY became the first broker in Malaysia to launch the <i>Islamic Equity Linked Investment Notes</i> and <i>Islamic Autocallable Equity Structured Investment Notes </i>structured products for sophisticated investors. In the coming months we will be rolling out Islamic Repurchase Agreement product in Malaysia and ESG Margin Financing-i in Singapore and Indonesia. Through accessible, investor-friendly innovations, we aim to make Shariah investing more inclusive and impactful for a broader segment of investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Globally, 80% of the Islamic finance industry assets remain concentrated in five markets: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. The industry continues to expand, with global assets projected to increase to USD7.5 trillion by 2028, up from USD5.5 trillion in 2024,&nbsp; underscoring its&nbsp; global relevance and prominence<sup>1</sup>. Malaysia continues to lead the Islamic capital market with total Shariah-compliant assets now exceeding RM2.6 trillion, representing 63% of the total capital market as at end-20242. The country also holds the world&rsquo;s largest sukuk market share at 36%, and over 80% of companies listed on Bursa Malaysia are Shariah-compliant.</p>
<p>The full-day conference featured panel discussions and fireside chats covering a wide range of themes, including the strengthening of capital flows between Asia and the Middle East, the rise of private equity and venture capital in Islamic capital markets, and the role of digital transformation in reshaping Shariah-compliant investment products. Speakers also explored how Islamic capital market can serve as a driver of inclusive growth, highlighting emerging opportunities in fintech, multi-asset investments, ESG integration, and sukuk issuance.</p>
<p>Bursa Malaysia and CGS MY extend their sincere appreciation to the speakers from around the region for their valuable insights, as well as to delegates. The Invest Shariah conference helps shape conversations and progress for a vibrant Islamic capital market in Malaysia, and to strengthen its contribution to the broader development of the global Islamic finance landscape.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Solactive is pleased to announce its latest collaboration with CAIS Advisors LLC. The newly introduced Solactive CAIS Private Credit BDC Index aims to serve as a transparent and rulebased benchmark, tailored specifically for the wealth channel. This index is the first in a planned series of private market indices, offering advisors a standardized way to measure performance in the rapidly expanding alternative asset market.</p>
<p>Private credit, particularly through non-traded Business Development Companies (BDCs), continues to gain momentum as demand for alternative investments broadens across the market. According to a recent CAISMercer survey, 66% of financial advisors now favor registered fund structures&mdash;such as BDCs, interval funds, or non-traded REITs&mdash;over traditional private drawdown vehicles&sup1;. As the democratization of alternative investments continues, advisors require institutional-grade tools to evaluate these strategies&mdash;tools previously unavailable in the private market.</p>
<p>Th<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0Q8F7">e </a><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0Q8F7">Solactive CAIS Private Credit BDC Index</a><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0Q8F7"> </a><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0Q8F7">t</a>racks the performance of non-traded, perpetual-life BDCs regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), operating as private credit vehicles. The index targets diversification by adjusting component weights and limiting oversized holdings. Eligible companies must have total net assets of at least $200 million and a minimum of one SEC reporting period.</p>
<p>The index ticker is CAISCRED (ISIN: DE000SL0Q8F7), and it was officially published on August 6, 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steffen Scheuble, Chief Executive Officer at Solactive, commented:</span> &ldquo;We are excited to introduce this industry-leading private credit BDC index with CAIS and look forward to strengthening our partnership with upcoming indices. This benchmark offers a much-needed transparent, rules-based tool for advisors navigating an increasingly complex alternative investment landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advisor demand for registered products continues to grow, but until now, advisors have often relied on fragmented benchmarking and data analytics when analyzing private market allocations,&rdquo; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">said Neil Blundell,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chief Investment Officer at CAIS Advisors. </span>&ldquo;We partnered with Solactive, a leading index provider and recognized innovator, because of our shared vision for solving this gap in the market. This index series seeks to deliver transparent, reliable benchmarks that allow advisors to better evaluate, track, and compare private market allocations.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, August 2025</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 6 August 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 5&ndash;4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather than maintaining it at 4.25%.</p>
<p>There has been substantial disinflation over the past two and a half years, following previous external shocks, supported by the restrictive stance of monetary policy. That progress has allowed for reductions in Bank Rate over the past year. The Committee remains focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures, to return inflation sustainably to its 2% target in the medium term.</p>
<p>The path of disinflation in underlying domestic price and wage pressures has generally continued, albeit to different degrees. Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 3.5% in 2025 Q2, owing to developments in energy, food and administered prices. Pay growth remains elevated, but has declined further recently, and is still expected to slow significantly over the rest of the year. Services consumer price inflation has been broadly flat over recent months. The Committee continues to be vigilant about the extent to which easing pay pressures will feed through to consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>CPI inflation is forecast to increase slightly further to peak at 4.0% in September. Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter towards the 2% target, although the Committee remains alert to the risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Overall, the MPC judges that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures have moved slightly higher since May.</p>
<p>Underlying UK GDP growth has remained subdued, consistent with a continued, gradual loosening in the labour market. A margin of slack is judged to have emerged in the economy. Downside domestic and geopolitical risks around economic activity remain, although trade policy uncertainty has diminished somewhat.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to reduce Bank Rate to 4%. A gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. The restrictiveness of monetary policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced.&nbsp;The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy will depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures continue to ease. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path, and the Committee will remain responsive to the accumulation of evidence.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 6 August 2025</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices. The latest data on these topics were set out in the accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2025/august-2025">August 2025 Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p>2: The Committee discussed recent developments in international trade policies and their implications for the UK. US tariff rates had remained at higher levels than in the period preceding the initial announcements by the US administration in April. However, uncertainty around trade had reduced since the May Monetary Policy Report as the US had reached trade agreements with some countries. The reduction in tariff rates relative to those assumed in the May Report implied that global demand would be slightly stronger in the baseline projection. Global developments had, nevertheless, not played a large role in the policy discussions at this MPC meeting.</p>
<p>3: Developments in international trade policies had also generally supported sentiment in financial markets, such that financial conditions had loosened a little since the MPC&rsquo;s June meeting. Measures of financial market volatility had either remained stable or fallen somewhat. UK and US equity prices had increased, with estimates of equity risk premia across advanced economies falling. Spreads on investment grade corporate bonds had tightened.</p>
<p>4: The near-term market-implied path for Bank Rate was relatively little changed since the Committee&rsquo;s June meeting but was a little higher than the path assumed in the May Report. Almost all respondents to the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting, similar to market pricing. The median profile in the August MaPS implied a cumulative 50 basis point reduction in Bank Rate by the end of this year, broadly in line with market pricing.</p>
<p>5: Monthly UK GDP growth in April and May had been -0.3% and -0.1% respectively. These outturns suggested that stronger GDP growth earlier in the year had, in part, been driven by international tariff or domestic tax-related front-loading. The S&amp;P Global UK PMI future output index had risen over past months, and the output index had also risen but by less. Bank staff estimated that GDP growth had been 0.1% in 2025 Q2, in line with the projection in the May Report, and growth was expected to pick up to 0.3% in Q3.</p>
<p>6: The Committee discussed the extent to which developments in activity had fed through to spare capacity in the economy. There had continued to be a gradual loosening in the labour market. Weak underlying employment growth in recent quarters had largely been ascribed to weakness in underlying demand and, more recently, an increase in firms&rsquo; costs. The LFS unemployment rate had increased further in the three months to May, as expected. Vacancies had remained below their estimated equilibrium levels, with other indicators and statistical models pointing to further increases in spare capacity.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>7: The evidence from a range of sources and Bank staff analysis suggested that disinflation in underlying price and wage pressures had generally continued, albeit to different degrees. Annual private sector regular AWE growth had declined further in the most recent data, to just below 5%. This was weaker than expected in the May Report, but consistent with a range of other indicators. AWE growth nevertheless remained above what Bank models could explain. Developments in pay settlements, the latest DMP Survey and Agents&rsquo; intelligence suggested a further weakening in pay growth in coming quarters, to around 3&frac34;% by the end of the year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>8: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.6% in June, slightly above expectations at the time of both the May Report and the Committee&rsquo;s June meeting, reflecting upside news in food, energy and services prices. Services price inflation had remained unchanged at 4.7% in June. Underlying services price inflation had continued to moderate, but at a slower pace than last year based on some measures.</p>
<p>9: CPI inflation was expected to rise a little further, to just over 3&frac34;% in 2025 Q3, before falling back towards the 2% target. The return of inflation towards target would be supported by an expected gradual reduction in food price inflation next year. Box E in the August Report discussed the risks related to food price inflation, including the potential for it to have an outsized influence on households&rsquo; formation of inflation expectations. The Committee discussed the extent to which the lag from wage growth through to services price inflation was operating in line with historical trends. Looking beyond the temporary factors putting upward pressure on prices this year, wage and services price disinflation would be key drivers of CPI inflation settling sustainably at the target.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>10: The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>11: The Committee&rsquo;s policy deliberations at this meeting had focused on a number of factors, including the extent to which disinflation was continuing, the degree of slack building in the economy, and the current and future restrictiveness of the monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>12: Disinflation in underlying domestic price and wage pressures had generally continued, albeit to different degrees. Core CPI and services price inflation had been broadly unchanged in recent months. Continued moderation in wage growth was likely to feed through to lower services price inflation, although this process could take time and Committee members varied in their confidence in it. Headline inflation had risen and was projected to rise slightly further in the near term, although in the baseline projection this was not expected to lead to additional second-round effects on underlying domestic inflationary pressures. The increase in headline inflation was explicable by factors such as supply issues in certain food items and changes in administered prices. However, increases in food and energy price inflation might prove salient for households&rsquo; formation of inflation expectations. As illustrated in the inflation persistence scenario set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, this could place upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Overall, the MPC judged that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures had moved slightly higher since May.</p>
<p>13: UK economic activity had remained subdued. A margin of spare capacity was estimated to have opened up, which was expected to act against some continuing inflationary persistence. There was a range of views around the extent to which it had opened and would continue to build. The labour market was continuing to loosen gradually. For some members, weak employment growth pointed to further spare capacity building. For others, potential structural changes in the labour market meant that sufficient slack might not have emerged and might not build further to weigh on inflation. Members concurred that there were generally downside risks around consumption growth in the baseline forecast and upside risks around the path of the saving ratio, including from the risk of greater precautionary saving behaviour by households.</p>
<p>14: The Committee considered Bank staff&rsquo;s latest assessment of monetary policy restrictiveness, as set out in Box A in the accompanying August Report. Reflecting the usual lags of policy, past restrictiveness was estimated to be weighing on the current level of demand, which would contribute to the disinflationary process. For those members placing greater weight on downside risks to inflation, the&nbsp;impact of past and current restrictiveness was likely to be sufficient to lean against inflationary pressures and less restrictiveness was probably required going forward. Those members who were more concerned about inflationary pressures persisting judged that a more prolonged period of policy restrictiveness was likely to be warranted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15: In considering the approach to removing remaining policy restraint at this meeting and beyond, all members were balancing various considerations. This included risks in different directions to growth and inflation, the degree of continued impact from past tightening in policy, the costs of loosening policy too quickly or too slowly, and whether and how long to wait and observe further incoming evidence before reducing Bank Rate further.</p>
<p>16: Five members preferred a reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting.</p>
<p>17: Four of these five members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. There had been sufficient progress in underlying disinflation albeit, for some of these members, with a risk that this momentum could slow. There remained greater signs of disinflation from labour market quantities and wages, than from developments in domestic prices. Activity remained weak. The pace of disinflation from here would help inform these members&rsquo; views on how quickly to remove remaining policy restraint. On the one hand, higher food prices could raise inflation expectations and generate greater inflation persistence. On the other hand, signs of weaker demand, for example as a result of the impact of continued high saving on consumption, could lead to a more rapid opening up of slack in the labour market.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk205300159"></a>18: One of these five members preferred a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. Underlying disinflation continued. Absent external shocks, domestic inflation, especially in services, was tightly linked to wages. The labour market had slack and was deteriorating further. Wage settlements had fallen to around 3.5% in the first half of 2025 and were expected to fall further in the second half. The inflation hump was expected to normalise, being dominated by one-off changes in tax and administered prices, and food inflation in a limited set of items, neither related to demand pressure. Energy futures curves were flat. With a US average tariff rate near 20%, trade diversion would slowly permeate, pushing down on inflation. UK sentiment was weak, with subdued consumption and investment. This picture was one of downside risks in coming years, namely: inflation below forecast, and activity weak or an increased risk of recession. For insurance against this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy was warranted.</p>
<p>19: Four members preferred to hold Bank Rate at 4.25% at this meeting. The disinflationary process had slowed and the risk of inflation expectations feeding through to second-round effects had risen. Business and household inflation expectations remained elevated, inflation was expected to peak at 4% and much of the recent near-term upside news in inflation had been driven by highly salient food and energy prices.&nbsp;Firms&rsquo; own-price expectations remained more sensitive to upside inflation surprises as well. These members would continue to assess the pace of disinflation, being alert to downside pressures on pricing power from domestic demand and global forces, alongside the risk of greater inflation persistence from structural changes in goods and labour markets. A slower loosening of policy would reduce the risk of inflation not meeting the target sustainably.</p>
<p>20: The Committee judged that a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The restrictiveness of monetary policy had fallen as Bank Rate had been reduced.&nbsp;The timing and pace of future reductions in the restrictiveness of policy would depend on the extent to which underlying disinflationary pressures would continue to ease. Monetary policy was not on a pre-set path, and the Committee would remain responsive to the accumulation of evidence.</p>
<p>21: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%.</li>
</ul>
<p>22: Four members voted in favour of the proposition (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden). Four members (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. One member (Alan Taylor) preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.75%.</p>
<p>23: In order to secure a majority decision on Bank Rate, the Chair invited the Committee to vote on whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be reduced by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, or Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.25%.</li>
</ul>
<p>24: Five members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. One of these members (Alan Taylor), who would otherwise have preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.5 percentage points, voted for a 0.25 percentage points reduction rather than maintaining Bank Rate. Four members (Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%.</p>
<p>25: On this basis, the MPC voted by a majority of 5&ndash;4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather than maintaining it at 4.25%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>26: On 6 August, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;586 billion.</p>
<p>27: The following members of the Committee were present:</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Sets Out Changes To Payment Safeguarding Rules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Consumers will be better protected when they use payment firms, with the introduction of new rules to protect their money from May 2026. These changes will improve safeguarding practices among payment firms.</p>
<p>Safeguarding means that customer money must be kept separate from the firm&rsquo;s own money so that it is available to be returned if the firm fails.</p>
<p>Following constructive engagement with industry, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-12-changes-safeguarding-regime-payments-and-e-money-firms" title="PS25/12: Changes to the safeguarding regime for payments and e-money firms">FCA has confirmed</a>&nbsp;that the new rules will kick in after 9 months, giving industry time to prepare. It has also made changes to ensure that rules are proportionate for smaller firms, such as by removing the requirement for audits if a firm holds less than &pound;100,000 in customer funds.</p>
<p>These rules mean that consumers are better protected, and if a payment or e-money firm fails they are more likely to get a full refund and with fewer delays.</p>
<p>The new rules require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual audits by qualified auditors.</li>
<li>Monthly reporting for payment firms.</li>
<li>Firms to conduct daily checks to make sure the right amount of money is being safeguarded to protect customers.</li>
<li>Better planning if firms fail so customers receive their money back sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules will address issues the regulator has found in previous failures of payment firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payment firms that became insolvent between Q1 2018 and Q2 2023 had average shortfalls of 65% of their customers&rsquo; funds.</p>
<p>Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets, FCA, said: 'People rely on payment firms to help manage their financial lives. But too often, when those firms fail, their customers are left out of pocket.</p>
<p>'Most of those who responded to our consultation agreed we need to raise standards to protect people&rsquo;s money and build trust, but any changes needed to be proportionate, especially for smaller firms.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;ll be watching closely to see if firms seize the opportunity and make effective improvements that their customers rightly deserve &ndash; this will help us to determine whether any further tightening of rules is necessary.'</p>

<li>The FCA will be actively supporting industry through the implementation period to help them make changes, with webinars, events and our day-to-day supervisory work.</li>
<li>Funds held by payment and e-money firms are not directly protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Instead, firms must safeguard funds which can mean customers lose money or experience delays to funds being returned if the firm fails.</li>
<li>The rules will come into effect on 7 May 2026.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>In a pioneering step toward the convergence of real estate, blockchain, and regulated digital finance, Archax, Verseprop, Spitfire Group, Daizun and the XDC Network have collectively announced the successful execution of a tokenised commercial real estate finance transaction. The companies believe this marks a significant milestone in the evolution of institutional-grade digital asset infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span>This strategic collaboration brings together several industry leaders:</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Archax, the first FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, broker, and custodian, brings deep expertise in compliant tokenised asset infrastructure and regulated capital markets access.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Verseprop, a proptech innovator transforming real estate finance and investment through tokenisation, bridges traditional real estate finance markets with next-generation digital ownership models.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Spitfire Group has been active in the collateralised lending space for many years, delivering strong, risk-adjusted returns across a range of secured finance strategies. With a focus on institutional standards and robust underwriting, Spitfire is proud to participate in this pioneering initiative, helping to bring the benefits of real estate-backed lending to a broader audience through the power of tokenisation.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span>Daizun Investments is a principal lender based in London and the South Coast, specialising in bridging and development finance for the UK property sector. They offer fast, flexible funding solutions for property investors, developers, asset managers, and SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>XDC Network is an enterprise-grade, open-source blockchain protocol. An EVM-compatible chain with smart contract capabilities, it is uniquely suited to revolutionise, decentralise, and liquify the trade finance industry through the tokenization of real-world assets and financial instruments.</span></p>
<p><span>This transaction showcases how real-world assets &ndash; specifically commercial real estate &ndash; can be digitally financed and traded using blockchain technology, unlocking new efficiencies and liquidity pathways. By combining regulatory clarity, asset-backed token issuance, and decentralised settlement layers, the initiative demonstrates the maturity and readiness of tokenised finance to scale in institutional markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Nick Donovan, CRO of Archax, commented: &ldquo;This project showcases how regulated digital asset infrastructure can be applied to real-world finance. We are pleased to support this transaction using our FCA-regulated framework and continue to lead the way in tokenised markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Joel Coren, CEO of Verseprop, added: "Our mission has always been to redefine the real estate sector, and we are doing that with institutional-grade clients and transformative projects. By tokenising commercial real estate alongside trusted partners like Archax, Spitfire Group, Daizun and XDC, we are demonstrating that real estate finance can be faster, more efficient, and significantly more cost-effective than traditional models. This is the future of real estate and the future of finance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>James Edwards, Co-Founder at Daizun Investments, added:&nbsp;&ldquo;Working with Verseprop has given us direct insight into the transformative potential of tokenised real estate finance - seamless, agile, and built for the future of the sector. This landmark transaction highlights how leading institutional partners - including Archax, Spitfire, Verseprop and XDC - are collectively reshaping the landscape of on-chain real estate funding.&nbsp;Here at Daizun, we are&nbsp;pleased to contribute to a transaction that not only aligns with our financing goals but also sets a new standard for innovation across the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kenneth Cowan, Director at XDC, said: &ldquo;The XDC Network is purpose-built for real-world asset tokenisation, and this transaction illustrates the practical utility of blockchain in institutional finance. We&rsquo;re excited to support scalable, secure tokenised finance initiatives like this one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>This landmark deal sets a precedent for how blockchain, regulatory clarity, and asset innovation can combine to deliver greater transparency, efficiency, and global access to high-value asset classes, like commercial real estate.</span></p>

<title>OTP Bank Has Joined CLSSettlement As A Settlement Member</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions across the global FX ecosystem, announced today that OTP Bank Plc. (OTP Bank), has joined CLSSettlement as a settlement member. The Hungarian credit institution is the second new settlement member to join this year, bringing the total number of settlement members to 75.</p>
<p>OTP Bank is one of the largest commercial banks in Hungary. It is part of OTP Group, a recognized leading banking group in the Central and Eastern European region that is experiencing significant growth and expansion.</p>
<p>OTP Bank joining CLSSettlement demonstrates the growing appetite among financial institutions to adopt payment-versus-payment (PvP) settlement solutions to mitigate FX settlement risk, improve operational efficiency and enhance liquidity. CLSSettlement is recognized as the global standard in FX settlement risk mitigation across 18 of the most traded currencies, with an average daily settled value of&nbsp;<b>USD7.9 trillion&nbsp;</b>in H1 2025, up&nbsp;<b>12%&nbsp;</b>year-on-year.</p>
<p>As FX markets evolve, the demand for safe and efficient settlement mechanisms continues to grow, particularly among financial institutions seeking to align with the best practices outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Lisa Danino-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer, CLS&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;OTP Bank&rsquo;s decision to become a settlement member reflects the broader trend of financial institutions focusing on mitigating FX settlement risk and increasing efficiencies delivered through multilateral netting. Multilateral netting yields significant liquidity benefits for CLS settlement members, resulting in liquidity savings of approximately 96%, enabling cash flow to be available for other business operations like trading and business growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Attila B&aacute;nfi, Managing Director of OTP Global Markets&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Mitigating FX settlement risk is a key priority for OTP Bank. Joining CLSSettlement as a settlement member reflects our dedication to creating a more robust FX ecosystem, and our commitment to adopting best practices across our risk management and middle office functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Principle 35 states,&nbsp;<i>inter alia</i>:</p>
<p>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement.</p>
<p>Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For July 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2025-202587/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2025-202587/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bilateral U.S. trade agreements concluded in mid-July 2025 with reciprocal tariffs finalized at 19 percent for Indonesia and 20 percent for Vietnam have established a major regional benchmark. This development has led to consensus among analysts that Thailand will likely secure similar terms and conditions in its tariff negotiation with the U.S. and that such an agreement will particularly benefit industries with high foreign revenue exposure. Meanwhile, the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) revised Thailand&rsquo;s 2025 GDP growth forecast from 2.1 percent to 2.2 percent. These favorable catalysts drove the SET Index to rally in July 2025 with a surge of 14.0 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> noted that the weakening Dollar Index in July 2025 drove renewed emerging market inflows across Asian equity markets as foreign funds rebalanced their portfolios. The Thai stock market particularly benefitted from compelling valuations and baht appreciation, a factor which typically attracts foreign fund inflows. The SET Index maintained its strong upward trajectory with foreign net buying recorded on 14 days out of 21 trading days in July 2025, marking the first month of foreign net buying since September 2024, with aggregate net buying of THB 16.12 billion (approx. USD493.12 million).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FPO's upward GDP revision was based on assumptions that Thailand's economic expansion would continue to be driven by private consumption, public investment, and inbound tourism, with visitor arrivals projected to reach 34.5 million. Export growth forecast was significantly upgraded to 5.5 percent from the previous 2.3 percent estimate, driven by accelerated shipments in the first half of 2025 as exporters sought to front-load deliveries to mitigate risks associated with trade wars. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted 9-2 to maintain the benchmark rate in the 4.25 &ndash; 4.5 percent range for the fifth consecutive meeting. The statement by the Federal Reserve (Fed) chair reflected elevated uncertainty over tax policies and potential impact on both inflation and U.S. labor markets, sustaining the central bank's cautious monetary policy stance. Thailand-Cambodia border disputes continue to represent regional geopolitical risk factors.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for July 2025</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2025, the SET Index surged 14.0 percent MoM to close at 1,242.35 points, significantly outpacing most regional exchanges and reducing the YTD decrease to 11.3 percent.</li>
<li>Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology, Financials, Resources, and Industrials.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value rose 12.1 percent YoY to THB 42.62 billion, with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 41.97 billion, decreasing 5.0 percent YoY. Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, accounting for 50.68 percent of July&rsquo;s total trading value which was the highest among all investor categories. They registered a net buying position of THB 16.12 billion, marking the first month of net buying since September 2024.</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of July 2025 was 13.8 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 13.0 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 14.3 times, lower than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 14.8 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of July 2025 was 3.95 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.17 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 355,290 contracts, down 19.8 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 425,984 contracts, down 11.9 percent due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>ASX Supports Strong And Effective Capital Markets In Australia</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Helen Lofthouse, ASX Managing Director and CEO commented: </b></p>
<p>&ldquo;ASX is supportive of competition that contributes to strong and effective capital markets in Australia. Our listings business, which competes with other local, regional and global exchanges, continues to offer one of the world&rsquo;s leading listing venues with more than 2,000 listed entities. We also compete with Cboe in Australia in trading and in listing exchange traded funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public markets play a critical role in supporting companies to raise capital for growth opportunities, and we&rsquo;re confident in the strong value proposition that ASX provides. We&rsquo;ve seen another example of that today with Light &amp; Wonder&rsquo;s announcement that it plans to move from a dual listing to being solely listed on ASX. This is expected in November and would make it a top 50 ASX company based on its current market capitalisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As public markets continue to grow, we remain focused on how we can continue to enhance Australia&rsquo;s position as a globally competitive, deep and liquid market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since January, ASX has welcomed 46 entities and has added $51 billion in net new capital. The increased IPO activity along with secondary capital raisings is a sign of renewed momentum in listings, and we continue to see interest from companies considering a listing.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission: Harpreet Saini Guilty Of Insider Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-harpreet-saini-guilty-of-insider-trading-202586/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-harpreet-saini-guilty-of-insider-trading-202586/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today that Harpreet Saini of Brampton has been sentenced to six months less a day in jail after pleading guilty on July 25, 2024 to insider trading pursuant to s. 76(1) of Ontario&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>.</p>
<p>As part of his sentence, the Court ordered Mr. Saini to pay a fine in the amount of $1,149,114.93 encompassing disgorgement of all his profits and an additional $100,000. He will also be subject to various trading bans for 10 years pursuant to the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>. In addition, the&nbsp;<em>Provincial Offences Act&nbsp;</em>imposes a mandatory 25% fine surcharge that brings Mr. Saini&rsquo;s overall exposure to $1,436,393.66.</p>
<p>Mr. Saini acknowledged that between May 2018 and July 2021, he accessed material non-public information through his employer, a newswire distribution network specializing in corporate press releases. Mr. Saini worked as a software developer, which allowed him to access corporate press release headlines before they were published. He then traded securities 553 times based on the headlines of 497 unpublished press releases. In total, he realized illicit gains exceeding $770,000 USD from more than 400 trades.</p>
<p>In September 2022, both Mr. Saini and a co-accused, John Natividad, were charged under the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>. The charges relating to Mr. Natividad are still before the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Employees who have access to confidential corporate information have a duty to safeguard that information and not misuse it for their personal benefit,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President, Enforcement, OSC. &ldquo;Insider trading is illegal, and it erodes investor confidence in our markets. The OSC will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to root out this type of misconduct and pursue bad actors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This case was brought by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or Court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. To do this, they often partner and collaborate with other law enforcement agencies and police forces. Charges laid under the&nbsp;<em>Securities Ac</em>t are prosecuted by the OSC. Charges laid under the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code</em>&nbsp;are prosecuted by the Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Separately, Chairman Paul S. Atkins today announced that Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda will lead the agency&rsquo;s continued efforts related to central clearing of U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is critical that the transition to clearing U.S. Treasury securities goes smoothly,&rdquo; said Chairman Atkins. &ldquo;To that end, I am pleased Commissioner Uyeda has agreed to coordinate the ongoing work being done across the SEC to prepare. Industry has raised a number of areas where the transition effort could benefit from further guidance, and today the staff made progress on providing clarification. There&rsquo;s work still to be done, both at the agency and within industry, and Commissioner Uyeda and I look forward to engaging with stakeholders to make sure we get this right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Uyeda said, &ldquo;The U.S. Treasury market plays a key role in global finance and is of central importance to our country and the world.

<p>Diana Noble, Chair of RemCo, noted that RemCo had considered and was</p>
<p>content with the Remuneration Report.</p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s external auditors, EY, presented their Audit Report to Court alongside a draft of their proposed Audit Opinion. They confirmed that subject to finalisation of a few non-material outstanding matters and receipt of the signed Letter of Representation from the Bank they would be in a position to issue an unqualified Audit Opinion.</p>
<p>Court considered the draft Report and Accounts and the supporting documentation and confirmed that the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts for 2024/2025 had been suitably prepared on a going concern basis, that the audit had been effective, and that the Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced, and understandable.</p>
<p>On this basis, Court agreed to delegate final approval of the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts to the Signing Committee, consisting of the Chair, the Governor, the PRA CEO, the CFO and the EY Auditors.</p>

<title>July 2025 Figures At Eurex</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/july-2025-figures-at-eurex-202586/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/july-2025-figures-at-eurex-202586/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Eurex trading volumes dip by 10 percent amid calmer markets in July.</li>
<li>OTC Clearing sees strong 28 percent growth in notional outstanding volumes.</li>
<li>Eurex Repo posts solid growth in July, GC Pooling surges 19 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurex &mdash; Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s leading central counterparties &mdash; saw trading volumes decline in July, reflecting more subdued market conditions. The exchange reported a total of 138.9 million contracts traded during the month &mdash; a 10 percent drop compared to the 154.3 million recorded in July last year. Despite the overall decrease, interest rate derivatives showed resilience, rising by 10 percent year-on-year to reach 75.4 million contracts. In contrast, equity derivatives trading fell by 19 percent to 18.6 million contracts. Index derivatives also saw a decline, with volumes dropping 30 percent to 44.3 million contracts.</p>
<p>OTC Clearing recorded a notable increase in July, with notional outstanding volumes climbing by 28 percent compared to July 2024. Total volumes reached EUR 45,770 billion, up from EUR 35,789 billion during the same period in 2024. Overnight index swaps led the surge, posting a 57 percent rise to EUR 5,901 billion. Interest rate swaps also contributed significantly, growing by 26 percent to EUR 19,207 billion.</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, reported a 4 percent increase in average term-adjusted volumes for July 2025, reaching EUR 388.0 billion. The growth was largely driven by strong performance in the GC Pooling segment, which jumped 19 percent compared to the same period last year. In contrast, the Repo Market segment saw a 9 percent decline. Despite contrasting trends across segments, Eurex Repo maintained upward momentum with a 3 percent year-on-year increase in volumes through July.</p>

<title>The EBA Issues A No-Action Letter On The Application Of ESG Disclosure Requirements And Updates The EBA ESG Risks Dashboard With December 2024 Data</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-issues-a-no-action-letter-on-the-application-of-esg-disclosure-requireme-202586/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-issues-a-no-action-letter-on-the-application-of-esg-disclosure-requireme-202586/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a no-action letter on the application of the ESG Pillar 3 disclosure requirements under the EBA disclosure Implementing Technical Standards (ITS). This no-action letter aims to address legal and operational uncertainties linked to the evolving ESG disclosure framework, in light of the proposed amendments under the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/omnibus-package-2025-04-01_en"><span>European Commission&rsquo;s Omnibus legislative package on sustainability reporting</span></a><span>. The EBA is also updating its ESG risk dashboard.</span></p>
<p>This no-action letter formalises the guidance already provided in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-launches-consultation-amended-disclosure-requirements-esg-risks-equity-exposures-and-aggregate">EBA&rsquo;s Consultation Paper published in May 2025</a>&nbsp;on the amending ITS of the EBA Pillar 3 disclosure framework. In particular, it includes the following recommendations to competent authorities until the EBA amending ITS included in the Consultation Paper enter into force:</p>
<ul>
<li>To not prioritise the enforcement of the disclosure of certain ESG disclosure templates (notably EU 6 to EU 10, and specific columns in Templates 1 and 4) of the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/3172/oj/eng">Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3172</a>, for large institutions with listed securities;</li>
<li>To not prioritise the enforcement of the collection of templates EU 6 to 10, and specific columns in Templates 1 and 4 of the EBA Decision&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/1061127/EBA%20DC%20498%20-%20Decision%20on%20institutions%20ESG%20data%20adhoc%20collection.pdf">EBA/DC/498 of 6 July 2023</a>, for large institutions with listed securities;</li>
<li>To not prioritise the enforcement of the disclosure of the corresponding ESG templates under the Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3172 for all other institutions recently brought under the scope of Article 449a of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The EBA remains committed to delivering a coherent and streamlined ESG disclosure framework and will continue to work closely with EU institutions and stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation of the new requirements.</p>
<p>The EBA is also publishing today an updated version of the&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.eba.europa.eu/interactive-tools/2025/powerbi/ESG_dashboard_page%201.html"><span>EBA ESG risk dashboard</span></a>. The ESG risk landscape across EU/EEA banks appears stable, thus reflecting the long-term horizon of climate-related risks and the gradual pace of change in banking portfolios.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the content of the ESG risk dashboard will be adjusted in the next editions in line with the no-action letter, and the recommendations to authorities not to prioritise the enforcement of the disclosure of those specific templates and information.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The non-action letter has been drafted in accordance with Article 9c of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-no-action-letter-application-esg-disclosure-requirements-and-updates-eba-esg-risks#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;(EBA founding Regulation), which gives the EBA the power to issue no-action letters, if it considers that the application of one of the relevant legislative acts is liable to raise significant issues. This is the case when provisions contained in such act may directly conflict with another relevant act, and if based on some relevant information, the EBA considers that the application of the relevant provisions raises significant exceptional issues in terms of market confidence,&nbsp; customer or investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets, or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system in the Union.</p>
<p>Article 434a of the CRR mandates the EBA to develop ITS to specify uniform disclosure formats and accompanying IT solutions.</p>
<p>Article 449a of the CRR, as introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (CRR2), required large institutions with securities admitted to trading on a regulated market in a Member State to disclose their exposures to ESG risks. These requirements were further operationalised through the Commission&rsquo;s Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3172, which sets out detailed ITS for ESG disclosures.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) 2024/1624 (CRR3) amended Article 449a, expanding the scope of ESG disclosures to all institutions. These revised obligations apply from 1 January 2025.</p>
