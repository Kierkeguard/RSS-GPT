<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>360T, a best-in-class global Foreign Exchange (FX) trading platform and technology provider, and Quantitative Brokers (QB), a leading provider of advanced execution algorithms and data-driven analytics, have announced a partnership that will make QB&rsquo;s newly launched suite of FX algos available via 360T.</p>
<p>Both 360T and QB are part of the Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group.</p>
<p>Since QB was launched in 2008, the firm has become widely recognised as the market-leading provider of independent algos and analytics in the Futures, US Cash Treasury and Options markets due to a combination of its specialist engineering expertise, deep understanding of market microstructure and research-focused culture.</p>
<p>In response to client demand, QB and 360T have partnered to bring QB's proven execution expertise to the Spot FX market. This expansion introduces FX-optimised versions of its flagship algorithms, &ldquo;Bolt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strobe&rdquo;, designed specifically to account for the unique market structure and liquidity dynamics of FX trading. Strobe FX enhances schedule-based execution for TWAP and VWAP benchmarks, while Bolt FX is an implementation shortfall algorithm built to minimise execution costs relative to arrival price.</p>
<p>These FX capabilities are now available via 360T&rsquo;s platform, enabling users to deploy them across highly curated disclosed or anonymous liquidity pools, putting multiple counterparties in competition to help ensure best execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to announce this partnership with QB and are confident that providing access to highly sophisticated FX algos from an independent specialist provider, as additional tools alongside the broad range of bank offered algos already available via 360T, will provide significant benefits to our diverse and global client base,&rdquo; said Matt O&rsquo;Hara, CEO of 360T Americas.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;This partnership also delivers on Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s strategic vision to bring together highly complementary technology solutions from independently operating providers within the organisation to create a truly differentiated offering and further accelerate growth, while also fully aligning with 360T&rsquo;s commitment to constant innovation in FX.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Quantitative Brokers is deeply committed to delivering enhanced value to our clients while expanding our reach to a broader spectrum of market participants. We are thrilled to bring our extensive expertise and proven track record in developing state-of-the-art execution algorithms to the FX market at a time when demand for such solutions is growing rapidly. Partnering with 360T&mdash;a world-class FX trading platform and a member of the Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&mdash;was a natural and strategic step in this journey," said David Kalita, CEO of QB.</p>
<p>He added: "As an independent provider with a strong history of delivering high-performance execution tools and analytics, we are confident that QB&rsquo;s suite of innovative FX algos will empower market participants to optimise their trading strategies and achieve superior outcomes."</p>

<title>The Complex Challenge Of Advice - Speech By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Conexus Financial Professional Planner 2025 Advice Policy Summit, 10 February 2025.</title>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Financial advisers are entrusted by their clients to help them make confident and informed decisions. In many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</span></li>
<li><span>ASIC has observed some positive signs of improvement &ndash; but there continues to be too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers</span>.</li>
<li><span>In light of some of these poor practices, &lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo; and &lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo; have been selected as 2025 enforcement priorities</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning everyone.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal people as the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we are gathering today &ndash; and by paying my respects to their elders past, present and emerging and extending that respect to any First Nations people with us here today.</p>
<p>One of ASIC&rsquo;s core functions is to promote the confident and informed participation of consumers and investors in our financial system &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why I was pleased to accept this invitation to speak at this Advice Policy Summit.</p>
<p>Not everybody needs or seeks advice to support their participation in the financial system. But when they do, it&rsquo;s important that they have access to good quality advice that meets their needs and is delivered with independence and integrity.</p>
<p>While that&rsquo;s a simple objective, achieving it is not easy.</p>
<p>As is clear from ASIC&rsquo;s work over many years, the complexity of the financial system, the range of products and business models, the interconnected nature of some of those, and indeed the range of knowledge and capacity that people bring when they engage with the system, make consumer protection and financial advice a complex challenge.</p>
<p>Sometimes this results in very complex legislation, as I know you&rsquo;re all aware of. And sometimes that is helpful. But we&rsquo;re also increasingly conscious that sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>Complexity can often be an obstacle to compliance, and to effective regulation. In our experience, the simpler a set of rules, the more enforceable they are. That&rsquo;s not just good for consumers and investors. It&rsquo;s also good for businesses and professionals, who get greater clarity about what&rsquo;s required of them.</p>
<p>And while the legislative framework is a matter for the Government, we&lsquo;re conscious that we administer a complex range of regulatory guidance and legislative instruments. With a significant amount of that focusing on the requirements that apply to people involved in the provision of financial advice.</p>
<p>In November last year, our Chair Joe Longo announced the creation of a Simplification Consultative Group, to advise ASIC on what we can do, within our powers, to address this issue of complexity. We will be seeking your views on this work during 2025. So if it&rsquo;s an issue of interest to you, I encourage you to keep an eye out for further announcements in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But returning to the topic of today&rsquo;s forum, advice policy, I&rsquo;d like to start by talking about ASIC&rsquo;s role in policy &ndash; in general and also in relation to the advice-related reforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll then share some reflections on what we are seeing in terms of the quality of advice.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll finish with some notes on what you can expect to see from ASIC over the next year, given our priorities.</p>
<h2>Policy: preparation, implementation and compliance</h2>
<p>So, first to ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to policy.</p>
<p>ASIC doesn&rsquo;t make policy decisions. Nor do we design regulatory reform. That&rsquo;s the role of the Government, guided by advice from Treasury, with Parliament, of course, making the ultimate decision on any changes to legislation.</p>
<p>ASIC does, of course, assist Treasury through that process. But our role really comes into play once legislative reforms have passed, where we&rsquo;ve got an important role in helping industry to understand what the new requirements mean for them, and how to comply with them. And, obviously, a key way in which we do this is through producing regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>The Delivering Better Financial Outcomes (DBFO) reforms provide the most recent examples of this work. As you know, and we&rsquo;ve already talked about this morning, it&rsquo;s being rolled out in a series of tranches. And through this process, we&rsquo;ve been liaising with industry &ndash; through various professional associations, through our supervisory work and stakeholder forums, including our own Financial Adviser Consultative Panel.</p>
<p>Coming from that work, in October and November we released &ndash; following the passage of the first tranche &ndash; a suite of new and updated regulatory guidance and other supporting information. And we continue to seek input from stakeholders on the content of our regulatory guidance, some of which may result in further updates to that guidance. And as further reforms are legislated, we&rsquo;ll continue through that process.</p>
<p>Similarly, with the introduction of professional standards for financial advisers, we continue to update our guidance &ndash; and we&rsquo;ll no doubt be doing that further as a result of some announcements earlier today. This, to date, includes information about the impact of the reforms, timeframes for compliance and the requirements for accessing different pathways.</p>
<p>As reforms begin to take effect, industry participants sometimes encounter practical issues that are raised with us, often by industry groups. We&rsquo;re always really keen to listen to those concerns and, where it&rsquo;s appropriate and within our powers, we&rsquo;re willing to consider taking action to support the intent of the relevant reforms.</p>
<p>As an example, following industry concerns about the practical implications of the changes to Financial Services Guide (FSG) requirements, we registered a legislative instrument late last year, which broadened the use of website disclosure. So that it can be used in relation to dealing in a financial product for the purposes of implementing financial product advice, as well as for the advice itself. And I know that was something that was welcomed by many around the industry.</p>
<p>Of course, once legislation is in place, we also then shift focus to monitoring compliance &ndash; and one of the key ways in which we do that is through thematic reviews.</p>
<p>These typically involve selecting a selection of advisers and licensees, gathering data and information to help us to assess levels of compliance with particular legislative provisions. We then publish our findings, highlighting good practices and areas for improvement to assist the sector and drive further compliance.</p>
<p>And a good example of this from the past year would be Report 779, which examined the role of super trustees, financial advisers and licensees in relation to choice superannuation products &ndash; which I discussed at another Conexus event late last year which I know a number of you were present at [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>].</p>
<p>Then the other key aspect of our role is, of course, enforcement. Where we see serious non-compliance &ndash; which might be something we identify through our thematic reviews, it might be through reportable situations, it might be through reports of misconduct that come directly to us from members of the public &ndash; we may refer that misconduct for investigation, which can, of course, lead to litigation by ASIC or referral to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for potential prosecution.</p>
<p>We provide clear guidance to industry about our priorities, the areas of focus in our enforcement work, through annual enforcement priorities, which I&rsquo;ll discuss a bit later.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s view on the quality of advice</h2>
<p>Before speaking about our priorities for the next year, Conexus invited me to make a few comments about what we&rsquo;re seeing in terms of the quality of advice and whether it&rsquo;s improved, given the reforms of recent years.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, we&rsquo;ve seen some positive indications through work that ASIC has done. That includes the work that we did on the Life Insurance Framework Review, where we saw a significant improvement in the quality of advice between 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>And although the scope and findings of that work were limited to life insurance advice, some of our observations from the review and input from industry stakeholders suggest that several factors have influenced an improvement in standards of advice in parts of the industry.</p>
<p>They, of course, include the adviser education standards and improved focus by licensees on the best interests duty, and the adoption of some of the recommendations that we made in 2017, following a review of how large institutions were overseeing advisers [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-515-financial-advice-review-of-how-large-institutions-oversee-their-advisers/" title="REP 515 Financial advice: Review of how large institutions oversee their advisers">REP 515</a>].</p>
<p>We also observed, in that work, that record-keeping across client advice files had materially improved. And that&rsquo;s important because record-keeping helps demonstrate compliance, and it&rsquo;s long been an area of focus for ASIC and will continue to be so.</p>
<h2>Areas of concern</h2>
<p>At the same time, however, we continue to see too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers.</p>
<p>Our ongoing investigation into the Shield Master Fund is one such example &ndash; though regrettably it&rsquo;s not an isolated one. It reflects a pattern of conduct we are seeing all too frequently.</p>
<p>This pattern commonly involves telemarketers recruiting consumers before passing them onto advisers. These advisers then recommend that consumers withdraw their superannuation savings from a regulated fund and invest them, sometimes via an SMSF (self-managed super fund), into a high-risk property scheme or some other high-risk investment.</p>
<p>Our Deputy Chair Sarah Court has described some of this misconduct as occurring &lsquo;at industrial scale&rsquo;. And this can result in the significant erosion &ndash; or complete loss &ndash; of a person&rsquo;s retirement savings. And while there is often a complex web of individuals and entities involved, inappropriate or poor-quality advice typically plays a pivotal role in the ultimate consumer outcomes.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s priorities</h2>
<p>Those comments are a bit of a backdrop to some of our priorities for the current year, which I&rsquo;ll talk about now. I&rsquo;ll talk about our strategic priorities and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>We have five longer-term&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/our-role/our-vision-and-strategic-priorities/" title="Our vision and strategic priorities">strategic priorities</a>&nbsp;but there are two in particular that I&rsquo;ll call out as having an impact on advice.</p>
<p>The first is to&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;improve consumer outcomes&rsquo;</strong>. And this includes our work in a range of areas, such as predatory sales tactics, design and distribution obligations and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>And I would like to particularly highlight the work on dispute resolution. We, of course, now receive data on a six-monthly basis on firms&rsquo; internal dispute resolution. We have made it clear that we will be publishing firm-level data from that data collection during the course of 2025.</p>
<p>Late last year, we published a higher-level overview of what we were seeing from the initial data collection, with some observations around some of the data quality issues. And, I guess, I mention that because with firm-level publication coming, firms have got an opportunity to really focus on how to improve the quality of their data before that becomes publicly available.</p>
<p>The second strategic priority to highlight is&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;better retirement outcomes and member services&rsquo;</strong>. And while this includes our well-publicised work on member services for members of super funds, our work in this area is not limited to super. It also includes a focus on entities and individuals involved in the provision of advice.</p>
<p>An important initiative in this area is our thematic review into self-managed super fund establishment advice, which is focusing on why some clients are advised to set up an SMSF.</p>
<p>As part of this, we&rsquo;re reviewing client advice files, where SMSF establishment advice was provided, to assess compliance with the best interests duty and related obligations. We&rsquo;re also reviewing information from licensees about their oversight and the application of their policies and procedures in the context of SMSF establishment advice. And I expect that we&rsquo;ll release the findings from this work in the second half of this calendar year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, besides our strategic priorities, we also have&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">enforcement priorities</a>, which are announced annually. And these target specific forms of misconduct that are of serious concern to ASIC.</p>
<p>Over the coming year, you can expect, through those priorities, to see a sustained focus on advice-related misconduct.</p>
<p>In light of some of the poor practices we&rsquo;re seeing, which I&rsquo;ve spoken about, the 2025 priorities include&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>And I want to say, our work in this area won&rsquo;t be limited to superannuation trustees or responsible entities of managed investment schemes. It will include the broad range of entities involved in conduct causing harm to consumers and investors &ndash; including advisers and licensees.</p>
<p>And the final thing I want to say is those enforcement priorities are set in a context in which our investment in enforcement and our appetite for taking on significant matters are increasing.</p>
<p>We currently have action underway against NAB, HSBC, the ASX, Harvey Norman, QBE and Rex. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the trial of former directors and officers of the Star Entertainment Group, which is commencing today. The number of investigations that we commenced in the last six months of 2024 was up more than 30%, year-on-year, and some of these will flow through into future litigation and compliance action.</p>
<p>And I really hope that this stronger approach to enforcement is something that&rsquo;s welcomed by people in this room. Because when advice goes terribly wrong, the harm that it causes to consumers can damage confidence in the entire industry.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I wanted to say by way of intro. Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, one of our core functions is to promote the informed participation of consumers and investors in the system.</p>
<p>Your clients trust you to help them make confident and informed decisions &ndash; and, in many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</p>
<p>So, I hope that these comments give you confidence that ASIC is committed to continuing to work with you to help you to comply with the law in ways that produce good outcomes for consumers. Thank you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Directional Equity Hedge extends strong 2024 to lead broad-based HFRI Composite gains</li>
<li>Shareholder Activist, Fundamental, Quantitative lead sub-strategy performance</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge funds gained in January to begin 2025 navigating a volatile month highlighted the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US President, confirmation procedures of key appointed Cabinet positions, and a wide range of executive orders implementing policy changes across a number of areas including immigration, trade/tariffs, energy policy and spending reductions. In addition to this, managers also navigated a volatile month in the technology sector, with earnings, capital expenditures and strategic outlooks impacted by intense competition in the AI space driven by the Chinese startup Deepseek.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite gained +1.4 percent for the month, led by the directional HFRI Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +2.1 percent. The HFR Cryptocurrency Index extended its 2024 surge, adding +0.36 percent in January on the favorable outlook for cryptocurrency by the incoming Trump administration. The recently launched HFRI Multi-Manager/Pod Shop Index advanced +1.9 percent for the month as managers navigated policies from the new administration, as well as Technology volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge fund performance dispersion contracted slightly in January, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.9 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 12.0 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in December 2024 was 13.2 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending January 2025, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +41.4 percent, while the bottom decile declined -9.9 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 51.3 percent. Nearly eighty percent (80%) of hedge funds produced positive performance in January.</span></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="m_-9209425515007766492__Hlk189820723"><b><span lang="EN-US">HFR continues to expand index offerings, launches indices delineated by fund liquidity</span></b></a><span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">HFR unveiled an expansion of its HFRI, HFRI 500 and HFRI 400 index families, launching new indices delineated by fund liquidity. The new composite and strategy-level indices are split into two liquidity categories: one for funds with monthly (or more frequent) liquidity, the other comprised of funds offering less than monthly liquidity (quarterly, etc.). The purpose of the new indices is to empower investors by offering hedge fund benchmarks that more closely resemble the liquidity characteristics of their underlying hedge fund or other alternative asset portfolios.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge continues to lead main strategy performance</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, extended 2024 leadership with a strong gain to begin 2025 while navigating both new policy and technology sector volatility, with the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index advancing +2.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index, which surged +3.6 percent for the month, the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, which jumped +2.8 percent, and the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which added +1.65 percent in January.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Uncorrelated Macro strategies also advanced in January to begin 2025 as interest rates fell while commodities gained, with the HFRI Macro (Total) Index adding +1.0 percent in January, while the HFRI Macro Asset Weighted gained +2.0 percent. Macro sub-strategy performance was led by the HFRI Macro: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.5 percent, and the HFRI Macro: Discretionary Thematic Index, which added +1.6 percent for the month.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also gained in January as recent policy changes have increased expectations for a strong M&amp;A cycle in 2025. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index advanced +0.9 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Activist Index, which jumped +2.4 percent, and the HFRI ED: Credit Arbitrage Index, which added +1.95 percent in January.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies produced another gain as interest rates declined despite significant gains in the US Dollar, with the HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index gaining an estimated +0.8 percent for the month marking the Index 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;consecutive monthly gain and 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;gain in last 30 months. RVA strategy performance was led by the HFRI RV: FI-Convertible Arbitrage Index, which advanced +1.3 percent for the month, followed closely by the HFRI RV: Multi-Strategy Index, which added +1.2 percent.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies also gained in January, with the HFRX Market Directional Index gaining +2.35 percent while the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index advanced +1.0 percent. Strategy gains were led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which gained +2.1 percent.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&ldquo;Hedge funds posted gains to begin 2025, effectively navigating a challenging environment dominated by volatility in the technology sector, as well as announcements of executive orders and implementation of new policies effecting a wide range of industries including trade/tariffs, immigration, energy and many others. Despite the volatility, directional Equity Hedge strategies led broad-based strategy gains for the month, with contributions from Fundamental, Quantitative and Shareholder Activist sub-strategy exposures,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;Many financial market risks have shifted and evolved but not fallen, with geopolitical risk shifting from election outcomes and military conflicts to policy changes and conflict resolution; inflation and interest rate risks remain, while expectations for continued growth in AI-fueled large cap technology are in some cases tempered by high capital expenditures and intense global competition. Managers have been positioning for this dynamic environment for several months, with intensive positioning since the US election in November, and it is likely that managers are positioned for acceleration of these policy changes throughout 1H25. Investors are likely to increase allocations to managers which have effectively demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s specialized ability to navigate these policy changes and rapidly shifting market cycles which create both risk and opportunities.&rdquo;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided a temporary exemption from compliance with Rule 13f-2 under the Securities Exchange Act and from reporting on Form SHO. As a result of the exemption, filings on initial Form SHO reports from institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds will be due by Feb. 17, 2026, for the January 2026 reporting period. The effective date for Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO was Jan. 2, 2024, and the compliance date for such rule and form was Jan. 2, 2025, with initial Form SHO filings originally due by Feb. 14, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 requires institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds to file Form SHO with the Commission within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month with regard to certain equity securities via the Commission&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR). The Commission will publish, on an aggregated basis, certain information regarding each equity security reported by institutional investment managers on Form SHO and filed with the Commission via EDGAR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. &ldquo;This exemption gives filers more time to implement the technical updates required for compliance according to standards that were released only on Dec. 16, 2024, immediately prior to the holidays. Regardless of this exemption, abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful, and the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exemption will provide industry participants sufficient time to work with Commission staff to address any outstanding operational and compliance questions. This exemption will also provide filers sufficient time to complete implementation of system builds and testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency is essential to well-functioning markets. And the Commission has stated the importance of providing more disclosure about short selling. It is also important to enhance the accuracy of the short sale-related data that would ultimately be provided to investors by giving institutional investment managers additional time.</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO reporting will enhance the transparency of other available short sale-related information. Currently, several self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are providing on their websites daily aggregate short selling volume information for individual equity securities. The SROs are also providing website disclosure on a one-month delayed basis of information regarding individual short sale transactions in all exchange-listed equity securities. Hyperlinks to short sale data&nbsp;provided by specific SROs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/short-sale-volume-and-transaction-data">are available</a>. Further, the SROs are also publishing monthly statistics on short interest in securities that trade on their markets.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/fails-deliver-data">publishes on its website</a>&nbsp;failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month.</p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the appointment of Rodney E. Hood as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, effective February 10, 2025. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent designated Mr. Hood pursuant to his authority in 12 U.S.C. 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful for the trust of Secretary Bessent and will work diligently to promote a regulatory environment that is effective without being excessive,&rdquo; said Mr. Hood. &ldquo;I remain committed to a balanced framework&mdash;one that fosters innovation, expands financial inclusion, and ensures that all Americans have fair access to the financial services they need to thrive. I look forward to leading the dedicated career staff at the OCC, whose expertise and commitment are essential to maintaining a safe and sound banking system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hood succeeds Acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu, who has served in the role since May 10, 2021.</p>
<p>"I thank Mr. Hsu for his many years of dedicated public service and his commitment to strengthening the resilience of the U.S. banking system," said Mr. Hood.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent today announced his intention to appoint Rodney E. Hood as a Deputy Comptroller and to designate him the First Deputy Comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In this role, Mr. Hood will also serve as Acting Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong leadership and career experience of Rodney Hood will strengthen the OCC&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system while also enhancing economic growth," said Secretary Bessent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain steadfastly committed to serving the American people and the banking system by creating a regulatory structure that fulfills our obligations, fosters innovation, and promotes financial inclusion, including those Americans who have been debanked and underserved,&rdquo; said Mr. Hood.</p>
<p>The OCC is a bureau within the Department of the Treasury, and the Comptroller of the Currency is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. By statute (12 U.S.C. &sect; 4), the Treasury Secretary is responsible for appointing up to four Deputy Comptrollers of the Currency and designating one as the First Deputy Comptroller. During a vacancy in the position of Comptroller, the First Deputy Comptroller possesses the powers and performs the duties of the office of Comptroller.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is such a pleasure to be back in Miami, a city I have seen grow and become ever more dynamic over the decades, as I have come many times to visit my large extended family here ever since the 1980s.</p>
<p>As I discussed in my final speech of 2024, two positive supply shocks have significantly benefited the U.S. economy over the past two years and have also affected the conduct of monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The first of these has been the surge in population over the past few years that has helped bring labor supply into balance with labor demand and, thus, also helped move inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. The other positive supply shock, which I outlined in my remarks in December, has been a step-up in aggregate productivity growth since 2020, which is an increase in the amount of economic output, across the economy, per hour worked or some other unit of labor. Although productivity growth, measured quarterly, can be quite volatile, over the past five years this acceleration is quite evident. While productivity grew by about 1.5 percent a year from 2005 to 2019, starting in 2020 it has grown about 2 percent a year. This difference may not look dramatic, but because of compounding year-over-year, the consequences of an additional 1/2 percentage point in growth over the past five years are significant for workers and the U.S. economy. When workers are more productive, it effectively means that businesses can produce more without needing to add workers, and that they can pay workers more without needing to raise prices. When they are more productive, it can also serve as an incentive for businesses to expand. Across the economy, higher productivity growth means that real wages and living standards for workers can rise faster without putting upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what has been happening recently, a period when inflation has been falling while the economy is expanding. While fast growth in wages was one of the factors driving inflation in 2021 and 2022, most likely some of that increase was due to productivity growth and, hence, was not inflationary. If productivity continues to grow at an accelerated pace, it would support the FOMC's efforts to keep unemployment low and return inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to spend the balance of my remarks exploring some of the possible reasons why productivity has accelerated, and the prospects that this fortunate development will continue.</p>
<p>Numerous factors affect aggregate productivity, and several may have driven the increase in productivity growth in the U.S. since the pandemic, in contrast to the subdued productivity growth experienced by other advanced economies around the world.</p>
<p>One such factor may have been a result of the enormous movement of workers caused by the pandemic. It began with the dramatic loss of 22 million jobs in the spring of 2020, the reemployment of many of those workers and the continued mobility as people quit jobs, switched occupations and careers, and relocated in response to the enormous changes in work and home life brought about by the pandemic. In finding new jobs, in what became a very tight labor market, workers had the opportunity to find better matches for their skills and, to some extent, work that they were motivated to carry out and which made them more productive. One indication that this was probably a significant factor in the U.S. is that other advanced economies where there was less worker movement have experienced lower rates of productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Economic data and research suggest that periods of strong job re-allocation are accompanied or followed by higher productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>The tightness of the labor market since 2021 has also likely led firms to invest to a greater extent in labor-saving as well as labor-enhancing technologies, which, of course, is traditionally one of the major sources of productivity gains. For example, many retail businesses seemed to have installed more self-checkout machines after the onset of the pandemic, allowing employers to substitute capital for workers when workers could not come to work in person and when there were severe shortages. More generally, digital technology allowed employees to continue working from home during the period of the pandemic and beyond, saving commuting time and making employees potentially more productive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>To the extent that these factors are boosting productivity growth, they are by their nature one-off developments that eventually will fade. A notable exception may turn out to be productivity improvements from investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI investment by businesses has stepped up in the past two years, and it appears to be accelerating.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The advent of the internet and related innovations boosted productivity growth for about 10 years starting in the mid-1990s, and the benefits of AI could potentially be that revolutionary and persistent.</p>
<p>In addition to being temporary, the factors that I have outlined that could be boosting productivity, job re-allocation, and technological investments are themselves hard to measure across the economy. And so are their effects on productivity as well. But there is another important factor that is likely to be driving productivity higher whose effects may well persist, and that is the surge in new business formation experienced since 2019. As I will explain, new businesses are associated with higher rates of overall productivity growth, and that may be particularly true for some of the sectors in which these businesses were created.</p>
<p>Applications for new business tax identification numbers jumped shortly after the pandemic began and have remained elevated since then.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In 2024, the pace of applications that are likely to result in employer business formation was about 30 percent above its 2019 pace. This surge is largely unique to the U.S. In the euro zone, for example, business registrations have been relatively flat. This may help explain why labor productivity growth in Europe has been well below that of the U.S. in recent years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The surge in applications in early 2020 was an early signal of an acceleration in the creation of job-creating new firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The latest data available indicate that new firms created 1.9 million jobs in 2023, 14 percent higher than the total for 2019.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A couple of aspects of this surge in business entry in the U.S. are noteworthy. First, the surge was particularly noticeable in high-tech industries that, historically, are important for overall innovation and productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Second, while the pace of business applications has cooled somewhat over the past year, it still remains elevated and well above pre-pandemic norms. It is, in fact, proving somewhat more persistent than some expected.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the surge in new business formation is highly relevant to our discussion about productivity. There is a large body of research that finds that new firms are key contributors to innovation and growth in aggregate productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a><span>&nbsp;</span>This might seem surprising and counterintuitive, since it is well known that many new firms fail in their first year or two. But in the commotion of competition that these many new businesses face, there are always businesses that persist and keep their lights on, and those often do so because they are innovative and more productive. New businesses are the essence of the competition that drives market-based economies, and it is not surprising that they would be an important source of new products or processes for doing business&mdash;and a source of growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Of course, not every new firm has to innovate and grow to make important economic contributions. Every entrepreneur contributes even if they just create a job for themselves and their family members. But those new firms that do innovate and grow are critical for improvements in overall productivity over time.</p>
<p>As I noted before, since the surge in entrepreneurship after the onset of the pandemic featured an increase in high-tech businesses as well, the productivity implications could be significant. Indeed, the last period of strong productivity growth in the U.S., which ran from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, was preceded by a surge of new business creation in high-tech industries, including those industries that more recently have been associated with AI-related developments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;So this is one source of my optimism about continued robust productivity growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>But it is not only the innovations produced directly by new businesses that are important, since by any measure these new firms are a small share of total businesses. New businesses also help drive innovation by existing firms. As they scramble for funding, customers, and human capital, new businesses will increase competition with existing ones, forcing them to innovate as well so they can succeed. This is surely also driving the recent acceleration in productivity growth.</p>
<p>Many predicted that the surge in new business creation would disappear as effects of the pandemic have faded, but this has not really happened. It is possible that the surge in entry will recede and that its productivity effects will likewise be temporary. On the other hand, the productivity gains from a surge in entry could last for some time, since these highly productive young firms have been found to grow rapidly for several years, contributing to aggregate productivity growth along the way. Time will tell, but for now, it seems likely that this is a factor supporting productivity growth at a higher-than-historical rate.</p>
<p>I will confess to you all that it is not a coincidence that I have come to Miami to highlight the role of entrepreneurship in innovation and productivity growth. Miami and the Miami metropolitan area is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial area, a place with high rates of new business creation, and it is likely an important source of the recent productivity surge.</p>
<p>Out of more than 900 U.S. cities for which we have data, Miami's post-pandemic new firm entry rate ranked 8th in the nation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;And Miami is not alone in Florida; 5 of the top 20 cities for pandemic-era business formation are here in your state.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Miami specifically, and Florida generally, has been a key part of the U.S. entrepreneurship story for some time. During the decade before the pandemic, Miami ranked 5th out of more than 900 U.S. cities for firm entry rates, and Florida featured 8 of the top 20 U.S. cities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Miami is special in this regard. I wonder what is in the water here to produce such a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Perhaps it is the extent of sunshine, which has long been associated with optimism. Perhaps it is the friendly economic climate&mdash;in my own academic research, I have found that policies that facilitate business entry and support worker or job re-allocation are indeed helpful for dynamism and productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;But an interesting question for me as the first Hispanic at the Board of Governors since its creation is whether the large Hispanic population in Florida is also a factor behind the impressive pace of business dynamism that I have just described.</p>
<p>More than 25 percent of Florida's population is Hispanic, compared with around 20 percent for the United States as a whole.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Nationwide, recent data indicate that Latinos account for a dominant&mdash;and rapidly growing&mdash;share of new entrepreneurship in the U.S., with a particular increase since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Of course, many of these Latino entrepreneurs are also immigrants, another group with a well-known proclivity for entrepreneurship.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;There are immigrants in Miami from the Caribbean and all over the world who contribute to the entrepreneurial culture of this city, and it is surely this culture, as much as the efforts of any nationality or group, that is the real engine of the dynamism here. I applaud you all for fostering that culture here in Florida, which is such an important contributor to the economic growth of our nation. More entrepreneurs means more productivity, which is crucial to U.S. prosperity.</p>
<p>Let me conclude with an outline of my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and the FOMC's efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a strong labor market.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy remains on a firm footing.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) continues to grow at a solid pace. The Bureau for Economic Analysis estimates that real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, and private domestic final purchases, which is the best indicator for GDP one quarter ahead, grew a solid 3.2 percent. Therefore, I anticipate solid GDP growth also in the first quarter of this year. In addition, earlier today the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers created 143,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged down to 4 percent, consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.</p>
<p>Inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, and in September the FOMC judged that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels intended to strongly restrict aggregate demand and put downward pressure on inflation. We reduced our policy rate 100 basis points through December, but the recent progress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated. There is also considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of proposals of new policies. Going forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
