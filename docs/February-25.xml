<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a consent order against&nbsp;<strong>Randall Crater</strong>&nbsp;of Heathrow, Florida.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The order requires Crater to pay over $</span><span>7.6 million&nbsp;</span><span>in restitution to defrauded victims in connection with his digital asset fraud scheme, with dollar-for-dollar credit for restitution payments to victims in satisfaction of the restitution ordered in a parallel criminal action. The order also imposes a permanent injunction against Crater and bans him from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets, entering into any transactions involving commodity interests or digital asset commodities, and registering with the CFTC.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The consent order finds from at least January 2014 through January 2018, Crater, together with other defendants named in CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint, operated a digital asset scheme in which they fraudulently offered the sale of a fully functioning virtual currency,&nbsp;<strong>My Big Coin</strong>, a commodity in interstate commerce.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Crater obtained more than $7.6 million from at least 28 customers through fraudulent solicitations, including false and misleading claims and omissions about MBC&rsquo;s value, use and trade status, and that MBC was backed by gold. He spent the misappropriated money to purchase, among other things, a home, antiques, fine art, jewelry, and other luxury goods.</span></p>
<p><span>The consent order resolves the claims against Crater in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against him and co-defendants&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Mark Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., John Roche, and Michael Kruger</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;[See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7678-18"><span>7678-18</span></a><span>.] The enforcement action remains pending against the co-defendants.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>On Jan. 18, 2022, a grand jury returned an eight-count superseding indictment charging Crater with wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business based on the same conduct alleged in CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint. [</span><em><span>United States v. Randall Crater</span></em><span>, No. 1:19-cr-10063-DJC (D. Mass. Jan. 18, 2022)).] Crater was found guilty of those charges on July 21, 2022, and was sentenced to over eight years in prison and ordered to pay $7.6 million in restitution to defrauded customers and to forfeit&nbsp;</span><a name="_Hlk176509289"><span>$7.6 million,</span></a><span>&nbsp;which represented the proceeds he received from his violations.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, and the FBI.</span></p>
<p><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Jonah E. McCarthy, Patricia Gomersall, Daniel Ullman II, Paul G. Hayeck, and former staff members Jason Mahoney, John Einstman, Kyong J. Koh, and Hillary Van Tassel.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered an order against&nbsp;<strong>Rashawn Russell,&nbsp;</strong>a New York resident, in a CFTC action charging Russell with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation of investor assets obtained for the purported purpose of trading digital assets on behalf of customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order requires Russell to pay over $1.5 million in restitution to defrauded victims. The order also permanently enjoins Russell from engaging in conduct that violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, permanently bans him from registering with the CFTC and from solicitation for and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets on behalf of third parties, and bans him from trading for himself for a period of eight years. The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s action against Russell.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8686-23">8686-23</a>]<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The order, stemming from a CFTC complaint filed April 11, 2023, finds from November 2020 to August 2022 Russell engaged in a fraudulent digital assets trading scheme in which he solicited more than two dozen retail customers to contribute bitcoin, ether, and fiat currency to invest in his purported proprietary digital assets trading fund. The order further finds Russell intentionally and/or recklessly made false and misleading statements regarding the fund&rsquo;s structure, size, and performance to obtain and retain investors; failed to trade the money and assets as represented; and, falsely promised to pay withdrawal requests. The order finds Russell misappropriated over $1.5 million in customers assets through his fraudulent scheme, which he used, among other things, to pay personal expenses, entities associated with gambling activities, and Ponzi-like payments to current customers.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></p>
<p>On Sept. 19, 2023, Russell pled guilty to one count of wire fraud arising from the same digital assets trading scheme alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint and to one count of access device fraud arising from unrelated conduct.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[<em>United States v. Rashawn Russell</em>, Case No. 23-CR-152 (E.D.N.Y. 2023)] Russell was subsequently sentenced to over three years in prison, an additional term of three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay over $1.5 million in restitution to the victims of his trading scheme.</p>
<p><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice, Fraud Section.</span></p>
<p>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Rebecca Jelinek, Steve Turley, Tom Simek, Chris Reed, and Charles Marvine.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Tender Offers are being made upon the terms and subject to conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, dated&nbsp;February 10, 2025&nbsp;(as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the &ldquo;Offer to Purchase&rdquo;), which sets forth a detailed description of the Tender Offers. The Company reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase or decrease any or all of the Series Notes Caps and/or the Aggregate Notes Cap in its sole discretion at any time without extending or reinstating withdrawal rights, subject to compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>The Tender Offers for the Notes will expire at&nbsp;5:00 p.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;March 11, 2025, or any other date and time to which the Company extends the applicable Tender Offer (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the &ldquo;Expiration Date&rdquo;), unless earlier terminated. Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at&nbsp;5:00 p.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;February 24, 2025&nbsp;(such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the &ldquo;Early Tender Date&rdquo;), and the holder&rsquo;s Notes must be accepted for purchase, to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below).

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good morning and thank you so much for joining us. Today we are here to discuss recent changes we have made to the Bank of England&rsquo;s (the Bank&rsquo;s) regulatory and supervisory frameworks for Financial Market Infrastructure (FMIs) and our priorities for FMI regulation this year.</p>
<p>We are in a time, and in a sector, of sweeping technological advances, posing exciting opportunities to innovate within, and grow, the UK economy. As FMIs and regulators, we need to seize these opportunities, while understanding and mitigating the risks that come with them. In a context of heightened geopolitical tensions, embracing opportunities to find new, more effective ways of working, while ensuring FMIs&rsquo; resilience has never been more crucial.</p>
<p>Our priorities for the year will help you deliver on that ambition. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient.</li>
<li>Safe and sustainable innovation.</li>
<li>Financial resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient. Cyber and third-party providers pose some of the most significant risks here that need managing. Our policies set the framework for achieving resilience and we will be looking at firms&rsquo; progress carefully in line with the March deadline.</p>
<p>Safe and sustainable innovation. We want you to embrace the benefits that innovation offers, while managing the risks it poses. For our part, we will ensure our regulatory and supervisory frameworks facilitate innovation while maintaining financial stability.</p>
<p>Financial resilience. While we&rsquo;ve had the benefit of relative market stability recently, especially compared to previous years, we can&rsquo;t take our eye off financial resilience. For central counterparties (CCPs) we will use stress testing and other tools to monitor and probe risks, improve transparency and target mitigation.</p>
<p>To achieve these priorities, we need to continue to work openly and cooperatively together to mitigate risks, embrace innovation, and safely provide the critical infrastructure on which the economy relies.</p>
<h3>Why FMIs matter and our desired outcomes</h3>
<p>UK FMIs are essential to the global financial system. Every time an individual or business makes a transaction, your firms work behind the scenes to ensure it is processed smoothly, reducing and managing risk, particularly during periods of stress. The scale of this work is immense.</p>
<p>Day in, day out, CCPs clear trillions of pounds worth of contracts, the UK&rsquo;s central security depository, Euroclear UK &amp; International (EUI) settles nearly a trillion pounds of securities transactions, and our payment systems process countless retail and wholesale transactions. Confidence in FMI services is critical to a vibrant and prosperous economy, facilitating growth by allowing other businesses, individuals and financial market participants to transact and take informed risk safely.</p>
<p>While you deliver these services, it&rsquo;s the Bank&rsquo;s role to provide a regulatory and supervisory framework that ensures financial stability while facilitating innovation and supporting the wider economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-remarks-chair-ceo-ineds-roundtable-for-uk-financial-market-infrastructure-firms#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Our common goal of financially and operationally resilient FMIs delivering trusted services is best met when we work together, with an open dialogue, and an understanding of each other&rsquo;s needs and constraints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is a consequence we need to acknowledge; in managing risk, FMIs centralise it. Disruption or operational outages at an FMI can trigger severe financial instability and economic consequences, especially given that the participants of FMIs are often systemically important institutions that rely on FMIs for their proper functioning, and in the case of UK CCPs, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) such as large banks. CCPs play a crucial role supporting trading and management of counterparty risk, while central security depositories (CSDs) ensure securities settle on time and play an important role in the liquidity and collateral chain. And payment systems are key to liquidity, supporting wholesale and retail payments across all sectors of the economy. What is clear is that any significant disruption to the operation of FMIs could rapidly escalate into broader financial and economic turmoil and a corresponding loss in confidence in the financial system. While thankfully it didn&rsquo;t severely impact your firms, last summer&rsquo;s Crowdstrike incident demonstrated the risks and importance of our work on operational resilience, outsourcing and third-party suppliers, to ensure firms take action ahead of time to identify risks to delivery of their critical services and make themselves resilient to disruption.</p>
<p>If we look back further, history offers a stark reminder of how costly financial crises can be. The 2008 financial crisis was the most significant growth-destroying event in recent memory, but also highlighted the value of FMIs in reducing risk. This was dramatically illustrated through the difference in the ease with which the creditors of the failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers were able to deal with the losses arising from its cleared derivatives portfolio, using collateral the firm had deposited at the CCPs it used, against the years they spent dealing with losses from uncleared positions.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-remarks-chair-ceo-ineds-roundtable-for-uk-financial-market-infrastructure-firms#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;This relative success of CCPs during the crisis is part of what has made them such a central node of the financial system today. Supporting FMIs in playing this role in reducing risk, and ultimately avoiding a repeat of such a crisis, is the most important contribution we can make to sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a more shock prone world, with elevated volatility in part driven by geopolitical stress, it is critical that FMIs are aware of the potential risks they can create as they manage their own risks and the risks of other firms. Supported by the Bank of England,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/boe-and-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission">the international community has responded to risks around procyclicality of margin calls</a>, through new standards on margin transparency at CCPs which aim to improve centrally cleared market participants&rsquo; understanding of potential future margin requirements and margin responsiveness, helping to reduce the risk of severe procyclical effects in times of market volatility.</p>
<h3>Innovation: Playing our respective roles in embracing responsible innovation</h3>
<p>There has also been a step change in opportunities and risks arising from technological advances and we are committed to working with you to ensure we can embrace these opportunities safely. For payments, technological innovations are changing the landscape for providers, driven in large part by broader changes in what consumers expect. These advances will bring business opportunities and efficiencies as well as risks that need to be understood and managed. When safely implemented, they can also be used to help ensure resilience at FMIs, for instance through the huge potential in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to help monitor market activity and risk.</p>
<p>We need to work together to manage the risks and, importantly, make the most of the opportunities. As FMIs you will need to adapt your risk management strategies and business models to navigate this new environment effectively while making the most of the technological advances that could enable a step change in the services you provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits could be realised by bringing new technologies to existing firms (for example, through tokenisation or the introduction of atomic settlement) or through new types of FMIs joining the payments, settlement and clearing sectors. These technological advances are a good thing &ndash; but the risks need managing. We are keen to hear from you both on how you are innovating and the benefits that this is bringing, and any risks you see being created.</p>
<p>In line with our secondary objective to facilitate innovation, the Bank of England&rsquo;s role is to give you space to innovate in a way that protects financial stability. Our role in facilitating innovation can be both as catalyst, allowing safe experimentation through initiatives such as the Digital Securities Sandbox, but also by getting out of the way. Removing barriers allows your firms or new players to innovate to improve FMI services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also opportunities in RegTech allowing us to do our job more effectively, including to process approvals more efficiently. Increases in computing power and application of techniques like machine learning may also allow us to perform desk-based assessments of firm resilience that are higher frequency and wider in scope &ndash; for example, more regular stress tests against a wider range of scenarios.</p>
<h3>What we have done so far&nbsp;on our priorities</h3>
<p>Over the past year, the Bank has taken critical steps to evolve its approach with new powers and responsibilities in mind, while maintaining a robust commitment to financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have laid the groundwork for an FMI rulebook, through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/cp/fundamental-rules-for-financial-market-infrastructures">proposed Fundamental Rules</a>. This is an important and substantive area of work for the Bank to progress and clarify the outcomes we will require FMIs to meet. They are intended to drive board-level discussions about these outcomes and how firms can achieve them, supporting both our financial stability and innovation objectives.</p>
<p>We also refreshed our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/financial-market-infrastructure-supervision/what-do-we-do/the-bank-of-englands-approach-to-financial-market-infrastructure-supervision">approach to supervision</a>. Our supervisory approach is now more proportionate and risk-based, giving us greater flexibility to focus on the firms and issues that pose the greatest risks to our objectives, and providing us with more flexibility to choose to not intervene when we consider the costs outweigh the benefits. It also better accommodates the new and emerging risks that we see for FMIs.</p>
<p>In keeping with the thinking behind the Fundamental Rules, the supervisory approach will help ensure firms consider and reflect on the impact they can have on the financial system and the real economy in their decision making. Our new approach also ensures firms are prepared to work with the authorities in times of severe disruption.</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, we have made significant strides. We launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/november/operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-to-the-uk-financial-sector-policy-statement">Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime</a>&nbsp;and introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/cp/operational-resilience-operational-incident-and-outsourcing-and-third-party-reporting-for-fmis">proposals for operational incident and outsourcing reporting</a>, both of which help to ensure that the sectors&rsquo; operational resilience remains robust in the face of new challenges.&nbsp;We&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/stress-testing/2024/2024-ccp-supervisory-stress-test-results-report">stress-tested the financial resilience of CCPs</a>&nbsp;and contributed to international work on margin transparency.</p>
<p>We are also working with&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;to ensure your systems and processes are operationally resilient, given the end-of-March deadline for FMIs, to show us that they can remain within their impact tolerances when the critical services they offer are disrupted. You have been engaged in this work, with wargames, collaborative risk meetings and initiatives such as the Cross Market Operational Resilience Group.</p>
<p>Clearly there&rsquo;s more work for FMIs to do ahead of the end-March deadline. While this is a significant milestone, it is not the last piece of the puzzle. FMIs will need to continue to improve operational resilience as risks and technologies evolve. And be mindful of risks that could be posed by the process of introducing significant changes to the technology they use. Cyber threat actors who seek to harm the financial system will not stop developing their techniques, so FMIs need to remain vigilant to the changing threats they are exposed to. We as regulators need to work to ensure our requirements and guidance respond to those risks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s to come?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I wanted to return here to the three priorities that I set out at the start, building things out in a bit more detail.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk189149110"></a>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient: This remains a cornerstone of our work, and only grows in importance as geopolitical volatility increases. As well as working with you through the approaching deadline to meet our required standards, we will be focussing on embedding our oversight regime for CTPs and engaging with you on our operational incident and outsourcing requirements. We also plan to develop more detailed guidance to formalise our expectations on cyber resilience, in line with increased sophistication and risk of cyber events. This would have the aim of FMIs improving their ability to identify and prevent cyber incidents, advancing their capacity to test their resilience against potential incidents, and importantly detecting, responding, and recovering in a safe manner if defences are breached.</p>
<p>Facilitating safe and resilient innovation in payments, settlement and clearing: Through initiatives such as the Digital Securities Sandbox and the digital gilt (or DIGIT), we are focussed on facilitating innovation across payments, settlement and clearing in a way that drives growth while protecting financial stability. We are also implementing international standards for systemic stablecoins and will support innovation and enhancements within existing FMI services. As part of our work with HM Treasury (HMT) to repeal UK European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) for CCPs and replace it with Bank rules and relevant statutory provisions, together we are considering how we could simplify certain processes, such as for approving CCP margin models and authorising new products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring stability through financially resilient FMIs:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>For CCPs, we will propose rules to repeal EMIR and replace it with an adaptable and dynamic rulebook that aligns with evolving international standards, particularly on margin transparency. We will also engage with firms to further understand how changes in the clearing landscape impact your risk profile. We will also improve our use of data to monitor risks to financial and operational resilience.</p>
<p>Across all of this work, we will continue to improve our engagement with you &ndash; the FMIs we regulate. This year, we will finalise our Fundamental Rules after consultation &ndash; making clear our requirements across our regulatory priorities. Initiatives like the Fundamental Rules and our refreshed Supervisory Approach are part of this effort. However, we also want to find out how we can help you embrace innovative technologies and make sure that we are ready for the challenges ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With your help, we can seize the opportunities provided by both recent technological advances and our new powers and responsibilities to ensure:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>UK FMIs can thrive domestically and internationally, support growth through effective risk management, innovate safely and enhance resilience;</li>
<li>our Supervisory Approach remains strong and effective, is risk-based and flexible, and relevant to the shifting landscape of risks you engage with every day;</li>
<li>our regulatory framework balances high standards and certainty with the agility to address change, with rules that are clear and accessible, and supervisory actions that are outcomes focussed; and</li>
<li>we have a productive and open dialogue between regulators and industry with a &lsquo;no surprises&rsquo; culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This vision is ambitious, but it is achievable with your engagement and collaboration. Thank you for your work so far in realising this vision, and for your invaluable contributions to this vital sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to thank James Hoskins, Richard Spooner, Joe Irwin, Sadia Arif, Charlotte Kelly, Barry King, Justin Jacobs, Simon Morley, Shane Scott, Sarah Breeden, Michael Yoganayagam and Harsh Mehta for their contribution to these remarks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s inaugural address for his second presidency reverberated through both U.S. and international markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast stronger U.S. economic growth while cautioning that dramatic policy shifts could create headwinds for other economies and complicate monetary easing efforts by central banks worldwide. In the aftermath, U.S. treasury yields pushed higher as the dollar extends its rally.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>noted that the heavy concentration of U.S. market capitalization in a handful AI-technology stocks presents vulnerability to a major correction. Given the policy uncertainty, the Federal Reserve (Fed) may move toward monetary easing sooner than anticipated. This scenario could catalyze capital outflows from the U.S. market to emerging economies, with Thailand's stock market emerging as an attractive destination due to its low volatility, evidenced by the SET Index's end-of-day volatility. The Thai stock market's additional strength is the consistently strong dividend yield, with Thai stocks maintaining an average yield of 3.14 percent since 2000 to date. The Thai stock market thus positions itself as a compelling safe haven for investors pursuing defensive portfolio diversification.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for January</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of January 2025, the SET Index fell by 6.1 percent to close at 1,314.50 points. </li>
<li>Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Financials and Energy. </li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in January 2025 decreased 17.2 percent YoY to THB 39.01 billion (approx. USD 1.16 billion). However, local institutional investors' trading proportion demonstrated an upward trend, staying above 10 percent of total trading value for four consecutive months. </li>
<li>In January, there was one newly listed company on mai, namely Pro Inside pcl (PIS).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of January 2025 was 15.0 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.6 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.7 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 14.2 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of January 2025 was 3.64 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.28 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in January 2025 averaged 391,493 contracts, down 27.3 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 dropped 27.3 percent to 391,493 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<title>WFE FY24 Market Data: Americas Region Leading Global Markets Despite Lowest Level Of IPOs Worldwide In The Last 5 Years</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New data published by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, shows the buoyancy of the Americas region, which continues to lead global markets despite the lowest level of IPOs worldwide in the last 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of IPOs globally fell to the lowest level in the last 5 years, driven by the APAC and EMEA regions, but the number of IPOs in the Americas increased.</li>
<li>The Americas and APAC regions reached record trading volumes and market capitalisation, whilst EMEA declined across both indicators.</li>
<li>The Americas region&nbsp;reached its highest market capitalisation in the last 5 years, driven mostly by gains in tech stocks.</li>
<li>The funds raised through IPOs in the Americas and EMEA regions rose, 91% and 61% respectively.</li>
<li>The capital raised globally through IPOs recorded a slight downtick on 2023, due mainly to the APAC region which raised the lowest amount in the last five years despite hosting the largest IPO globally, Midea Group.</li>
<li>Though we saw fewer IPOs globally, the average size of an IPO increased by 7.6% compared to 2023, and the number of IPOs raising over USD$1bn more than doubled year on year. In 2023 these IPOs added USD$16.14bn to capital markets, whilst in 2024 they reached USD$36.40bn.</li>
<li>The data shows that overall, the average trading size was at its lowest in the last 5 years, suggesting that more retail investors were active in the market. The Americas bucked this trend, recording its largest average trade size in the last 5 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE commented,</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Investors turn to public markets to finance the future. As we start 2025, it's crucial for new Governments and policymakers worldwide to reaffirm their commitment to keeping these markets dynamic. We need to see policies that not only foster investment in transparent, well-regulated markets, but also empower and encourage businesses to list and access essential capital for growth.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE commented,</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The data reflects the persistence of geopolitical tensions and uncertainty derived from elections. In 2024 we also saw substantive changes in monetary policy around the world. Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions will remain a key driver of capital markets, and determiner of business confidence, IPO activity, and investor sentiment. By the half year, the data should show the impact of US policy developments on market performance globally. Longer-term, the patterns we are starting to see in how technological advancements are impacting market composition and growth, could become starker.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Key data points:</strong><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>360T, a best-in-class global Foreign Exchange (FX) trading platform and technology provider, and Quantitative Brokers (QB), a leading provider of advanced execution algorithms and data-driven analytics, have announced a partnership that will make QB&rsquo;s newly launched suite of FX algos available via 360T.</p>
<p>Both 360T and QB are part of the Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group.</p>
<p>Since QB was launched in 2008, the firm has become widely recognised as the market-leading provider of independent algos and analytics in the Futures, US Cash Treasury and Options markets due to a combination of its specialist engineering expertise, deep understanding of market microstructure and research-focused culture.</p>
<p>In response to client demand, QB and 360T have partnered to bring QB's proven execution expertise to the Spot FX market. This expansion introduces FX-optimised versions of its flagship algorithms, &ldquo;Bolt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strobe&rdquo;, designed specifically to account for the unique market structure and liquidity dynamics of FX trading. Strobe FX enhances schedule-based execution for TWAP and VWAP benchmarks, while Bolt FX is an implementation shortfall algorithm built to minimise execution costs relative to arrival price.</p>
<p>These FX capabilities are now available via 360T&rsquo;s platform, enabling users to deploy them across highly curated disclosed or anonymous liquidity pools, putting multiple counterparties in competition to help ensure best execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to announce this partnership with QB and are confident that providing access to highly sophisticated FX algos from an independent specialist provider, as additional tools alongside the broad range of bank offered algos already available via 360T, will provide significant benefits to our diverse and global client base,&rdquo; said Matt O&rsquo;Hara, CEO of 360T Americas.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;This partnership also delivers on Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s strategic vision to bring together highly complementary technology solutions from independently operating providers within the organisation to create a truly differentiated offering and further accelerate growth, while also fully aligning with 360T&rsquo;s commitment to constant innovation in FX.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Quantitative Brokers is deeply committed to delivering enhanced value to our clients while expanding our reach to a broader spectrum of market participants. We are thrilled to bring our extensive expertise and proven track record in developing state-of-the-art execution algorithms to the FX market at a time when demand for such solutions is growing rapidly.

<title>The Complex Challenge Of Advice - Speech By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Conexus Financial Professional Planner 2025 Advice Policy Summit, 10 February 2025.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Financial advisers are entrusted by their clients to help them make confident and informed decisions. In many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</span></li>
<li><span>ASIC has observed some positive signs of improvement &ndash; but there continues to be too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers</span>.</li>
<li><span>In light of some of these poor practices, &lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo; and &lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo; have been selected as 2025 enforcement priorities</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning everyone.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal people as the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we are gathering today &ndash; and by paying my respects to their elders past, present and emerging and extending that respect to any First Nations people with us here today.</p>
<p>One of ASIC&rsquo;s core functions is to promote the confident and informed participation of consumers and investors in our financial system &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why I was pleased to accept this invitation to speak at this Advice Policy Summit.</p>
<p>Not everybody needs or seeks advice to support their participation in the financial system. But when they do, it&rsquo;s important that they have access to good quality advice that meets their needs and is delivered with independence and integrity.</p>
<p>While that&rsquo;s a simple objective, achieving it is not easy.</p>
<p>As is clear from ASIC&rsquo;s work over many years, the complexity of the financial system, the range of products and business models, the interconnected nature of some of those, and indeed the range of knowledge and capacity that people bring when they engage with the system, make consumer protection and financial advice a complex challenge.</p>
<p>Sometimes this results in very complex legislation, as I know you&rsquo;re all aware of. And sometimes that is helpful. But we&rsquo;re also increasingly conscious that sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>Complexity can often be an obstacle to compliance, and to effective regulation. In our experience, the simpler a set of rules, the more enforceable they are. That&rsquo;s not just good for consumers and investors. It&rsquo;s also good for businesses and professionals, who get greater clarity about what&rsquo;s required of them.</p>
<p>And while the legislative framework is a matter for the Government, we&lsquo;re conscious that we administer a complex range of regulatory guidance and legislative instruments. With a significant amount of that focusing on the requirements that apply to people involved in the provision of financial advice.</p>
<p>In November last year, our Chair Joe Longo announced the creation of a Simplification Consultative Group, to advise ASIC on what we can do, within our powers, to address this issue of complexity. We will be seeking your views on this work during 2025. So if it&rsquo;s an issue of interest to you, I encourage you to keep an eye out for further announcements in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But returning to the topic of today&rsquo;s forum, advice policy, I&rsquo;d like to start by talking about ASIC&rsquo;s role in policy &ndash; in general and also in relation to the advice-related reforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll then share some reflections on what we are seeing in terms of the quality of advice.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll finish with some notes on what you can expect to see from ASIC over the next year, given our priorities.</p>
<h2>Policy: preparation, implementation and compliance</h2>
<p>So, first to ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to policy.</p>
<p>ASIC doesn&rsquo;t make policy decisions. Nor do we design regulatory reform. That&rsquo;s the role of the Government, guided by advice from Treasury, with Parliament, of course, making the ultimate decision on any changes to legislation.</p>
<p>ASIC does, of course, assist Treasury through that process. But our role really comes into play once legislative reforms have passed, where we&rsquo;ve got an important role in helping industry to understand what the new requirements mean for them, and how to comply with them. And, obviously, a key way in which we do this is through producing regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>The Delivering Better Financial Outcomes (DBFO) reforms provide the most recent examples of this work. As you know, and we&rsquo;ve already talked about this morning, it&rsquo;s being rolled out in a series of tranches. And through this process, we&rsquo;ve been liaising with industry &ndash; through various professional associations, through our supervisory work and stakeholder forums, including our own Financial Adviser Consultative Panel.</p>
<p>Coming from that work, in October and November we released &ndash; following the passage of the first tranche &ndash; a suite of new and updated regulatory guidance and other supporting information. And we continue to seek input from stakeholders on the content of our regulatory guidance, some of which may result in further updates to that guidance. And as further reforms are legislated, we&rsquo;ll continue through that process.</p>
<p>Similarly, with the introduction of professional standards for financial advisers, we continue to update our guidance &ndash; and we&rsquo;ll no doubt be doing that further as a result of some announcements earlier today. This, to date, includes information about the impact of the reforms, timeframes for compliance and the requirements for accessing different pathways.</p>
<p>As reforms begin to take effect, industry participants sometimes encounter practical issues that are raised with us, often by industry groups. We&rsquo;re always really keen to listen to those concerns and, where it&rsquo;s appropriate and within our powers, we&rsquo;re willing to consider taking action to support the intent of the relevant reforms.</p>
<p>As an example, following industry concerns about the practical implications of the changes to Financial Services Guide (FSG) requirements, we registered a legislative instrument late last year, which broadened the use of website disclosure. So that it can be used in relation to dealing in a financial product for the purposes of implementing financial product advice, as well as for the advice itself. And I know that was something that was welcomed by many around the industry.</p>
<p>Of course, once legislation is in place, we also then shift focus to monitoring compliance &ndash; and one of the key ways in which we do that is through thematic reviews.</p>
<p>These typically involve selecting a selection of advisers and licensees, gathering data and information to help us to assess levels of compliance with particular legislative provisions. We then publish our findings, highlighting good practices and areas for improvement to assist the sector and drive further compliance.</p>
<p>And a good example of this from the past year would be Report 779, which examined the role of super trustees, financial advisers and licensees in relation to choice superannuation products &ndash; which I discussed at another Conexus event late last year which I know a number of you were present at [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>].</p>
<p>Then the other key aspect of our role is, of course, enforcement. Where we see serious non-compliance &ndash; which might be something we identify through our thematic reviews, it might be through reportable situations, it might be through reports of misconduct that come directly to us from members of the public &ndash; we may refer that misconduct for investigation, which can, of course, lead to litigation by ASIC or referral to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for potential prosecution.</p>
<p>We provide clear guidance to industry about our priorities, the areas of focus in our enforcement work, through annual enforcement priorities, which I&rsquo;ll discuss a bit later.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s view on the quality of advice</h2>
<p>Before speaking about our priorities for the next year, Conexus invited me to make a few comments about what we&rsquo;re seeing in terms of the quality of advice and whether it&rsquo;s improved, given the reforms of recent years.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, we&rsquo;ve seen some positive indications through work that ASIC has done. That includes the work that we did on the Life Insurance Framework Review, where we saw a significant improvement in the quality of advice between 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>And although the scope and findings of that work were limited to life insurance advice, some of our observations from the review and input from industry stakeholders suggest that several factors have influenced an improvement in standards of advice in parts of the industry.</p>
<p>They, of course, include the adviser education standards and improved focus by licensees on the best interests duty, and the adoption of some of the recommendations that we made in 2017, following a review of how large institutions were overseeing advisers [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-515-financial-advice-review-of-how-large-institutions-oversee-their-advisers/" title="REP 515 Financial advice: Review of how large institutions oversee their advisers">REP 515</a>].</p>
<p>We also observed, in that work, that record-keeping across client advice files had materially improved. And that&rsquo;s important because record-keeping helps demonstrate compliance, and it&rsquo;s long been an area of focus for ASIC and will continue to be so.</p>
<h2>Areas of concern</h2>
<p>At the same time, however, we continue to see too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers.</p>
<p>Our ongoing investigation into the Shield Master Fund is one such example &ndash; though regrettably it&rsquo;s not an isolated one. It reflects a pattern of conduct we are seeing all too frequently.</p>
<p>This pattern commonly involves telemarketers recruiting consumers before passing them onto advisers. These advisers then recommend that consumers withdraw their superannuation savings from a regulated fund and invest them, sometimes via an SMSF (self-managed super fund), into a high-risk property scheme or some other high-risk investment.</p>
<p>Our Deputy Chair Sarah Court has described some of this misconduct as occurring &lsquo;at industrial scale&rsquo;. And this can result in the significant erosion &ndash; or complete loss &ndash; of a person&rsquo;s retirement savings. And while there is often a complex web of individuals and entities involved, inappropriate or poor-quality advice typically plays a pivotal role in the ultimate consumer outcomes.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s priorities</h2>
<p>Those comments are a bit of a backdrop to some of our priorities for the current year, which I&rsquo;ll talk about now. I&rsquo;ll talk about our strategic priorities and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>We have five longer-term&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/our-role/our-vision-and-strategic-priorities/" title="Our vision and strategic priorities">strategic priorities</a>&nbsp;but there are two in particular that I&rsquo;ll call out as having an impact on advice.</p>
<p>The first is to&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;improve consumer outcomes&rsquo;</strong>. And this includes our work in a range of areas, such as predatory sales tactics, design and distribution obligations and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>And I would like to particularly highlight the work on dispute resolution. We, of course, now receive data on a six-monthly basis on firms&rsquo; internal dispute resolution. We have made it clear that we will be publishing firm-level data from that data collection during the course of 2025.</p>
<p>Late last year, we published a higher-level overview of what we were seeing from the initial data collection, with some observations around some of the data quality issues. And, I guess, I mention that because with firm-level publication coming, firms have got an opportunity to really focus on how to improve the quality of their data before that becomes publicly available.</p>
<p>The second strategic priority to highlight is&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;better retirement outcomes and member services&rsquo;</strong>. And while this includes our well-publicised work on member services for members of super funds, our work in this area is not limited to super. It also includes a focus on entities and individuals involved in the provision of advice.</p>
<p>An important initiative in this area is our thematic review into self-managed super fund establishment advice, which is focusing on why some clients are advised to set up an SMSF.</p>
<p>As part of this, we&rsquo;re reviewing client advice files, where SMSF establishment advice was provided, to assess compliance with the best interests duty and related obligations. We&rsquo;re also reviewing information from licensees about their oversight and the application of their policies and procedures in the context of SMSF establishment advice. And I expect that we&rsquo;ll release the findings from this work in the second half of this calendar year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, besides our strategic priorities, we also have&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">enforcement priorities</a>, which are announced annually. And these target specific forms of misconduct that are of serious concern to ASIC.</p>
<p>Over the coming year, you can expect, through those priorities, to see a sustained focus on advice-related misconduct.</p>
<p>In light of some of the poor practices we&rsquo;re seeing, which I&rsquo;ve spoken about, the 2025 priorities include&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>And I want to say, our work in this area won&rsquo;t be limited to superannuation trustees or responsible entities of managed investment schemes. It will include the broad range of entities involved in conduct causing harm to consumers and investors &ndash; including advisers and licensees.</p>
<p>And the final thing I want to say is those enforcement priorities are set in a context in which our investment in enforcement and our appetite for taking on significant matters are increasing.</p>
<p>We currently have action underway against NAB, HSBC, the ASX, Harvey Norman, QBE and Rex. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the trial of former directors and officers of the Star Entertainment Group, which is commencing today. The number of investigations that we commenced in the last six months of 2024 was up more than 30%, year-on-year, and some of these will flow through into future litigation and compliance action.</p>
<p>And I really hope that this stronger approach to enforcement is something that&rsquo;s welcomed by people in this room. Because when advice goes terribly wrong, the harm that it causes to consumers can damage confidence in the entire industry.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I wanted to say by way of intro. Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, one of our core functions is to promote the informed participation of consumers and investors in the system.</p>
<p>Your clients trust you to help them make confident and informed decisions &ndash; and, in many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</p>
<p>So, I hope that these comments give you confidence that ASIC is committed to continuing to work with you to help you to comply with the law in ways that produce good outcomes for consumers. Thank you.</p>

<title>Hedge Funds Gain In January To Begin 2025, Navigating Policy Changes And Tech Volatility: HFR</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Directional Equity Hedge extends strong 2024 to lead broad-based HFRI Composite gains</li>
<li>Shareholder Activist, Fundamental, Quantitative lead sub-strategy performance</li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge funds gained in January to begin 2025 navigating a volatile month highlighted the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US President, confirmation procedures of key appointed Cabinet positions, and a wide range of executive orders implementing policy changes across a number of areas including immigration, trade/tariffs, energy policy and spending reductions. In addition to this, managers also navigated a volatile month in the technology sector, with earnings, capital expenditures and strategic outlooks impacted by intense competition in the AI space driven by the Chinese startup Deepseek.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite gained +1.4 percent for the month, led by the directional HFRI Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +2.1 percent. The HFR Cryptocurrency Index extended its 2024 surge, adding +0.36 percent in January on the favorable outlook for cryptocurrency by the incoming Trump administration. The recently launched HFRI Multi-Manager/Pod Shop Index advanced +1.9 percent for the month as managers navigated policies from the new administration, as well as Technology volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge fund performance dispersion contracted slightly in January, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.9 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 12.0 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in December 2024 was 13.2 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending January 2025, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +41.4 percent, while the bottom decile declined -9.9 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 51.3 percent. Nearly eighty percent (80%) of hedge funds produced positive performance in January.</span></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="m_-9209425515007766492__Hlk189820723"><b><span lang="EN-US">HFR continues to expand index offerings, launches indices delineated by fund liquidity</span></b></a><span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">HFR unveiled an expansion of its HFRI, HFRI 500 and HFRI 400 index families, launching new indices delineated by fund liquidity. The new composite and strategy-level indices are split into two liquidity categories: one for funds with monthly (or more frequent) liquidity, the other comprised of funds offering less than monthly liquidity (quarterly, etc.). The purpose of the new indices is to empower investors by offering hedge fund benchmarks that more closely resemble the liquidity characteristics of their underlying hedge fund or other alternative asset portfolios.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge continues to lead main strategy performance</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, extended 2024 leadership with a strong gain to begin 2025 while navigating both new policy and technology sector volatility, with the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index advancing +2.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index, which surged +3.6 percent for the month, the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, which jumped +2.8 percent, and the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which added +1.65 percent in January.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Uncorrelated Macro strategies also advanced in January to begin 2025 as interest rates fell while commodities gained, with the HFRI Macro (Total) Index adding +1.0 percent in January, while the HFRI Macro Asset Weighted gained +2.0 percent. Macro sub-strategy performance was led by the HFRI Macro: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.5 percent, and the HFRI Macro: Discretionary Thematic Index, which added +1.6 percent for the month.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also gained in January as recent policy changes have increased expectations for a strong M&amp;A cycle in 2025. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index advanced +0.9 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Activist Index, which jumped +2.4 percent, and the HFRI ED: Credit Arbitrage Index, which added +1.95 percent in January.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies produced another gain as interest rates declined despite significant gains in the US Dollar, with the HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index gaining an estimated +0.8 percent for the month marking the Index 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;consecutive monthly gain and 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;gain in last 30 months. RVA strategy performance was led by the HFRI RV: FI-Convertible Arbitrage Index, which advanced +1.3 percent for the month, followed closely by the HFRI RV: Multi-Strategy Index, which added +1.2 percent.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies also gained in January, with the HFRX Market Directional Index gaining +2.35 percent while the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index advanced +1.0 percent. Strategy gains were led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which gained +2.1 percent.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&ldquo;Hedge funds posted gains to begin 2025, effectively navigating a challenging environment dominated by volatility in the technology sector, as well as announcements of executive orders and implementation of new policies effecting a wide range of industries including trade/tariffs, immigration, energy and many others. Despite the volatility, directional Equity Hedge strategies led broad-based strategy gains for the month, with contributions from Fundamental, Quantitative and Shareholder Activist sub-strategy exposures,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;Many financial market risks have shifted and evolved but not fallen, with geopolitical risk shifting from election outcomes and military conflicts to policy changes and conflict resolution; inflation and interest rate risks remain, while expectations for continued growth in AI-fueled large cap technology are in some cases tempered by high capital expenditures and intense global competition. Managers have been positioning for this dynamic environment for several months, with intensive positioning since the US election in November, and it is likely that managers are positioned for acceleration of these policy changes throughout 1H25. Investors are likely to increase allocations to managers which have effectively demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s specialized ability to navigate these policy changes and rapidly shifting market cycles which create both risk and opportunities.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>SEC: Exemption From Exchange Act Rule 13f-2 And Related Form SHO</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-exemption-from-exchange-act-rule-13f-2-and-related-form-sho-202528/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-exemption-from-exchange-act-rule-13f-2-and-related-form-sho-202528/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided a temporary exemption from compliance with Rule 13f-2 under the Securities Exchange Act and from reporting on Form SHO. As a result of the exemption, filings on initial Form SHO reports from institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds will be due by Feb. 17, 2026, for the January 2026 reporting period. The effective date for Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO was Jan. 2, 2024, and the compliance date for such rule and form was Jan. 2, 2025, with initial Form SHO filings originally due by Feb. 14, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 requires institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds to file Form SHO with the Commission within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month with regard to certain equity securities via the Commission&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR). The Commission will publish, on an aggregated basis, certain information regarding each equity security reported by institutional investment managers on Form SHO and filed with the Commission via EDGAR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. &ldquo;This exemption gives filers more time to implement the technical updates required for compliance according to standards that were released only on Dec. 16, 2024, immediately prior to the holidays. Regardless of this exemption, abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful, and the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exemption will provide industry participants sufficient time to work with Commission staff to address any outstanding operational and compliance questions. This exemption will also provide filers sufficient time to complete implementation of system builds and testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency is essential to well-functioning markets. And the Commission has stated the importance of providing more disclosure about short selling. It is also important to enhance the accuracy of the short sale-related data that would ultimately be provided to investors by giving institutional investment managers additional time.</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO reporting will enhance the transparency of other available short sale-related information. Currently, several self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are providing on their websites daily aggregate short selling volume information for individual equity securities. The SROs are also providing website disclosure on a one-month delayed basis of information regarding individual short sale transactions in all exchange-listed equity securities. Hyperlinks to short sale data&nbsp;provided by specific SROs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/short-sale-volume-and-transaction-data">are available</a>. Further, the SROs are also publishing monthly statistics on short interest in securities that trade on their markets.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/fails-deliver-data">publishes on its website</a>&nbsp;failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is such a pleasure to be back in Miami, a city I have seen grow and become ever more dynamic over the decades, as I have come many times to visit my large extended family here ever since the 1980s.</p>
<p>As I discussed in my final speech of 2024, two positive supply shocks have significantly benefited the U.S. economy over the past two years and have also affected the conduct of monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The first of these has been the surge in population over the past few years that has helped bring labor supply into balance with labor demand and, thus, also helped move inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. The other positive supply shock, which I outlined in my remarks in December, has been a step-up in aggregate productivity growth since 2020, which is an increase in the amount of economic output, across the economy, per hour worked or some other unit of labor. Although productivity growth, measured quarterly, can be quite volatile, over the past five years this acceleration is quite evident. While productivity grew by about 1.5 percent a year from 2005 to 2019, starting in 2020 it has grown about 2 percent a year. This difference may not look dramatic, but because of compounding year-over-year, the consequences of an additional 1/2 percentage point in growth over the past five years are significant for workers and the U.S. economy. When workers are more productive, it effectively means that businesses can produce more without needing to add workers, and that they can pay workers more without needing to raise prices. When they are more productive, it can also serve as an incentive for businesses to expand. Across the economy, higher productivity growth means that real wages and living standards for workers can rise faster without putting upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what has been happening recently, a period when inflation has been falling while the economy is expanding. While fast growth in wages was one of the factors driving inflation in 2021 and 2022, most likely some of that increase was due to productivity growth and, hence, was not inflationary. If productivity continues to grow at an accelerated pace, it would support the FOMC's efforts to keep unemployment low and return inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to spend the balance of my remarks exploring some of the possible reasons why productivity has accelerated, and the prospects that this fortunate development will continue.</p>
<p>Numerous factors affect aggregate productivity, and several may have driven the increase in productivity growth in the U.S. since the pandemic, in contrast to the subdued productivity growth experienced by other advanced economies around the world.</p>
<p>One such factor may have been a result of the enormous movement of workers caused by the pandemic. It began with the dramatic loss of 22 million jobs in the spring of 2020, the reemployment of many of those workers and the continued mobility as people quit jobs, switched occupations and careers, and relocated in response to the enormous changes in work and home life brought about by the pandemic. In finding new jobs, in what became a very tight labor market, workers had the opportunity to find better matches for their skills and, to some extent, work that they were motivated to carry out and which made them more productive. One indication that this was probably a significant factor in the U.S. is that other advanced economies where there was less worker movement have experienced lower rates of productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Economic data and research suggest that periods of strong job re-allocation are accompanied or followed by higher productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>The tightness of the labor market since 2021 has also likely led firms to invest to a greater extent in labor-saving as well as labor-enhancing technologies, which, of course, is traditionally one of the major sources of productivity gains. For example, many retail businesses seemed to have installed more self-checkout machines after the onset of the pandemic, allowing employers to substitute capital for workers when workers could not come to work in person and when there were severe shortages. More generally, digital technology allowed employees to continue working from home during the period of the pandemic and beyond, saving commuting time and making employees potentially more productive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>To the extent that these factors are boosting productivity growth, they are by their nature one-off developments that eventually will fade. A notable exception may turn out to be productivity improvements from investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI investment by businesses has stepped up in the past two years, and it appears to be accelerating.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The advent of the internet and related innovations boosted productivity growth for about 10 years starting in the mid-1990s, and the benefits of AI could potentially be that revolutionary and persistent.</p>
<p>In addition to being temporary, the factors that I have outlined that could be boosting productivity, job re-allocation, and technological investments are themselves hard to measure across the economy. And so are their effects on productivity as well. But there is another important factor that is likely to be driving productivity higher whose effects may well persist, and that is the surge in new business formation experienced since 2019. As I will explain, new businesses are associated with higher rates of overall productivity growth, and that may be particularly true for some of the sectors in which these businesses were created.</p>
<p>Applications for new business tax identification numbers jumped shortly after the pandemic began and have remained elevated since then.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In 2024, the pace of applications that are likely to result in employer business formation was about 30 percent above its 2019 pace. This surge is largely unique to the U.S. In the euro zone, for example, business registrations have been relatively flat. This may help explain why labor productivity growth in Europe has been well below that of the U.S. in recent years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The surge in applications in early 2020 was an early signal of an acceleration in the creation of job-creating new firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The latest data available indicate that new firms created 1.9 million jobs in 2023, 14 percent higher than the total for 2019.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A couple of aspects of this surge in business entry in the U.S. are noteworthy. First, the surge was particularly noticeable in high-tech industries that, historically, are important for overall innovation and productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Second, while the pace of business applications has cooled somewhat over the past year, it still remains elevated and well above pre-pandemic norms. It is, in fact, proving somewhat more persistent than some expected.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the surge in new business formation is highly relevant to our discussion about productivity. There is a large body of research that finds that new firms are key contributors to innovation and growth in aggregate productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a><span>&nbsp;</span>This might seem surprising and counterintuitive, since it is well known that many new firms fail in their first year or two. But in the commotion of competition that these many new businesses face, there are always businesses that persist and keep their lights on, and those often do so because they are innovative and more productive. New businesses are the essence of the competition that drives market-based economies, and it is not surprising that they would be an important source of new products or processes for doing business&mdash;and a source of growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Of course, not every new firm has to innovate and grow to make important economic contributions. Every entrepreneur contributes even if they just create a job for themselves and their family members. But those new firms that do innovate and grow are critical for improvements in overall productivity over time.</p>
<p>As I noted before, since the surge in entrepreneurship after the onset of the pandemic featured an increase in high-tech businesses as well, the productivity implications could be significant. Indeed, the last period of strong productivity growth in the U.S., which ran from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, was preceded by a surge of new business creation in high-tech industries, including those industries that more recently have been associated with AI-related developments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;So this is one source of my optimism about continued robust productivity growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>But it is not only the innovations produced directly by new businesses that are important, since by any measure these new firms are a small share of total businesses. New businesses also help drive innovation by existing firms. As they scramble for funding, customers, and human capital, new businesses will increase competition with existing ones, forcing them to innovate as well so they can succeed. This is surely also driving the recent acceleration in productivity growth.</p>
<p>Many predicted that the surge in new business creation would disappear as effects of the pandemic have faded, but this has not really happened. It is possible that the surge in entry will recede and that its productivity effects will likewise be temporary. On the other hand, the productivity gains from a surge in entry could last for some time, since these highly productive young firms have been found to grow rapidly for several years, contributing to aggregate productivity growth along the way. Time will tell, but for now, it seems likely that this is a factor supporting productivity growth at a higher-than-historical rate.</p>
<p>I will confess to you all that it is not a coincidence that I have come to Miami to highlight the role of entrepreneurship in innovation and productivity growth. Miami and the Miami metropolitan area is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial area, a place with high rates of new business creation, and it is likely an important source of the recent productivity surge.</p>
<p>Out of more than 900 U.S. cities for which we have data, Miami's post-pandemic new firm entry rate ranked 8th in the nation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;And Miami is not alone in Florida; 5 of the top 20 cities for pandemic-era business formation are here in your state.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Miami specifically, and Florida generally, has been a key part of the U.S. entrepreneurship story for some time. During the decade before the pandemic, Miami ranked 5th out of more than 900 U.S. cities for firm entry rates, and Florida featured 8 of the top 20 U.S. cities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Miami is special in this regard. I wonder what is in the water here to produce such a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Perhaps it is the extent of sunshine, which has long been associated with optimism. Perhaps it is the friendly economic climate&mdash;in my own academic research, I have found that policies that facilitate business entry and support worker or job re-allocation are indeed helpful for dynamism and productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;But an interesting question for me as the first Hispanic at the Board of Governors since its creation is whether the large Hispanic population in Florida is also a factor behind the impressive pace of business dynamism that I have just described.</p>
<p>More than 25 percent of Florida's population is Hispanic, compared with around 20 percent for the United States as a whole.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Nationwide, recent data indicate that Latinos account for a dominant&mdash;and rapidly growing&mdash;share of new entrepreneurship in the U.S., with a particular increase since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Of course, many of these Latino entrepreneurs are also immigrants, another group with a well-known proclivity for entrepreneurship.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;There are immigrants in Miami from the Caribbean and all over the world who contribute to the entrepreneurial culture of this city, and it is surely this culture, as much as the efforts of any nationality or group, that is the real engine of the dynamism here. I applaud you all for fostering that culture here in Florida, which is such an important contributor to the economic growth of our nation. More entrepreneurs means more productivity, which is crucial to U.S. prosperity.</p>
<p>Let me conclude with an outline of my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and the FOMC's efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a strong labor market.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy remains on a firm footing.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) continues to grow at a solid pace. The Bureau for Economic Analysis estimates that real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, and private domestic final purchases, which is the best indicator for GDP one quarter ahead, grew a solid 3.2 percent. Therefore, I anticipate solid GDP growth also in the first quarter of this year. In addition, earlier today the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers created 143,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged down to 4 percent, consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.</p>
<p>Inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, and in September the FOMC judged that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels intended to strongly restrict aggregate demand and put downward pressure on inflation. We reduced our policy rate 100 basis points through December, but the recent progress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated. There is also considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of proposals of new policies. Going forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
