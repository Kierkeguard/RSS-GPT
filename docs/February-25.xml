<ul class="bullet-listing">

<h5>Market capitalisation of approximately NOK 8.1 billion</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The 8<span>th</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext so far this year</h5>

<p>The offshore drilling company Constellation Oil Services Holding S.A. (ticker: COSH) was today admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo. This is the eighth listing of the year on Euronext and the first listing on Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Constellation is one of the largest offshore drilling contractors in Brazil. The company owns and operates a fleet of seven offshore rigs, including six ultra-deepwater rigs.

Constellation has 1,800 employees and is registered under the laws of Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In December 2024, Constellation completed a recapitalisation, and has therefore not raised additional capital as part of the listing. The reference price before market opening was set at NOK 5.34, giving the company a market capitalisation of approximately NOK 8.1 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Rodrigo Ribeiro, CEO of Constellation, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The listing on Euronext Growth Oslo is a significant milestone for Constellation and reflects the confidence that investors have in our business model, operational efficiency and cash generation capacity.

<title>REMIT Breach: Energi Danmark Fined For Manipulating The Nordic Wholesale Electricity Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The fine imposed on Energi Danmark A/S (Energi Danmark) is based on a report made by the Danish Energy Regulatory Authority (Danish Utility Regulator, DUR) in March 2024, which was referred to the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime.</p>
<p>This penalty comes under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGVw9QUARXB0wKU1BUHVYKBAIdUAkHURoGBABUBVFUVlADUgUdUwdUUgkEVQUdUAoGAh0GAQQDGg1WBAQZClQEBwECBlMFB1oFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011</a>, which prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>According to energy regulator (DUR) and the Danish state prosecutor, the misconduct, which took place on 3 January 2020, included five cases of electricity market manipulation and one attempt to do so in violation of Article 5 of REMIT. Through its behaviour, called 'cross-zonal capacity hoarding', the company acquired all, or a significant share of, the capacity available on an electricity transmission connection between two bidding areas by trading with itself. In this way, Energi Danmark prevented other market participants from using the capacity, thereby creating or increasing a price difference between the two bidding areas.</p>
<p>DUR estimated the financial gain from the conduct at DKK 80,693 (approximately EUR 10,800). The prosecutor fined Energi Danmark 380,000 DKK (approximately EUR 50,900), which Energi Danmark has accepted to pay.</p>
<p>In December 2018, Energi Danmark had already agreed to pay a fine of DKK 750,000 (approximately EUR 100,500) for violating the same REMIT regulation prohibition of market manipulation, which DUR emphasised as an aggravating circumstance in its report.</p>
<p>The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) welcomes this third decision related to the hoarding of cross-border electricity transmission capacity in Denmark. ACER emphasises the importance of vigorous enforcement to enhance public trust in the EU&rsquo;s electricity markets and protect European&nbsp;consumers from market abuse.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="sizeable">Today, Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) proudly marks the 35th anniversary of the world's first exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a special market close event featuring guests from across Canada's ETF industry.</p>
<p class="sizeable">The Toronto 35 Index&reg; Participation Units, or TIPs&reg;, the world's first exchange-traded, index-linked product, was launched on March 9, 1990, and served as the prototype for the modern-day ETF. As ETFs have grown into a leading global investment vehicle, the Canadian ETF market has remained at the forefront of the industry, with TSX leading the way in innovation, including listing the world's first fixed income ETF in 2000 and the world's first Bitcoin ETF in 2021.</p>
<p class="sizeable">In January 2024, TMX Group, owner and operator of TSX, broadened and enriched its support of the ETF industry with the acquisition of VettaFi, a leading US-based, indexing, digital distribution, analytics and thought leadership company.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"We are extremely proud to see that ETFs - a Canadian invention - have changed the financial markets and the way that investors interact with markets around the world," said Loui Anastasopoulos, CEO, Toronto Stock Exchange. "We look forward to working with asset managers to continue to build this industry in Canada, as well as through our investment in TMX VettaFi to extend the services we offer on a global scale."</p>
<p class="sizeable">At the end of January 2025, TSX ETFs held over $560 billion in AUM across 1,073 products. In 2024, $753 billion worth of ETF units were traded in Canada. Options on 53 ETFs trade on Montr&eacute;al Exchange, Canada's derivatives exchange and a wholly-owned subsidiary of TMX Group.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"The Canadian ETF ecosystem has experienced remarkable growth and innovation in the past 35 years," said Graham Mackenzie, Managing Director, Exchange Traded Products, Toronto Stock Exchange. "We are thankful to our clients, partners and stakeholders who have helped the Canadian industry reach a significant milestone of $600 billion in assets under management."</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that its BrokerTec business reached a new single-day volume record of&nbsp;$1.05 trillion&nbsp;in average daily notional volume (ADNV) traded on&nbsp;March 3. Surpassing the ADNV of&nbsp;$909B&nbsp;for&nbsp;February 2025, this new all-time high was driven by a series of individual product records across the U.S. Treasuries, U.S. and EU Repo, and European Government Bond central limit order book (CLOB), request-for-quote (RFQ), and streaming platforms.</p>
<p>Additional&nbsp;March 3&nbsp;volumes included:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>U.S. Repo:&nbsp;$407B&nbsp;ADNV, the second largest U.S. Repo volume day ever;</li>
<li>EU Repo: &euro;350B ADNV; and</li>
<li>U.S. Treasuries:&nbsp;$137B&nbsp;ADNV.</li>
</ul>
<p>"During periods of market uncertainty, clients rely on BrokerTec's highly liquid benchmark cash Treasuries and Repo markets," said&nbsp;John Edwards, Global Head of BrokerTec. "Our record volume was driven by trading activity in our cash Repo dealer-to-dealer CLOB, which enables clients to secure short-term funding, manage collateral efficiently, and mitigate risk in volatile times. Ongoing growth in our dealer-to-client RFQ platform, BrokerTec Quote, and momentum in our BrokerTec Stream offering also contributed to this all-time record."</p>

GODIN aims to enhance global data interoperability and accessibility by aligning open data to widely recognized global frameworks like the Global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) System and the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">By embedding LEIs into open data sources, this initiative aims to create a transparent, efficient, and interconnected ecosystem that enhances data utility across the public and private sectors. Open Ownership, a non-profit organization dedicated to beneficial ownership transparency, ensures that governments, businesses, and organizations can access accurate data on corporate ownership and control.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Organizations that join GODIN will gain access to a collaborative network of like-minded organizations, fostering shared expertise, resources, and best practices. They will benefit from improved data interoperability through LEI integration, enhanced accessibility and usability of their open data, and opportunities to co-develop innovative tools and solutions.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Stephen Abbott Pugh, Head of Technology at Open Ownership, adds: &ldquo;Simply publishing open data or endorsing open data principles is not enough to overcome the complexity and fragmentation of the global data ecosystem. By joining forces through GODIN, GLEIF and Open Ownership are advancing the mission of practical and impactful open data usage, driving transparency, risk assessment, and informed decision-making.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, comments: &ldquo;The launch of this initiative marks a significant step toward making open data more connected, accessible, and impactful. By utilizing the LEI as a globally standardized open data connector, we are creating a more transparent and interoperable data ecosystem that benefits businesses and governments everywhere, and supports the growth of the global, digital economy. "</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The joint initiative is inviting governments, non-governmental organizations, non-profits, academic institutions, and private entities with public-facing data initiatives to join as members. Membership is open to all organizations that publish open data or set open data standards. GODIN offers an unparalleled opportunity to shape the future of open data, drive transparency, and create lasting impact.

<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for February 2025.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:<br /></b>&ldquo;While we are not satisfied with our February performance in U.S. credit, we are seeing the benefit of the enhancements we have made to our portfolio trading solution, and the launch of our High Touch block trading solution in Eurobonds and emerging markets. We are also excited about the expected launch of our High Touch block trading solution in the U.S. and our dealer Mid-X protocol on Pragma technology in the second quarter. We believe these new capabilities should help drive higher levels of market share in U.S. credit in the coming quarters. While it is still early in the final month of the quarter, we are encouraged by the recent increase in volatility in the markets and the increase in our U.S. credit trading volumes and estimated market share relative to February 2025 levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Select February 2025 Highlights</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Total average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;) of<b>$43.4 billion</b>increased<b>27%&nbsp;</b>compared to the prior year, and increased<b>11%</b>compared to January 2025 levels.

<li><b>Record</b>emerging markets ADV of<b>$4.1 billion</b>increased<b>13%&nbsp;</b>compared to the prior year, and increased<b>13%</b>compared to January 2025. The year-over-year increase was driven by an<b>11%&nbsp;</b>increase<b>&nbsp;</b>in<b>&nbsp;</b>local currency ADV, and<b>record</b>levels of hard currency ADV which increased<b>13%</b>.

<li>The preliminary FPM for total credit for February 2025 was approximately<b>&nbsp;$143</b>, down from<b>$152</b>in the prior year, but up slightly from<b>$141</b>in January 2025. The decline in total credit FPM year-over-year was due to product and protocol mix. The increase in total credit FPM month-over-month was principally due to the higher duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade, driven by an increase in the weighted average years to maturity.</li>
<li>The preliminary FPM for total rates for February 2025 was<b>&nbsp;</b>approximately<b>&nbsp;$4.29</b>, up from<b>$4.23</b>in the prior year, and up from<b>$4.25</b>in January 2025. The increase in total rates FPM both year-over-year and month-over-month was driven by the impact of product mix within our rates business.</li>

<p>Peak-shaving products are market-based tools that enable market participants to reduce their electricity consumption during peak demand periods in exchange for compensation.</p>

In such cases, Member States can instruct system operators to use peak-shaving products to reduce power demand, helping to stabilise the grid and lower prices.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACER assessment</span></p>
<p>The EMD Regulation mandates ACER to assess the potential impact of developing peak-shaving products on the EU&rsquo;s electricity market under normal market conditions. This assessment should also evaluate whether these products can be introduced without disrupting the functioning of electricity markets or redirecting demand response services towards peak-shaving products.</p>
<p>In February 2025, ACER established an&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPV1cEUlFTU0wKAFdQHVYAVgAdCwlSBBpWUAdRBQJTAAZXUwEdBFQAUgxXBgEdA1gDBR0GAQhSGlRSUlUZV1cCAAkHBQUHVlRXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Expert Group</a>&nbsp;to provide guidance on the topic. To further strengthen its assessment, ACER will gather inputs from stakeholders through a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSU1NQAgIAUkxbAwBbHVZaBQMdC1oGUhpUUgAEBQZTAgMJAAAdBFQAUgxXBgEdA1gDBR0GAQhSGlRSUlUZV1cCAAkHBQUHVlRXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">public consultation</a>&nbsp;from 20 March 2025 until 17 April 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next steps</span></p>
<p>Based on the findings of ACER&rsquo;s assessment (expected in summer 2025), the European Commission may propose amendments to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECQ5XWQNcV0wPVwxUHVYJBVMdUFgJUBpTBAMDUAYNBVMJBAkdBFQAUgxXBgEdA1gDBR0GAQhSGlRSUlUZV1cCAAkHBQUHVlRXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electricity Regulation</a>&nbsp;to introduce peak-shaving products beyond electricity price crisis situations.</p>

<ul>
<li>The total market capitalization of the Equities Market at the end of 2024 was RUB 53.2 trln (USD 523.4 bln). Fee and commission income from the Equities Market was up 44.7%, while trading volumes grew 43.1%. The effective fee was positively affected by the growing volumes of value-added, CCP-based OTC trading. Over 3.6 million clients were active every month during the year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Bond Market increased 24.3% while trading volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) improved by 14.8%. Primary market volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) were up 44.8%, mostly driven by elevated corporate borrowing activity. The supply of floating-rate issues propped up the primary market. However, floating-rate bonds have a lower trading velocity in the secondary market compared to fixed-rate bonds, which is why the secondary market trading volumes decreased by 9.4%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Market fee income was up 35.4%. Trading volumes grew 27.1%. The discrepancy between fees and volumes was mainly attributable to the increase in shares of value-added CCP and GCC repo in the volumes&rsquo; mix. The effective fee was also supported by the increase of average GCC repo terms. The GCC repo segment also benefits from the rising demand for Russian-law money market ETFs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Derivatives Market F&amp;C income increased by 33.5%. The trading volume added 23.7%. The volumes&rsquo; mix evolved towards higher value-added contracts on commodities and interest rates, which had a positive effect on the effective fee. Specifically, commodity derivatives&rsquo; volumes surged by 74.3%. The volumes of interest rate contracts improved by 91.9%. On the other hand, FX derivative contracts decreased by 4.3% in trading volumes. Index contracts trading volumes grew by 47.8%. Single-stock contracts increased by 21.4% in trading volumes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Depository and Settlement Services added 4.4%. Average value of assets under custody increased by 10.5%. The discrepancy between growth rates of F&amp;C income and assets on deposit is the result of business lines beyond safekeeping, primarily clearing and collateral management services, which are a reflection of repo operations at the NSD.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IT Services, Listing and other fee income line was largely driven by Finuslugi revenues. Sale of software and tech. services organically improved by 8.0%. Listing and other services grew by 16.5% as primary market activity in bonds improved. Sales of information services fell by 19.1%. Finuslugi revenues surged by 76.0% as the business unit develops new features, widens the product range and keeps attracting new clients. Other fee income grew by 69.3% on the back of the NCC tariff model update related to precious metals market as well as the launch of new products.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<div class="pr-story--text pr-text-font"><a href="https://sterlingtradingtech.com/">Sterling Trading Tech</a>&nbsp;(&lsquo;Sterling&rsquo;), a leading global provider of technology in order management, risk and margin, and trading, today announced the expansion of its asset class coverage to include fixed income instruments.<br /><br />This strategic expansion further strengthens Sterling&rsquo;s already comprehensive asset class coverage, spanning U.S. and international equities and options, U.S. and international futures, FX, and crypto.<br /><br />Building and maintaining these capabilities internally, while navigating technological, regulatory, data and market developments can be a daunting and resource-intensive challenge for most firms. Sterling provides an efficient and cost-effective solution by offering robust and continuously evolving risk management technology. Clients leveraging the Sterling Risk &amp; Margin (SRM) can now integrate fixed income into their operations with access to:<br /><br />&bull; Market data for sovereign, corporate, convertible, and municipal bonds<br />&bull; U.S. and international market coverage<br />&bull; Closing prices and intraday indicative pricing<br />&bull; Risk shocks for bonds to capture interest rate risk<br />&bull; Account and firm-level interest rate risk with margin calculations for bonds<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;○ Default to FINRA requirements<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;○ Overrides at the company, symbol, and account levels<br />&bull; &nbsp;Interest rate risk of bonds incorporated into Value-at-Risk (VAR) calculations</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pr-story--element-space">
<div class="pr-story-paragraph"><br />
<div class="pr-story--text pr-text-font">This new capability allows clients to assess how fixed income securities contribute to portfolio values and margin requirements and stress-test their securities against interest rate shocks to determine their portfolio risk exposure. Sterling will use standard FINRA margin requirements for fixed income securities while allowing for overrides at the company or account level.<br /><br />In addition to its multi-asset coverage, SRM delivers advanced analytics through a RaaS (Risk-as-a-Service) model, enabling firms to monitor client Reg T, portfolio margin and custom house policy requirements in real-time. Clients gain access to advanced post-execution risk analytics for U.S. and global equities, options and futures along with secure FINRA reporting. SRM seamlessly integrates with the Sterling OMS platform for a unified experience.<br /><br />Said&nbsp;<span>Brian Saldeen, CFA, Senior Product Manager &ndash; Risk &amp; Margin, at Sterling:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Firms must have the tools to effectively manage their risk across all asset classes, especially as yields rise and fixed income exposure increases. We understand their need to measure and mitigate risk in a highly regulated environment. Our approach integrates asset classes, risk exposure, and regulatory compliance into a single, comprehensive offering.&rdquo;<br /><br />Continuing its commitment to innovation and excellence across its product suite, Sterling will also expand capabilities to include mutual funds.</div>

<title>Hong Kong Capital Markets Wrap Up 2024 On A High Note: Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Quarterly Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-capital-markets-wrap-up-2024-on-a-high-note-hong-kong-securities-and-202536/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A strong asset management sector and enhanced market connectivity amidst improving investor sentiment provided Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets with a strong finish to 2024, according to the Securities and Futures Commission&rsquo;s (SFC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/QR-Reports/202410-12/0_SFC_Quarterly-Report_OctDec-2024_ENG.pdf?rev=f606fcbd22de49f1a77c4ef9eb8ecb5f" target="_blank">Quarterly Report</a>&nbsp;published today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the asset management front, the exchange-traded fund (ETFs) market made further headway last year, as the average daily turnover for ETFs surged 35% year-on-year to $18.9 billion (US$2.4 billion), accounting for 14% of total stock market turnover (Note 1). They raked in net inflows of $22.8 billion (US$2.9 billion) for the year, while the number of ETFs increased 11% to 194 (Note 2).</p>
<p>In another sign of the sector&rsquo;s vibrancy, net inflows into Hong Kong-domiciled funds soared 88% to $162.9 billion (US$ 20.9 billion), with their assets under management up by a robust 22% to $1.64 trillion (US$211.4 billion).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the milestone cross-listing of two Hong Kong ETFs in Saudi Arabia in October has boosted regional market connectivity. The two ETFs, the largest in the Saudi market, had a combined market capitalisation of US$1.6 billion as of December.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of ETF Connect enhancements and the listings of several leading Mainland companies in Hong Kong since April 2024, connectivity with Mainland markets was further reinforced as enhancements to the Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds scheme strongly bolstered Hong Kong fund sales after taking effect in January 2025.</p>
<p>Stock Connect, marking a first decade of success, saw a 55% jump in average daily southbound trading to $48.2 billion in 2024, representing more than 18% of Hong Kong market turnover. Southbound net inflows also hit a 10-year high of $807.9 billion, with cumulative inflows nearing $3.7 trillion as of December.</p>
<p>"With the Mainland&rsquo;s comprehensive support for its economy since last September, Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets demonstrated time-tested resilience and enduring appeal to global investors through a challenging year of 2024," said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;Building upon the progress, the SFC will remain committed to facilitating developments and fostering innovation for our markets while upholding their integrity and quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, licensing data continued its upward trend, with the total number of licensed corporations up 1.5% and the number of licence applications up 15% as of end-2024 (Note 3). For virtual assets (VA), the SFC granted licences to three more VA trading platforms in early 2025, bringing the total number to 10. To cement Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a global VA hub, the SFC has recently issued the &ldquo;ASPIRe&rdquo; roadmap clearly setting out 12 major initiatives (Note 4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To step up investor education and combat investment fraud, the SFC in December launched a fresh anti-scam publicity campaign titled &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be Sucker&rdquo; through a catchy rap song, a music video, a new Instagram account and advertisements on both online and traditional media. The music video recorded more than 78,000 views on the campaign&rsquo;s dedicated YouTube channel in the first two months since launch. The campaign focuses on the common scam scenarios of online romance&nbsp;scams, impersonation and deceptive tips from financial influencers (Note 5).</p>
<p>The SFC also continued to prudently manage its financial health, which is key to ensuring its sustainability as Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital market regulator. It is pleased to report a modest surplus of $77 million for the last quarter, as Hong Kong&rsquo;s stock market turnover rebounded upon the Mainland&rsquo;s economic support measures.</p>
<p>The quarterly report is available on the SFC website.</p>

<title>Derivatives Market Institute For Standards Annual Report Outlines Successes Of 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Derivatives Market Institute for Standards released its&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12rsk2tsu0mXsjpUWfdqiXZFEOhinP" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">2024 annual report</a></strong><span>, highlighting several accomplishments achieved last year.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Developed the 30-30-30 standard implementation guide</li>
<li>Published the average pricing standard</li>
<li>Created the planning/strategy working group</li>
<li>Received proposals from non-DMIST members&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<p>DMIST developed the implementation guide for the "30-30-30&rdquo; standard (Timeliness of Trade Operations and Give Ups). As members have adopted this standard, it has resulted in tangible improvements. Some firms are reporting trade-date allocation completion rates of 95-97% &ndash; even as market volume has increased &ndash; mitigating risk across the ecosystem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud of the significant progress we achieved in 2024. The exchange-traded derivatives industry has united to implement and realize the benefits of operational standards, driving meaningful improvements in efficiency and risk reduction,&rdquo; said Samina Anwar, DMIST sponsor board chair and global derivatives operations senior director at Cargill.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Following feedback from the industry via a consultation process, DMIST published its average pricing standard in June 2024, with an implementation guide to follow in the first half of 2025. This will provide a roadmap for clearinghouses setting up a system to average price trades. It will enable brokers to connect more efficiently to a system that follows a global standard. And technology vendors can more rapidly and cost-effectively develop systems using functionality agreed upon by a broad constituency.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The standards body also established the DMIST planning/strategy working group to actively monitor emerging trends such as tokenization, US Treasury clearing, etc. and identify areas where industry-wide operational standards can drive further advancements.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;DMIST has achieved our goal of creating an open, collaborative environment for sharing information across market participants. DMIST members have come together to seek solutions to industry inefficiencies. We have executing and clearing brokers, exchanges and clearinghouses, clients and technology providers working together to understand the issues and propose workable standards,&rdquo; said Don Byron, executive director of DMIST.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>DMIST also received proposals for standards from non-DMIST members for the first time in 2024. The FIA Operations Americas Division and the FIA European and Asian Operations Committees submitted a proposal to standardize position transfers. DMIST published that consultation paper January 17, 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The FIA European and US eTrading Committee submitted a proposal to standardize aspects of self-match prevention. These detailed proposals described the problem, offered recommendations, and identified the significant benefits the proposed standard would achieve. The DMIST Sponsor Board accepted both proposals.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FINRA&rsquo;s Board of Governors met on February 25-26. The agenda included electing a new Board Chair, as well as discussions on FINRA&rsquo;s proposed Outside Business Activities rule, TRACE&nbsp;<a>reporting timeframes</a>, ongoing technology initiatives, and the proposed allocation of FINRA&rsquo;s 2024 fine monies.</p>

<p><br /><a>Eric Noll is stepping down as Chair to pursue an opportunity that would conflict with his role as a Public Governor. To succeed him,</a>&nbsp;the Board elected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors/scott-a-curtis">Scott A. Curtis</a>, who has served as a Governor and Large Firm Representative since 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an honor and privilege to chair the FINRA Board of Governors,&rdquo; said Noll, who had served as Chair since 2022. &ldquo;I am extremely proud of the work the Board has done in furthering FINRA&rsquo;s mission of protecting investors and ensuring market integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are incredibly grateful to Eric for his commitment to FINRA and our mission. His leadership and guidance have been vital as FINRA has continued to adapt and improve our policies and programs in pace with our dynamic capital markets and industry,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives">FINRA CEO Robert Cook</a>. &ldquo;I look forward to working with Scott, whose breadth of financial knowledge and leadership experience will be invaluable in his new role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curtis has been Chief Operating Officer of Raymond James Financial since 2024. Prior to that, he had been President of the firm&rsquo;s Private Client Group since 2018, leading the firm&rsquo;s domestic wealth management business. He has served the firm in senior leadership roles since 2003. Curtis earned his M.B.A. from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and received a B.A. in Economics and English from Denison University.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited to continue building upon the work Eric led in providing strategic guidance for FINRA&rsquo;s essential role of protecting investors and safeguarding the integrity of the capital markets,&rdquo; said Curtis. &ldquo;I look forward to working with the other Governors and FINRA&rsquo;s leadership team in this new capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Board Actions and Updates</strong></p>
<p>The Board appointed two new members to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/adjudication-decisions/national-adjudicatory-council-nac/members">National Adjudicatory Council</a>, a committee that reviews initial decisions rendered in FINRA disciplinary and membership proceedings: Richard Kuhlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Cambridge Investment Research, Inc. (Large Firm NAC Member); and Trinity Lee, President and Executive Director, Heim, Young &amp; Associates, Inc. (Small Firm NAC member).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/adjudication-decisions/national-adjudicatory-council-nac"></a>Their engagement will provide essential support to FINRA&rsquo;s regulatory processes; we welcome the new members and look forward to their input.</p>
<p>As is customary for the first meeting of the year, the Board approved the allocation of prior-year fine monies to various capital initiatives in accordance with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf" target="_blank">FINRA&rsquo;s Financial Guiding Principles</a>. Fines are collected and accounted for separately from monies designated in FINRA&rsquo;s operating budget, and their use is subject to special governance procedures, use restrictions and transparency requirements. As part of FINRA&rsquo;s financial transparency, the details about the allocations will be released in the upcoming Report on the Use of 2024 Fine Monies.</p>
<p>The Board received a briefing on the examinations and investigations programs, including an update on an initiative to modernize the technology used by FINRA&rsquo;s examination staff.</p>
<p>Consistent with FINRA&rsquo;s commitment to continuously improving its regulatory standards, the Board considered rule proposals to modernize requirements and eliminate unnecessary burdens while maintaining investor protection and market integrity:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Board approved the publication of a Regulatory Notice soliciting comment on a revised proposed Rule 3290 (Outside Activities Requirements) to replace FINRA Rules&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3270">3270</a>&nbsp;(Outside Business Activities of Registered Persons) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3280">3280</a>&nbsp;(Private Securities Transactions of an Associated Person). The revised proposal would replace two rules with a single rule that provides clarity and reduces unnecessary compliance burdens for member firms in reviewing outside activities of their associated persons.</li>
<li>The Board also considered updates to the TRACE reporting timeframes, to reduce undue operational burdens and complexity consistent with Cook&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/blog/updating-trace-reporting-timeframes">recent blog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<title>SIFMA AMG Statement On The FDIC Withdrawal Of Bank “Control” Rule Proposal</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA&rsquo;s Asset Management Group (SIFMA AMG) today issued the following statement from Lindsey Keljo, Head of SIFMA AMG, in response to the FDIC formally withdrawing the Change in Bank Control Act proposal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA commends the FDIC for taking this appropriate action. As we have consistently advocated, we believe the FDIC&rsquo;s current approach to assessing &lsquo;control&rsquo; under the Change in Bank Control Act has worked well and is not in need of reevaluation. The changes previously under consideration could have serious unintended consequences, including a detrimental impact on banks&rsquo; access to capital. The current approach among banking regulators has worked well and has avoided unnecessary and costly regulation that is ultimately borne by markets and investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millions of Americans save for retirement and other financial goals with the help of funds managed by asset managers. Investors benefit from economies of scale and are paying lower fees than ever before. Such funds provide investors with exposure to many sectors of the economy, including banking, and as such, are an important source of capital for the sector. Any reevaluation of asset managers&rsquo; investments in FDIC-supervised institutions must be thoughtful and designed to avoid limiting banks&rsquo; access to capital or investors&rsquo; ability to save for their financial goals.&nbsp; To do otherwise risks unduly disincentivizing investment in banks and increasing the cost of investment for retail investors in the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Fees To Validate Pro Forma Models Under The European Market Infrastructure Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on fees to be paid by financial and non-financial counterparties requiring the validation of pro forma models under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). The consultation runs until 7 April 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>​</span>Under EMIR, the EBA is granted the new role as central validator of pro forma models for the whole European Union. Pro forma models, such as ISDA SIMM, are used by the industry to calculate initial margin. To perform this new role, the EBA will charge financial and non-financial counterparties an annual fee per each validated pro forma model. The fees are expected to cover the costs incurred by the EBA in performing this role as central validator.</p>
<p>The discussion paper outlines the EBA budgeting approach and the main estimated costs for the performance of the tasks as central validator. In particular, it proposes calculation methods for the fees to be charged to counterparties and specifies practical aspects such as the fees modalities of payment.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "Send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 7 April 2025. All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, background and next steps</h4>
<p>Article 11(12a) of EMIR mandates the EBA to set up a central validation function for the elements and general aspects of pro forma models, and changes thereto, used or to be used by financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties. The EBA shall charge an annual fee, per pro forma model, to financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties using the pro forma models validated by EBA.</p>
<p>On 31 July 2024, the EBA received a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/3ac62522-3ab8-4a7e-be35-47005bf4e460/EMIR%203_0%20-%20Fees%20-%20EBA%20mandate%20%28Art_%2011%2812%29%29%20-%20provisional%20mandate.pdf">Call for advice on a possible Delegated Act on fees</a>&nbsp;with the request to submit its response by Q2 2025. The EBA is requested to &lsquo;widely consult market participants&rsquo; as part of its response.</p>
<p>The feedback received from this consultation will help the EBA finalise its response to the European Commission&rsquo;s call for advice on a possible Delegated Act on fees.</p>

<title>UK Prudential Regulation Authority Consults On Raising Leverage Ratio Threshold To £70 Billion Retail Deposits</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-consults-on-raising-leverage-ratio-threshold-202535/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-consults-on-raising-leverage-ratio-threshold-202535/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="page-section">
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is consulting on changing the retail deposits leverage ratio threshold to &pound;70 billion &ndash; an increase of &pound;20 billion.</p>
<p>The leverage ratio is designed to give a simple percentage indicator of how much capital a firm has to fund its activities. The PRA currently requires firms with over &pound;50 billion in retail deposits or &pound;10 billion of non-UK assets to meet a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% plus buffers. These thresholds took effect in 2016 and 2023 respectively, and are designed to capture major UK banks, building societies and investment firms.</p>
<p>The PRA is now proposing to raise the retail deposits threshold, increasing it to &pound;70 billion to reflect nominal GDP growth since 2016. This increase would ensure that the threshold continued to capture major UK firms, whilst smaller firms below the new threshold would have more space to grow before becoming subject to the leverage ratio requirement.</p>
<p>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and CEO of the PRA said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guarding against excessive leverage in our banking system is essential for economic stability, but we should achieve that in a proportionate way. Today&rsquo;s proposals will support growth and innovation by giving smaller banks more space to grow before entering the leverage regime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PRA is not proposing changes to the &pound;10 billion non-UK asset threshold, which was implemented much more recently than the retail deposits threshold, and continues to operate as intended.</p>

<title>Lithos Selects Puro.earth To Certify Its Enhanced Rock Weathering Carbon Removal Credits</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lithos-selects-puroearth-to-certify-its-enhanced-rock-weathering-carbon-removal-202535/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Puro.earth, the world's leading carbon crediting platform for engineered carbon removal, has announced that Lithos Carbon, a pioneer in Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) technology, has selected Puro.earth to certify its carbon removal credits under the globally recognized Puro Standard for engineered carbon dioxide removal (CDR).</p>
<p>Lithos Carbon utilizes ERW, a process that accelerates the natural weathering of rocks to capture and store atmospheric CO2. Lithos repurposes finely crushed, nutrient-rich volcanic rock&mdash;a waste byproduct of the aggregate and mining industries&mdash;to enhance the soil&rsquo;s ability to absorb carbon dioxide while simultaneously improving soil health and crop yields. Lithos Carbon&rsquo;s work focuses on the cost-effective scale-up of efficient supply chains while rigorously quantifying that ex-post carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere has been achieved.</p>
<p>Through the certification process, Lithos' carbon removal will be rigorously evaluated against the Puro Standard methodology for ERW to ensure compliance with its stringent criteria for durability, measurability, and scalability. Lithos joins Puro.earth's leading network of over 250 carbon removal suppliers and upon certification will be able to offer CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs) to corporate buyers issued in the Puro Registry.</p>
<p><span><i>"Pursuing certification through Puro.earth is a natural next step and significant milestone for Lithos,&rdquo;</i></span>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Mary Yap, CEO of Lithos.</b>&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already demonstrated our data-driven solution&rsquo;s impact in the carbon market, enabling widespread adoption among diverse farmland partners. But partnering with Puro.earth, an organization renowned for its exacting standards across pathways from biochar to Direct Air Capture, will further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our proven methodology and help us scale the high standards expected by carbon buyers in a market driven by trust and transparency.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p>Lithos aims to remove millions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere annually through its ERW technology. The company works closely with farmers to implement its solution, creating a win-win scenario that combines carbon removal with agricultural benefits.</p>
<p><span><i>&ldquo;We are honored to work with Lithos as they pioneer innovation in enhanced rock weathering (ERW) for carbon removal,&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></span>said&nbsp;<b>Antti Vihavainen, Vice Chairman of Puro.earth.</b>&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;Their cutting-edge approach, which leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to maximize CO₂ capture and agricultural benefits, is paving the way for significant climate impact using ERW. With the largest-ever rock weathering carbon removal purchase secured&mdash;$57.1 million for 154,240 tons of CO₂ removal&mdash;Lithos has demonstrated both scientific leadership and strong market validation."</i></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets platform services provider,&nbsp;today announced the promotion of Justin Llewellyn-Jones to CEO, effective March 31. After three decades of experience in fintech and financial services, Llewellyn-Jones joined Trading Technologies as Chief Operating Officer in January 2024. Current CEO Keith Todd will remain on the Board of Directors and be appointed Deputy Chairman.</p>
<p>Carsten Kengeter, Chairman of TT and CEO of 7RIDGE, said: &ldquo;As CEO, Keith impressively led TT to achieve all goals set out in its five-year plan in just three years. We now look forward to the next chapter, as the new CEO, Justin, will rely on his proven track record of success throughout his 30-year career and benefit from his past year at TT working with Keith. Since 2022, TT has solidified its leadership in listed derivatives, established a footprint across additional asset classes, acquired and integrated four complementary companies, and launched six lines of business to further diversify and fuel growth. I expect TT's record-breaking growth will continue as Justin and Keith perform their new roles.&rdquo;<i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Todd said: &ldquo;Over the last several years, I have been privileged to serve our extraordinary clients during a period of massive change under 7RIDGE&rsquo;s ownership of TT. We have built an extremely talented global team and put in place a highly experienced leadership group focused on delivering superior quality services to our customers. We&rsquo;ve doubled the size of the business in just three years and, as we are setting off on our new five-year plan, it is appropriate to hand over the CEO role to Justin, whose deep industry experience and professionalism make him the ideal and natural successor. I thank all clients, partners and employees for their support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Llewellyn-Jones said: &ldquo;Thanks to Keith&rsquo;s extraordinary leadership and the talented team we have built here at TT, we are now positioned for continued growth and outperformance. TT is laser-focused on our customers and partners, and there is a tremendous opportunity for us to support the acceleration of their growth as we drive innovation and digitization through our platform. I&rsquo;m very excited about our current trajectory and intend to stay the course on the fundamentals of our vision and strategy, while recognizing we must remain agile in a constantly evolving landscape, and that our work on continuous process improvement and service excellence is never done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eurex, Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and &ndash; along with Eurex Clearing &ndash; one of the leading central counterparties globally, reported a 12 percent increase in total trading volume for February, reaching 173.0 million contracts compared to 154.6 million contracts in the same month last year. This growth was mainly fueled by a 25 percent rise in equity derivatives, which surged from 19.9 million to 24.9 million contracts. Interest rate derivatives experienced a 14 percent increase, climbing to 88.3 million contracts. Additionally, index derivatives rose by 3 percent, from 57.1 million to 58.8 million contracts.<br />&nbsp;<br />In OTC Clearing, notional outstanding volumes rose by 17 percent in February, reaching EUR 39,776 billion, compared to EUR 33,882 billion in the same month last year. Notional outstanding for overnight index swaps saw a 30 percent increase to EUR 4,553 billion, while interest rate swaps grew by 16 percent to EUR 16,783 billion.</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, maintained its upward trajectory with a 14 percent rise in daily GC Pooling volumes, reaching EUR 147.0 billion compared to 129.3 billion in February 2024. However, the repo market experienced a 26 percent decline, dropping from EUR 218.5 billion in February 2024 to EUR 161.1 billion in February 2025, due to persistent unfavorable market environment and reduced demand.</p>

<title>Voluntary Carbon Markets Found To Be Over 10 Times Less Efficient Than Mainstream Markets, WFE Research Reveals</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/voluntary-carbon-markets-found-to-be-over-10-times-less-efficient-than-mainstrea-202535/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/voluntary-carbon-markets-found-to-be-over-10-times-less-efficient-than-mainstrea-202535/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (The WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and CCPs, has published new research today, the first study examining the dynamics of the primary markets in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM).&nbsp;<br /><br />The WFE Research paper analyses a comprehensive dataset of carbon offset projects with vintage years from 1996 until 31 December 2024 across the four major voluntary registries. The paper, titled &ldquo;The dynamics of global voluntary carbon markets: An empirical analysis of the carbon credits lifecycle&rdquo;, authored by Dr Ying Liu and Dr Pedro Gurrola-P&eacute;rez, finds:<br /><br /><strong>Carbon credit issuance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On average it takes 2.5 years from the year when the CO2 emission reduction or removal took place (known as the vintage year) to issue a carbon credit, compared, for example, to the 8-12 weeks it typically takes to issue a green bond.</li>
<li>Average issuance time is decreasing, but it still exceeds 2010 levels, reflecting the market&rsquo;s struggle to adapt to increased supply.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This lag varies across project scope and registries. Carbon credit issuance for chemical process projects have the fastest issuance time, while issuance for transport projects takes the longest.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Carbon Credit retirement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On average, the duration from credit vintage year to retirement (the point at which the holder of the credit claims the offset of carbon credits against its own carbon emissions) is 4.4 years.</li>
<li>Retirement age is characterised by an uptrend from 2015 to 2021, implying that investors were purchasing older credits (or credits with an earlier vintage year) during this period. This reflects both changes in investor preference, and the longer issuance time during the period, which made credits older by the time they were ready to be traded.</li>
<li>Household &amp; Community projects exhibit the shortest retirement age at 3 years, and Carbon Capture &amp; Storage projects take the longest at 9 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Market participants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proportional demand for credits from large end-users, particularly from the top ten retirement beneficiaries, has declined by roughly 27 percentage points since 2010. This shift indicates a more diversified investor base with increased participation from a broader range of market participants.</li>
<li>Over 54% of retirements are of sizes smaller than 10 tCO2e, with a mean quantity of retired credits of 2,730 tCO2e, suggesting a substantial participation from medium and small buyers of credits.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>*All data as of 31st December 2024.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges, said,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The WFE&rsquo;s research shows the key issues that need to be addressed if the global carbon market framework, as agreed at COP29, is to be successful. The results show that VCMs currently lack the resilience and efficiency that investors experience on established mainstream markets. Regulated exchanges, already operating successful markets, will play a significant role in improving the functioning of VCMs, bringing their experience of running regulated public markets over the centuries. There is work to do: increasing standardisation of the markets, providing an infrastructure that stimulates efficient price formation, improving the levels of transparency and ensuring investor protection is enshrined at the heart of the VCM model. At COP29, the world took an important step forward with the international carbon market, but it won&rsquo;t live up to its promise if these issues aren&rsquo;t addressed. WFE Members will lead the way.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-P&eacute;rez, Head of Research at the World Federation of Exchanges, said,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The lag in carbon credit issuance is correlated with the number of new projects, which suggests that the increase in the lag is linked to the difficulties in scaling up the monitoring-verification cycle. In other words, the reduction in issuance time we observe in recent years may not be because processes are somehow improving, but more likely because supply has slowed down. The research also shows that since 2021 VCM growth has stalled. While retirement of credits is diversifying, the findings show a decrease in the proportion of participation from large investors, who are crucial to ensuring efficient secondary trading. To attract large investors, these markets need to become more automated and standardised.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />The WFE will host a webinar to present the findings of the research on 10th March at 1pm GMT. The WFE will convene stakeholders to discuss how exchanges can promote and enable sustainability within the financial ecosystem in Singapore on June 5, at the industry&rsquo;s annual ESG meeting.<br /><br />Read the full paper&nbsp;<strong><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=b9bef00867&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Growth Of Private Markets Requires Continued Focus On Valuations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA's review of private market valuation processes has found good practice but some room for improvement.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Private markets have grown significantly in recent years with the UK continuing to be the largest centre for private market asset management in Europe.</p>
<p>Private market assets don&rsquo;t have the frequent trading and regular price discovery present in more liquid public markets, so robust valuation practices are important for fairness and confidence in private markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA recently completed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/private-market-valuation-practices" title="Private market valuation practices">multi-firm assessment</a>&nbsp;of valuation practices and governance for valuing private equity, venture capital, private debt, and infrastructure assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms generally demonstrated good practice in areas such as investor reporting, process documentation and use of third-party valuation advisers, and were consistently applying valuation methodologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the FCA found areas where firms need to improve. These included the need for better identification and documentation of potential conflicts of interest in the valuation process, and increased independence within firms&rsquo; own valuation processes.</p>
<p>The FCA also found that some firms needed to enhance processes for ad hoc valuations in times of market disruption.</p>
<p>Improvements in these areas are particularly important with growing retail investor exposure to private assets.</p>
<p>Camille Blackburn, director of wholesale buy-side at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'The UK is the largest centre for private asset management in Europe. Investor demand from individuals and institutions has driven significant growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Good valuation practices are key to maintaining fairness and confidence as the market grows. We were pleased that firms could usually evidence independence, expertise, transparency and consistency in their valuation process.</p>
<p>'There is still more to do, and we expect firms to carefully consider our findings.'</p>
<p>The findings will be used in the FCA's review of Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) as it updates its rules in the Handbook and will inform the FCA&rsquo;s contribution to IOSCO&rsquo;s review of global valuation standards to support the use of proportionate and consistent valuation standards globally in private markets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the FCA's review of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/private-market-valuation-practices" title="Private market valuation practices">private market valuation practices</a>.</li>
<li>While the FCA did not independently validate firms&rsquo; fair value assessments, they selected valuation case studies to see how firms valued specific assets over time to understand the valuation process in practice.</li>
<li>The review focused on private market assets using Level 3 inputs under IFRS 13 and ASC 820, which require significant judgement and impact investment decisions.</li>
<li>The findings are relevant to UK firms and international stakeholders as global valuation standards continue to evolve.&nbsp;</li>

<title>Global Terrorism Index 2025: Terrorism Spreads As Lone Wolf Attacks Dominate The West</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/global-terrorism-index-2025-terrorism-spreads-as-lone-wolf-attacks-dominate-th-202535/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The number of countries recording a terrorist attack increased from 58 to 66, according to the 12th annual Global Terrorism Index (GTI) released today. This reverses nearly a decade of improvements, with 45 countries deteriorating and 34 improving. The four deadliest terrorist groups intensified their violence in 2024, driving an 11% rise in fatalities. In the West, lone wolf attacks now dominate, accounting for 93% of fatal attacks over the past five years.</p>
<p><b>Key Findings:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The Sahel region remains terrorism's epicentre, accounting for over half of all global terrorism deaths</li>
<li>Islamic State (IS) expands its operations to 22 countries and remains the deadliest organisation, causing 1,805 deaths, with 71% of its activity being in Syria and DRC</li>
<li>Tehrik-e-Taliban (TTP) emerged as fastest-growing terrorist group, with 90% increase in attributed deaths</li>
<li>Deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding the Sahel) are now at their lowest since 2016, dropping by 10%</li>
<li>Terrorist attacks jumped by 63% in the West, Europe was most affected where attacks doubled to 67</li>
<li>In 2024, several Western countries reported one in five terror suspects as under 18, with teenagers accounting for most IS-linked arrests in Europe</li>
<li>Seven Western countries are in the first 50 most impacted countries on the GTI</li>
<li>Antisemitic and Islamophobic hate surged globally, with the US seeing a 200% rise in antisemitic incidents in 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gaza conflict has intensified instability in the Middle East and is fuelling hate crimes in the West, while terrorism deaths surged in Iran. Global terrorism deaths remained constant in 2024, after allowing for the October 7 attack.&nbsp;The four deadliest terrorist groups escalated their violence, causing an 11% rise in terrorism fatalities. The most deaths from terrorism were in Burkina Faso, Pakistan and Syria. Burkina Faso is responsible for one fifth of all deaths globally.</p>
<p>Islamic State (IS) remains the deadliest organisation, causing 1,805 deaths across 22 countries in 2024, one more than the prior year. IS was most active in Syria and the DRC. IS Khorasan Province (ISK) has emerged into one of the most active jihadist groups worldwide, conducting major attacks in Iran and Russia. Since 2020, ISK has expanded from one&nbsp;country to five, producing propaganda in nine languages. Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is the fastest-growing terrorist organisation, with deaths rising 90% to 558.</p>
<p>The GTI is produced by international think tank the Institute for Economics &amp; Peace (IEP) and has been published annually for the last 12 years. It is the most comprehensive resource on global terrorism trends and uses multiple factors to calculate its score, including the number of incidences, fatalities, injuries and hostage numbers, before combining these with conflict and socioeconomic data to provide a holistic picture of terrorism.</p>
<p><b>Steve Killelea, Founder &amp; Executive Chairman, IEP:</b>&nbsp;<i>"This year's Global Terrorism Index highlights two key concerns; firstly, 98% of all terrorist deaths occurred in conflict zones, with 2024 recording the highest number of conflicts since the end of the WWII. Secondly, social tensions and dissatisfaction within the West are fuelling lone actor terrorism. 93% of all fatal terrorist attacks were caused by lone actors. The best way to control terrorism is to stop or reduce the number of conflicts. In addition, the Gaza conflict has been, and still is, a catalyst for antisemitism and Islamophobia."</i></p>
<p><b>Western nations face new terror landscape</b><br /><br />The majority of Western attacks are now carried out by individuals without formal group affiliations, who radicalise through social media, gaming platforms and encrypted messaging apps. The shift towards online radicalisation has enabled potential terrorists to access extremist content, and organise with minimal physical contact. Algorithmic radicalisation on popular social media sites can drive users toward progressively more extreme content over time.</p>
<p>The West saw its first major rise in terrorist incidents since 2017, with attacks increasing from 32 to 52. Sweden, Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland registered their first attacks in more than five years. Germany was Europe's worst-performing nation, placing 27th globally following the Magdeburg Christmas market attack.</p>
<p>In the UK, under-18s accounted for 42% of 219 terror arrests last year<sup>[1],</sup>&nbsp;reflecting a broader Western trend where youths account for one in five terror suspects. They typically lack ties to established groups and can combine contradictory extremist ideologies.</p>
<p><b>Sahel remains global terrorism epicentre</b></p>
<p>Terrorism in the Sahel has increased significantly, with deaths rising nearly tenfold since 2009. Weak governance, ethnic tensions, and ecological degradation have created a conducive environment in which terrorism can flourish. The Sahel accounts for 51% of 2024's terrorism deaths, with Burkina Faso, while improving overall, remained the most affected nation for a second year. Six of the ten countries in the region recorded at least one fatality. Togo recorded its worst year for terrorism since the inception of the Index, reflecting the spread of terrorist activity beyond the Sahel.</p>
<p>Competition over the region's mineral resources has contributed to ongoing instability. Gold is a major flashpoint in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Niger supplies more than 25% of European uranium. Russian presence has grown significantly in the region while France is withdrawing.</p>
<p>Niger illustrates the fragility of progress in the region. After achieving the second-largest improvement in 2022, it experienced a reversal in the last two years, recording a 94% increase in terrorism deaths to 930 fatalities in 2024, the largest surge globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Terrorism in the Middle East</b></p>
<p>Although the Middle East recorded a 7% reduction in terrorist attacks in 2024 to 618, the resurgence of violence between Israel and Palestine continues to destabilise the region. Both Israel and Syria ranked among the ten most impacted countries globally.</p>
<p>Since 2020, traditional foreign influence in Syria has diminished, with Russia, China, and Iran reducing their roles while Turkey emerges as a dominant regional power. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), once a key partner of the US in the fight against IS, now faces mounting challenges. Turkey's opposition to a strengthened SDF, coupled with the potential scaling back of US support, has created conditions that IS could exploit to regain influence. The new US administration's position on the SDF is still unclear.</p>
<p><b>Hate speech and the US</b></p>
<p>Hate crimes escalated sharply for both the Jewish and Muslim communities in the US following the Gaza war, with FBI-recorded incidents targeting the Jewish community rising by 270% in just two months. Anti-Muslim hate increased at a similar rate, with reported incidents of Islamophobia rising by 300% in the same period. Similar patterns emerged in Europe and Australia, with 31% of all Western attacks motivated by antisemitic or anti-Israel sentiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the US bucked the trend of other Western countries in 2024, with only one death from three attacks, 2025 will be a worse year. The January attack in New Orleans where an IS-pledged individual killed 15 people highlights that concerns remain about a resurgence of terrorist activity. Globally there were a total of 24 foiled plots linked to IS or affiliated groups, including a high-profile plot targeting Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, but it is likely that many more were prevented.</p>
<p><b>Terror groups exploit technology surge</b></p>
<p>Terrorist organisations are rapidly adapting to emerging technologies, transforming their operations through artificial intelligence and encrypted communications. Intelligence&nbsp;agencies report that ISK has markedly expanded its digital arsenal, producing AI-enhanced video content and sophisticated online magazines in multiple languages.</p>
<p>The group deploys encrypted messaging platforms and cryptocurrency for fundraising, whilst using AI to create localised propaganda aimed at foreign targets. Their reach now spans from Central Asia to North America, demonstrating how digital platforms have reshaped terrorist recruitment and operations.</p>
<p>This technological evolution poses new challenges for security services, as extremists increasingly exploit encrypted apps and dark web forums for radicalisation and operational planning. AI also creates opportunities for intelligence services to analyse larger amounts of information, and detect radicalisation earlier.</p>

<title>Oral Reply To Singapore Parliamentary Question On The Tightening Of Regulations For Digital Payment Token Service Providers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/oral-reply-to-singapore-parliamentary-question-on-the-tightening-of-regulations-202535/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Date: For Parliament Sitting on 5 March 2025</span><br /><br /><span>Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament<br /></span><br />Mr Yip Hon Weng, MP, Yio Chu Kang SMC<br /><br /><span>Question</span><br /><br /><span>To ask the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what are the Government's key considerations in deciding to tighten regulations for digital payment token service providers, including the prohibition of payments via locally issued credit cards; and (b) what is the anticipated impact on younger consumers, particularly those aged 18 to 25, who are increasingly adopting the use of cryptocurrencies.<br /></span><br /><span>Answer by Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Board member of MAS, on behalf of Mr Gan Kim Yong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, and Chairman of MAS:</span></p>
<p>1.<span> </span>Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative in nature, and are usually not anchored on any fundamental value. MAS has consistently issued public warnings that dealing in cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />2.<span> </span>If an individual uses his credit card to purchase cryptocurrencies, he could be borrowing from the credit card, which attracts a higher rate of interest than other forms of credit. If the value of the cryptocurrency falls, he may suffer substantial losses and be unable to pay off his credit card debt, with the higher rate of interest compounding his debt.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />3.<span> </span>More generally, using credit or leverage magnifies losses, and investors can lose more than the principal amount they put in. MAS has therefore prohibited digital payment token service providers from providing credit or leverage to all retail customers, regardless of age, for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. This includes restrictions on their acceptance of credit cards.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.<span> </span>MAS cautions that regulatory measures cannot insulate consumers from losses associated with the inherently speculative and highly risky nature of cryptocurrencies. Consumers should stay clear of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Announces Allegations Of Fraud Against Jason Cloth And Creative Wealth Media Finance Corp.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today announces fraud allegations against Jason Cloth and Creative Wealth Media Finance Corp.</span></p>
<p>The OSC alleges Cloth, a Toronto resident, and Creative Wealth raised over $500 million from investors across Ontario, Canada and the U.S., by holding themselves out as providing loans to film, television and animation producers for studio and independent productions. However, Cloth and Creative Wealth are alleged to have diverted at least $70 million of investor funds for unauthorized uses, including to a real estate development and other projects, as well as repaying existing investors. Creative Wealth eventually collapsed into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>According to the allegations, this dishonest conduct harmed investors and undermined the integrity of the capital markets.</p>
<p>A case management hearing will be held before the Capital Markets Tribunal on April 4<span>th</span>&nbsp;at 10:00 a.m. A copy of the Application for Enforcement Proceedings is available on the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/en/notices/notice-ontario-securities-commission-v-cloth-file-no-2025-5" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Capital Markets Tribunal website</a>.</p>
<p><span>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a><span>.</span></p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer Farmer Sentiment Rises As Current Conditions Improve On U.S. Farms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>U.S. farmer sentiment continued its upward trend in February, as the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4374289-1&amp;h=982930118&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;rose 11 points from the previous month to a reading of 152. The boost was primarily driven by the stronger sentiment among producers, with the Current Conditions Index climbing 28 points to 137 &mdash; marking a significant rebound from its low of 76 in late summer and early fall 2024. In contrast, the Future Expectations Index saw only a modest increase, rising 3 points to 159. The recent upswing in sentiment reflects a combination of factors, including a sharp recovery in crop prices, expectations for disaster payments authorized by Congress and continued strength in the U.S. livestock sector. Despite the notable improvement in current conditions, farmers remain more optimistic about the future, as the Future Expectations Index continues to outpace the Current Conditions Index by 22 points. This month's survey was conducted between&nbsp;Feb. 10-14.</p>
<p>The Farm Capital Investment Index jumped 11 points in February to a reading of 59, reaching its most positive level since&nbsp;May 2021. This month's increase also placed the index 4 points above its November postelection reading. Compared to previous months, where future expectations primarily led investment sentiment, February's increase was driven by farmers' improved assessment of current conditions. Meanwhile, the Farm Financial Performance Index held steady at 110, nearly unchanged from January's reading of 111. Although the index saw little movement this month, it remains well above last fall's low of 68.</p>
<p>The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index modestly increased in February to 118, a 3-point increase from January and 8 points higher than December. This month's reading was also 3 points above its level from a year ago and nearly the same as two years ago. While producers remain less optimistic about farmland values than they were during the winters of 2021 and 2022, sentiment has improved compared to the more cautious outlook seen in late summer and early fall 2024.</p>
<p>"While sentiment about the future remains strong, as reflected in the Future Expectations Index, there's growing interest in making larger investments in farm operations, suggesting that farmers are feeling more confident about their ability to grow despite the challenges ahead," said&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4374289-1&amp;h=2984846337&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Langemeier</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4374289-1&amp;h=2928318016&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Each February, the barometer survey asks producers about their five-year growth expectations for their farm operations. In the 2025 survey, 50% of respondents indicated they either have "no plans to grow" (37%) or "plan to exit or retire" (13%), nearly unchanged from 52% in 2024. Since 2016, the share of producers in these two categories has ranged from a low of 43% in 2016 to a high of 61% in 2022. This year's biggest shift came from a decline in the percentage of producers expecting slow growth (less than 5%) and a corresponding increase in those anticipating higher growth rates. Nineteen percent of respondents noted expectations for their farm to grow by 10% to 15% or more annually &mdash; more than double the 9% who projected similar growth last year.</p>
<p>Policies impacting agriculture are top of mind for U.S. farmers. Sixty-two percent of survey respondents in February indicated that passing a new farm bill in 2025 is either "important" (25%) or "very important" (47%). When asked about the most crucial policies for their farm over the next five years, 44% cited "trade policy" as their top concern, followed by "crop insurance program" at 18%. Concerns about trade policy were also evident when producers were asked about the likelihood of a "trade war" that results in a significant drop in U.S. agricultural exports. Forty-eight percent of farmers in this month's survey believe a trade war is either "likely" (29%) or "very likely" (19%).</p>
<p>"While the current outlook for U.S. agriculture has improved, farmers are closely watching trade policy and the potential for a new farm bill, both of which are key factors shaping their long-term expectations," said Langemeier. "These ongoing policy concerns will likely play a critical role in shaping producer sentiment in the months ahead."</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ittai Ben Zeev, CEO of TASE, said today:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;TASE presents a strong performance this year, reflecting the resilience of the Israeli economy in this challenging year. TASE&rsquo;s flagship indices were particularly strong in 2024, outperforming the leading global indices. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange took a leap forward this year as an attractive alternative for foreign investors, reinforcing its competitive standing among leading international exchanges. Even against the backdrop of the ongoing war on multiple fronts, TASE has demonstrated its strength, attracting capital while also serving as a major source for debt raising by the public companies and the government. The indices&rsquo; performance this year provides the Israeli economy a competitive advantage and strengthens Israel&rsquo;s position on the international financial stage. Now is the time for the Government, the capital market and the business companies to join forces and build a strong and advanced market that encourages foreign investments as a foundation for a thriving and robust Israeli economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Tel Aviv, March 4, 2025 -&nbsp;</strong>The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE:&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024 and for 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trading on TASE took place in 2024 against the backdrop of the ongoing war, with high volatility a dominant feature. However, despite the war, the Israeli capital market has exhibited remarkable resilience and, in the last few months of 2024, the yields on the TASE indices reached a turning point and a positive change in market trends. For the year as a whole, the leading TASE equity indices outperformed the leading global indices, with the TA-125 index up 29% and the TA-35 up 28%, versus 25% for the S&amp;P500 and 26% for the NASDAQ100. At the end of 2024, TASE's equity market cap reached NIS 1.4 trillion, a 30% increase from the year-end 2023, largely due to the impact of the rise in TASE&rsquo;s equity indices.</p>
<p>Compared to 2023, trading volumes in TASE markets increased significantly in 2024, with the equities' average daily trading volume reaching NIS 2.2 billion - up 10% over the average daily volume in 2023. During 2024, 8 new companies completed an IPO on TASE, with an aggregate value of NIS 8.4 billion, including 5 new issuers, two dual listings and one company that split off a TASE-listed company. Since the beginning of 2025, 5 new companies have completed an IPO on TASE and other companies are in the pipeline with IPOs scheduled in the coming months.</p>
<p>During 2024, the TASE bonds market increased strength as a major source for raising debt both for listed companies and for the Israeli government.&nbsp; Corporate bond issuances totaled NIS 123.5 billion in 2024, compared to NIS 100 billion in 2023. Additionally, the volume of debt raised through deposit-backed bonds hit a new record, totaling NIS 27 billion, more than double the amount raised in 2023 and over eight times the amount raised in 2022. The strong demand in Israel and abroad for Israeli government bond is a strong sign of confidence in the Israeli economy &ndash; particularly as the war was still being fought throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Core Activities in 2024</strong></p>
<p>In 2024, against the backdrop of exceptional events that had significant impact on the local capital market, TASE continued to implement its strategy of building up core activities and furthering the development and growth of the capital market.</p>
<p>TASE, together with the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) and the Bank of Israel, are preparing for the implementation of the move to change TASE&rsquo;s trading week to Mondays-Fridays, already at the beginning of 2026. This change will bring the trading days into line with international markets, increase the Israeli capital market&rsquo;s liquidity and accessibility for foreign investors and strengthen Israel&rsquo;s position on the international financial stage. As part of the preparations for the change in trading days, TASE recently announced that it intends, in conjunction with ISA, to use AI to translate immediate reports into English, in cooperation with Israeli fintech company, TipRanks. Initially, the reports of the companies included in the TA-125 Index will be published on TASE&rsquo;s MAYA English website, allowing foreign investors to receive reports in English in real time.</p>
<p>At the same time, TASE continues its efforts to grow the number of trading firms and members in the Israeli capital market and two new TASE members commenced operations in 2024 &ndash; Jump Trading Europe B.V., one of Europe&rsquo;s leading international trading entities that joined as a remote member, and Altshuler Shaham Trade, one of Israel&rsquo;s leading investment houses that has begun acting as a TASE member and as a TASE Clearing House member. In addition, Clearstream Banking S.A., one of the two international clearing houses operating in Europe, began to operate on TASE in September 2024, as a custodial member.</p>
<p>Alongside the growth in the number of new TASE members, the volume of trading by new retail investors trading on TASE increased by a notable 12%. This positive development is also part of the continued cooperation between the financial regulators, that are working together to promote competition and enhancing the local capital market by aligning it with international standards.</p>
<p>Responding to strong demand, in the last quarter of the year, TASE increased the colocation capacity in the main hosting site with an additional 11 cabinets. TASE also continued to develop the communication hubs outside of Israel.&nbsp; In addition to the first PoP in London, TASE began to provide connectivity services through the second new PoP established in Frankfurt several months ago and has already recruited its first customers for the service.</p>
<p>In the trading sphere, TASE continued to invest resources in developing the indices market. Overall, during 2024, 21 new equity and bond indices were launched, of which 11 are bespoke indices, and TASE entered into exclusivity contracts with three leading index issuers, for exclusive agreements. &nbsp;Consequently, TASE intends to increase and diversify the products in the coming year as part of its strategic plan to improve and develop more investment products for investors. At the end of December 2024, the total amount of AUM of TASE indices exceeded NIS 100 billion, representing an 18% increase over 2023.</p>
<p>At the beginning of November, TASE launched a block trade facility for large, pre-arranged and protected transactions that ensure real time transparency to the market, in alignment with global standards. In addition, TASE completed at the end of October 2024 the main phase in the reform of the OTC trading system, adapting it for use by foreign investors and aligning it with international standards.</p>
<p>Moreover, further to the Israel Securities Authority&rsquo;s approval last August for non-bank TASE members to trade in crypto currencies for their customers, in January 2025 TASE published a draft for public comments on the basis of which TASE will, for the first time, allow the registration of ETFs on digital assets, such as Bitcoin. This move is part of TASE strategic plan to operate in and develop the field of digital assets.</p>
<p>In the derivatives market, in September 2024 TASE launched futures contracts on three leading indices: TA-35, TA-90 and TA-Banks 5, and also appointed a market maker to ensure liquidity and trade volume in this market and to enable the public to invest at more competitive prices. In addition, following the move that began in June 2024 to reduce the multipliers in the derivatives market on the options in the TA-35, TA-Banks 5, TA-125 and foreign exchange indices, the average daily trading volumes on these options have grown by 25% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>In January 2024, as part of the continuing restructuring of TASE, a deal took place for the sale of the banks&rsquo; Legacy Arrangement shares. Within the framework of this deal, 18.5% of the company&rsquo;s shares were sold, of which the consideration to TASE totaled NIS 242 million. In December 2024, an additional consideration of NIS 10 million was received from a TASE member, that is another shareholder of Legacy Arrangement shares. TASE has now received a total of NIS 317 million from the sale of Legacy Arrangement shares, with only an immaterial balance of such shares remaining. The proceeds received by TASE for the Legacy Arrangement shares have been credited directly to TASE&rsquo;s shareholders equity and are earmarked for developing investments in TASE&rsquo;s technologies infrastructure.</p>
<p>Further to the buyback plans implemented by TASE since 2022, which resulted in the purchase of 10.2 million shares for a consideration of NIS 186 million, on January 9, 2025, a buyback transaction took place with Manikay Fund, an interested party in the company that held 19.2% of TASE&rsquo;s equity at the time. The buyback transaction comprised the purchase of 4.6 million ordinary shares, constituting 4.82% of TASE&rsquo;s issued share capital, at a price of NIS 43.79 per share, for a total consideration of NIS 202.4 million.</p>
<p>In addition, TASE adopted a dividend distribution policy for the years 2024-2026, as part of which TASE will distribute to its shareholders a cash dividend at a rate of 50% of the annual net profit for 2024. In accordance with this policy, TASE&rsquo;s Board of Directors has approved the distribution of a dividend to the shareholders of TASE (for which the record date is March 12, 2025) in a total amount of NIS 51 million, representing NIS 0.53 per ordinary share, that will be paid on March 20, 2025.</p>
<p>In total, over the 14-month period from January 2024 to March 2025, TASE will have made NIS 526 million in distributions to its shareholders, comprising NIS 324 million through dividends, and NIS 202 million through share buyback.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Highlights of the results for the fourth quarter of 2024:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 115.4 million, compared to revenue of NIS 101.4 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 14%. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees, this in addition to the increase in revenue from Clearing House services, mainly as a result of the increase in Clearing House services to members following the completion of regulation measures in relation to OTC transactions.</p>
<p>Revenue from trading and clearing commissions totaled NIS 43 million, an increase of 5% compared to the corresponding quarter last year. The increase in the trading volumes, mainly in shares and derivatives, and in the volume of creations/redemptions of mutual fund units increased revenue from trading and clearing commissions by 19%. In opposition, a reduction of six trading days between the quarters and a reduction in the effective commission rate, primarily in shares and mutual funds, deducted 9% and 5% from the increase in revenue, respectively.</p>
<p>Revenue from listing fees and levies increased by 11% and totaled NIS 22.3 million. Revenue from Clearing House services increased by 25%, totaling NIS 26 million in the fourth quarter. Revenue from data distribution and connectivity services totaled NIS 23 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, a 24% increase compared to the corresponding period last year.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the fourth quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 84.2 million, compared to costs of NIS 76.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 9%. The increase in the costs is due mainly to the increase in employee benefit expenses and marketing expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the fourth quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 2.6 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 3.2 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The decrease in net financing income was due mainly to the increase in the financing expenses with respect to a loan obtained at the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the fourth quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 25.4 million, compared to NIS 20.7 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 22% increase. Most of the increase in profit was due to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 46.8 million, compared to NIS 40.1 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 17% increase. Most of the increase is due to the NIS 6.7 million increase in profit before financing.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the fourth quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 26.5 million, compared to NIS 22.7 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 16%. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the results for full fiscal year 2024</strong></p>
<p><strong>Revenue in 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 438 million, compared to NIS 390 million in 2023, an increase of 12%, which is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees.</p>
<p>Revenue from trading and clearing commissions increased to NIS 166.6 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The increase in the trading volumes in 2024, particularly in shares, and in the volume of creations/redemptions of mutual fund units compared to 2023 increased revenue from trading and clearing by 14%. In opposition, a reduction of four trading days between the years and a reduction in the effective commission rate, primarily in shares, derivatives and mutual funds, deducted 2% and 5% from the increase in revenue, respectively.</p>
<p>Otehrwise in revenue from operations: listing fees and levies totaled NIS 88 million, an increase of 9% compared to 2023. Revenue from Clearing House services grew by 14% to NIS 89 million, but the most significant increase was achieved in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services - an increase of 28% year-over-year to a total of NIS 90.8 million.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 313.4 million, compared to revenues of NIS 291.5 million in 2023, an 8% increase. The increase in the costs is due mainly to the increase in employee benefit expenses, and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in 2024&nbsp;</strong>amounted to NIS 10 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 11.3 million in 2023. Net financing income in 2024 decreased, mainly due to the increase in the financing expenses with respect to a loan obtained at the end of 2023, this despite the increase in financing income as a result of interest income on the deposits and gains on marketable securities.</p>
<p><strong>Net tax expenses in 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 33.1 million, compared to NIS 26.4 million in 2023, an increase of 25%. The increase in the tax expenses was due mainly to the increase in the pre-tax profit.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 101.4 million, compared to NIS 83.2 million in 2023, an increase of 22%. Most of the increase in profit was due to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 186.3 million, compared to NIS 157.6 million in 2023, an 18% increase. The increase is due mainly to an increase of NIS 26.1 million in profit before financing, net of the change in share-based payment expenses and depreciation expenses of NIS 2.6 million.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 107.2 million, compared to NIS 89.3 million in 2023, an increase of 20%. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, and to the adustment of the decrease in costs with respect to share-based payments.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada, appointed as Chair of the FSB Standing Committee for the Assessment of Vulnerabilities (SCAV).</span></li>
<li><span>Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the Single Resolution Board, appointed as Chair of the Resolution Steering Group (ReSG).</span></li>
<li><span>Both appointments are effective as of 4 March 2025.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has appointed the chairs of two of its Standing Committees, following the departures of the previous chairs:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada</span>, has been appointed as Chair of the Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities (SCAV). The SCAV monitors and assesses vulnerabilities in the global financial system and proposes to the FSB Plenary actions needed to address them.</li>
<li><a><span>Dominique Laboureix</span></a><span>, Chair of the Single Resolution Board</span>, has been appointed as Chair of the Resolution Steering Group (ReSG). The ReSG is the primary global forum for the development of global standards and guidance for resolution regimes and for recovery and resolution planning for systemically important financial institutions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Both appointments are effective from 4 March 2025 and are for a two-year term, renewable once.</p>
<p>On the committee appointments, FSB Chair, Klaas Knot said &ldquo;At a time when the financial landscape is rapidly evolving, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities is paramount to maintaining global financial stability. The 2023 banking turmoil underscored the importance of our work on both the assessment of vulnerabilities and resolution. Tiff and Dominique&rsquo;s extensive experience makes them invaluable for these roles and I look forward to working with them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klaas Knot also thanked the outgoing Chairs, Nellie Liang (former Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, US Department of the Treasury, and outgoing Chair of SCAV) and Martin J. Gruenberg (former Chairman of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and outgoing Chair of ReSG), for their leadership and contributions to the FSB&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>Tiff Macklem was appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada on 3 June 2020. He served as Chair of the FSB Standing Committee on Standards Implementation from 2009 to 2013, in his position as Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. He replaces Nellie Liang who stepped down from the US Treasury Department in January 2025.</p>
<p>Dominique Laboureix was appointed Chair of the Single Resolution Board in January 2023. He replaces Martin J.&nbsp;Gruenberg who retired from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in January 2025.</p>
<p>The FSB Standing Committees have been established by the FSB Plenary to each take forward part of the FSB&rsquo;s mandate. Their mandates are set out in the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/uploads/FSB-Charter-with-revised-Annex-FINAL.pdf">FSB Charter</a>, and their current memberships are available&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/about/organisation-and-governance/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Resolution Steering Group (ReSG) was established in 2010 in response to a&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/uploads/g20_leaders_declaration_pittsburgh_2009.pdf">call from G20 Leaders at the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit</a>&nbsp;for the development of &ldquo;tools and frameworks for the effective resolution of financial groups to help mitigate the disruption of financial institution failures and reduce moral hazard in the future&rdquo;. ReSG&rsquo; s initial mandate was to draft the&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions-revised-version-2024/">Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a>&nbsp;(&lsquo;Key Attributes&rsquo;) to help build a common policy framework that countries could use to develop resolution regimes enabling authorities to manage the failure of systemically important financial institutions.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>The FCA has banned Andrew Pearse and Surjan Singh from the UK financial services industry.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The former Credit Suisse managing directors have been banned for lacking integrity, following US convictions for arranging corrupt loans to the Republic of Mozambique.</p>
<p>In July 2019, Mr Pearse pleaded guilty in the US for his role in the conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud, which included him accepting over US$45m in unlawful kickbacks in connection with the loans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2019, Mr Singh also pleaded guilty in the US for his role in the conspiracy to commit money laundering, which included him accepting US$5.7m in unlawful kickbacks in connection with the loans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2021, the FCA fined Credit Suisse over &pound;145m as part of a US $475m global settlement for serious financial crime due diligence failings related to the loans which the bank arranged for the Republic of Mozambique, worth US$1.3bn. The loans were tainted by corruption. The FCA also secured Credit Suisse&rsquo;s agreement to write off US $200m of debt owed by the Republic of Mozambique. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'Mr Pearse and Mr Singh were experienced executives at Credit Suisse who admit to having received over US$50m in kickbacks. There is no place in our markets for those who engage in bribery and corruption.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Currenxie Secures Electronic Money Institution Authorisation From The Central Bank Of Ireland</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/currenxie-secures-electronic-money-institution-authorisation-from-the-central-ba-202534/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/currenxie-secures-electronic-money-institution-authorisation-from-the-central-ba-202534/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cross-border payments company, Currenxie, today announced it has been granted authorisation as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) by the Central Bank of Ireland. This marks a significant step in Currenxie's growth strategy as it enters the European market, with Dublin set to serve as the group's regional headquarters.</p>
<p>Currenxie, a fintech company founded in 2014, specialises in simplifying global payments for businesses. The company provides comprehensive solutions for merchants when collecting, exchanging, and sending money worldwide.</p>
<p>Currenxie becomes the latest financial institution to receive an EMI from the Central Bank of Ireland. Currently, there are approximately only 30 institutions who have received EMI authorisation, demonstrating Currenxie has met the rigorous regulatory standards the Central Bank of Ireland requires for the authorisation process.</p>
<p>The new EMI license enables Currenxie to operate across the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p><b>Sam Coyne, CEO Europe of Currenxie, explains:</b>&nbsp;"<i>This EMI authorisation is the latest milestone in Currenxie&rsquo;s global expansion enabling us to partner with millions of merchants across Europe.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Ireland is fast becoming one of Europe&rsquo;s leading tech and finance hubs with an exceptional depth of talent and a highly credible regulatory environment from which Currenxie can operate, further develop its customer offering and propel its future expansion into new markets. This follows authorisation in the UK as Currenxie&rsquo;s solution continues to scale at pace.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The cross-border payments company, which serves tens of thousands of businesses from its&nbsp;Hong Kong headquarters, already employs 12 people at its Dublin office with plans to scale&nbsp;its operation substantially over the next two years as it launches and expands its&nbsp;service offering throughout Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currenxie has also received EMI authorisation from the FCA to operate in the UK, adding to its existing portfolio of licenses and registrations across multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa, and the United States.</p>

<p>Steffen Koehler, Chief Commercial Officer of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>The EEX Japanese power derivatives market continues its rapid growth in its fifth year, and we are excited to further expand trading opportunities by enabling order book trading. This new electronic trading facility brings further transparency and provides real-time pricing reference, allowing for more informed decisions and improved efficiency when executing trading strategies. By introducing order book trading for those two hours when both domestic and international traders are most active on this market, we will pool liquidity and thus facilitate further growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (Tuesday) that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with CMU OmniClear Limited (CMU OmniClear), a company established to carry out the operations of the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), to jointly explore initiatives that will enhance Hong Kong&rsquo;s post-trade securities infrastructure and support the long-term development of the city&rsquo;s fixed-income and currencies (FIC) ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">Through the collaboration, CMU OmniClear and HKEX will explore and pursue cooperation in areas such as realising cross-asset class efficiencies across equities and fixed income, expanding the mobilisation of Mainland bonds as collateral, enhancing Hong Kong as a bond issuance centre and developing an international central securities depository (ICSD) in Asia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Bonnie Y Chan, HKEX Chief Executive Officer, said, &ldquo;We are delighted to be entering into this cooperation agreement with CMU OmniClear. This agreement underscores HKEX&rsquo;s strategic commitment to build a vibrant, world-leading FIC ecosystem in Hong Kong. We look forward to working closely with the HKMA and CMU OmniClear to advance the development of Hong Kong&rsquo;s fixed-income market, enabling the next chapter of RMB internationalisation and enhancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as an international financial centre, a global risk management centre, and an offshore Renminbi (RMB) business hub.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA and Chairperson of the Board of Directors of CMU OmniClear, said, &ldquo;We are delighted to deepen the cooperation with HKEX on financial market infrastructures in Hong Kong. This MOU signifies an important milestone and our shared commitment to supporting the development of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets. This is also a pivotal step in accelerating the transformation of CMU into an ICSD in Asia upon the establishment of CMU OmniClear. With our collective efforts, we believe we can offer the market a spectrum of products across asset classes, fostering the continued development and innovation in Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>With strengthened collaboration between financial market infrastructures, the partnership seeks to provide the foundation for the roll out of enhancements to bond settlement and collateral management operations and the further expansion of risk management products crucial for the sustainable growth of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">CMU, Hong Kong&rsquo;s fixed-income central securities depository (CSD) operated by CMU OmniClear, has $4.8 trillion of assets under custody and plays a key role in managing the settlement of bond transactions conducted on Bond Connect, as well as supporting the growth of Swap Connect by facilitating efficient use of collateral held with CMU.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX and the HKMA have been collaborating on the development of these two Connect programmes since the launch of Bond Connect in 2017. Both programmes have hit new trading records every year since launch, thanks to growing international participation in Mainland China&rsquo;s fixed-income market -- the world&rsquo;s second largest that has grown fivefold over the past decade to reach RMB177 trillion at the end of 2024.</p>

<title>Japan Financial Services Agency: Publication Of AI Discussion Paper</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="indent">The Financial Services Agency (FSA) issued an AI Discussion Paper entitled &ldquo;Initial points to consider for promoting the sound utilization of AI in the financial sector.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>１．Summary</h2>
<p class="indent">Generative AI&rsquo;s dramatic performance improvements are driving a societal transformation. Looking ahead, AI is expected to greatly improve efficiency and convenience across industries, including finance, and in various aspects of daily life, contributing to improved living standards and national economic development. However, the utilization of complex AI, particularly generative AI, presents challenges and emerging risks, such as misuse leading to crime and the spread of misinformation. While the financial sector is actively exploring AI adoption, concerns about risks and regulatory hurdles are causing some hesitation. Recognizing the "risk of inaction"-the potential for long-term decline in high-quality financial services due to technological stagnation-we encourage initiatives that emphasize customer convenience and operational efficiency. Therefore, the FSA has published this Discussion Paper to provide strong support for the sound use of AI and to contribute to constructive dialogue with business operators in the future.</p>
<h2>２．Request for Comments</h2>
<p class="indent">This Discussion Paper provides an initial overview of the current state and challenges of AI utilization in financial institutions, examining a broad range of related issues. As this analysis is preliminary, technological advancements and evolving business landscapes may significantly alter the identified challenges. We intend to use these viewpoints as a foundation for ongoing dialogue with stakeholders and to evolve and refine specific future policies. We welcome your comments and suggestions via email to the Fintech and Innovation Office, Risk Analysis and Analysis Division, Policy Bureau [ai. survey ★ fsa. go. jp Please replace the 】(「★」 code with "@".] Please note that we are not accepting comments via telephone.</p>

<title>SEC Staff Facilitates Capital Formation For Companies Planning Public Offering</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-staff-facilitates-capital-formation-for-companies-planning-public-offering-202534/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its Division of Corporation Finance is further facilitating capital formation by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/whats-new/draft-registration-statement-processing-procedures-expanded">enhancing the accommodations available</a>&nbsp;to companies for nonpublic review of draft registration statements.</p>
<p>In 2012, the JOBS Act&nbsp;permitted certain companies to confidentially submit for staff review a draft registration statement for an initial public offering. In 2017, the staff expanded these accommodations to all companies conducting certain securities offerings, including initial public offerings and follow-on offerings within one year of their initial public offering. With today&rsquo;s announcement, the accommodations for companies submitting draft registration statements for nonpublic review will be further enhanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the years, staff have observed companies seeking to raise capital are taking advantage of the nonpublic review process when available. Expanding these popular accommodations will provide new and existing companies greater flexibility to explore and plan public offerings,&rdquo; said Cicely LaMothe, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Corporation Finance. &ldquo;These enhanced accommodations will further support capital formation while retaining investor protections available to purchasers in public offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enhanced accommodations will expand the types of forms eligible to be submitted as draft registration statements for nonpublic review and permit reporting companies to submit draft registration statements for nonpublic review regardless of how much time has passed since their initial public offering. In addition, companies will have added flexibility to start the review process earlier by omitting certain underwriter disclosures from their initial submissions.</p>
<p>Companies may submit questions about their eligibility to use the enhanced accommodations to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CFDraftPolicy@sec.gov">CFDraftPolicy@sec.gov</a>.</p>

<title>US Treasury Department Announces Suspension Of Enforcement Of Corporate Transparency Act Against U.S. Citizens And Domestic Reporting Companies</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-department-announces-suspension-of-enforcement-of-corporate-transpar-202533/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Treasury Department is announcing today that, with respect to the Corporate Transparency Act, not only will it not enforce any penalties or fines associated with the beneficial ownership information reporting rule under the existing regulatory deadlines, but it will further not enforce any penalties or fines against U.S. citizens or domestic reporting companies or their beneficial owners after the forthcoming rule changes take effect either. The Treasury Department will further be issuing a proposed rulemaking that will narrow the scope of the rule to foreign reporting companies only. Treasury takes this step in the interest of supporting hard-working American taxpayers and small businesses and ensuring that the rule is appropriately tailored to advance the public interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a victory for common sense,&rdquo; said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action is part of President Trump&rsquo;s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SIFMA Releases Compendium On U.S. Equity Market Structure</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-releases-compendium-on-us-equity-market-structure-202533/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-releases-compendium-on-us-equity-market-structure-202533/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA published its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/insights/insights-equity-market-structure-compendium/">U.S. Equity Market Structure Compendium</a>, which analyzes themes and metrics across equity markets, volatility (VIX), equity trading, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options trading, and capital formation for 2024.</p>
<p>The Compendium also offers insights into what could happen in 2025, via survey results from our equity markets and options trading committees, as well as representatives from equity and options exchanges. The survey examined respondents&rsquo; expectations for market metrics on volatility and trading volumes for equities and options, as well as retail investor participation and stock market performance, including potential upside and downside risks.</p>
<p>According to the report, &ldquo;Market participants are 8-10% optimistic about the equities market this year &ndash; not another 20% optimistic &ndash; which would put us at the historical return level (on average since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 returned 8.0%).&nbsp; Of note, the consensus estimate from equity strategists for the S&amp;P 500 price target to end this year is 6,600 to 6,700 (at the writing of this report). Looking at the numbers, this would represent an almost 14% increase from the end of year price.&nbsp; However, if you look at the price of the S&amp;P 500 prior to the December FOMC meeting &ndash; the one where the Fed spooked markets by lowering expectations for rate cuts in 2025 &ndash; it represents a 10-11% return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also discusses drivers for equity market performance this year, looking both at what drove markets last year and whether that theme can continue in 2025. These include the AI boom, market concentration, higher-for-longer rates, and earnings growth.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equity Markets:</span>&nbsp;The S&amp;P 500 returned an impressive 23.3%, marking the first time we saw consecutive years with 20% plus returns since the 1990s. Performance was not the same across all categories, as the full index outperformed all other segments except for growth. It was a strong year for large cap stocks and growth stocks.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VIX:</span>&nbsp;The VIX pushed through events to come down for the year, continuing its realignment to historical levels, averaging 15.61 in 2024, -7.5% Y/Y. This was despite having a higher peak than seen since 2020.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Equity Trading:</span>&nbsp;Equity average daily trading volume (ADV) surpassed the 12 billion shares level, ending the year at 12.2 billion shares, +10.2% Y/Y. A key theme last year was the growth in trading of low price stocks &ndash;28% of shares traded were priced $5 or below, and 13.5% were priced under $1.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ETFs:</span>&nbsp;At 2.4 billion shares, ETF volumes remained elevated to historical levels, +5.8% Y/Y, and represented 19.6% of total equity market volumes. The global ETF industry gathered $1.7 trillion in net inflows in 2024, the highest level of annual net inflows since 2021.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Options Trading:</span>&nbsp;Options volumes ended the year at 47.3 million contracts, +9.0% Y/Y, and peaked at 70.6 million contracts. A key theme last year was the growth in short-dated options. From 2018 to 2024, the use of short-dated options grew 318.3%, from 6.0 million contracts to 25.1 million contracts, and reached 54.9% of total options volumes, up from 32.6%.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capital Formation:</span>&nbsp;Capital markets performed well overall as total equity issuance (excluding SPACs) finished at $221.4 billion, +59.3% Y/Y, and IPO deal value totaled $31.3 billion, +55.8% Y/Y. The number of listed operating companies declined last year to 5,455, -4.4% Y/Y, marking the third year of annual declines in a row.</li>

<title>FTSE Russell Announces Changes To FTSE UK Index Series Methodology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Changes to the Sterling Denominated Price Requirement and Fast Entry Thresholds will be effective from the September 2025 index review</li>
<li>Securities which trade in Euros and US Dollars to be considered for potential inclusion to the FTSE UK Index Series, in addition to securities trading in Sterling</li>
<li>Lowering of the Fast Entry Thresholds will ensure the indices reflect the underlying market accurately and in a timely manner, consequent to significant Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)</li>
</ul>
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today announces two changes to the FTSE UK Index Series methodology.</p>
<p>Following a review of the FTSE UK Index Series, FTSE Russell will make changes to the Sterling Denominated Price Requirement and Fast Entry Thresholds, effective from the September 2025 index review.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sterling Denominated Price Requirement</b></p>
<p>From September 2025, securities which trade in non-GBP currencies (i.e. Euros or US Dollars) will be considered for potential inclusion to the FTSE UK Index Series, if otherwise eligible. Currently, the FTSE UK Index Eligibility Criteria specifies that only securities trading in Sterling are eligible for inclusion to the FTSE UK Index Series. Inclusion will still require a UK nationality and a listing on the Equity Shares (Commercial Companies) or Closed-ended investment fund categories, as set out in the FTSE UK Index Series ground rules.</p>
<p>As things stand, there are no companies immediately eligible for inclusion on the effective date of this change to the inclusion criteria. However, the actual and longer-term impact to the composition of the indices will be guided by changes to the underlying market and specifically index eligible securities opting to trade in Euros or US Dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fast Entry Thresholds</b></p>
<p>FTSE Russell will also lower the Fast Entry Thresholds employed within the FTSE UK Index Series.</p>
<p>If a company listing on the London Stock Exchange ranks 225th or above based on the close price on the first day of unconditional dealings, and has an investable market capitalisation of GBP 1 billion&nbsp; (based on the IPO offering shares minus any restricted holdings, if applicable), then the company, if otherwise eligible, will be placed in the FTSE 100 or FTSE 250, as appropriate, after the close on its fifth day of trading. Concurrently, the lowest rank constituent will be deleted from the applicable index and associated membership changes implemented.</p>
<p>The Fast Entry Thresholds will be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure they remain fit for purpose.</p>
<p><b>David Sol, Global Head of Policy at FTSE Russell, comments:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;We regularly look at the methodology of our indices to ensure they continue to represent the underlying market and sectors. This includes our recent review of the FTSE UK Index Series, where the companies included are inextricably intertwined with the companies that list on the London Stock Exchange. Whilst there will be no immediate impact on the index composition, these two changes will give the FTSE UK Index Series a timely and more accurate representation of companies that can list in London today and in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index holds steady at 147</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Small business sales grew +2.1% year over year and +0.1% month over month</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for February 2025, with the seasonally adjusted Index holding steady at 147, unchanged from January. While total spending growth was nearly flat compared to January, sector-level trends showed consumers shifting more spend to retailers and restaurants in February and spending less at service-based businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending continued to show resiliency in February, resulting in a second consecutive month of small business sales growth to start 2025,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv. &ldquo;Notably, Restaurants, Furniture, Auto Parts, Clothing and Health Care all saw growth during the month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a year-over-year basis, small business sales (+2.1%) and total transactions (+4.0%) showed healthy growth. Month-over-month sales (+0.1%) and transactions (+1.6%) also grew.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, combined sales growth for January and February is 3.5%, which is about 1.5 percentage points less than sales growth from the same two-month period in 2024. The slowing growth is the result of lower average ticket size, while transaction growth remains steady.</p>
<p><span>Retail Demand Remains Strong in February</span></p>
<p>Consumer spending at small business retail remained strong with sales (+1.6%) and transactions (+1.2%) growing year over year. Average ticket sizes (+0.4%) also grew, marking the first month since January 2023 that retail tickets have shown a year-over-year increase. Retail sales growth year over year was led by General Merchandise (+7.3%), Clothing (+3.7%) and Sporting Goods/Miscellaneous Retailers (+3.6%).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, small business retail sales (+0.9%) grew and transaction growth was unchanged; average ticket sizes also increased (+0.8%). The most noticeable acceleration in sales growth came from Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers (+3.1%) and Furniture, Home Furnishings and Electronics (+5.0%). Consumers slowed their pace of spending in Grocery, Health and Personal Care, and Gas.</p>
<p><span>Restaurants Grow Compared to January, but Headwinds Persist</span></p>
<p>Consumer spending at small business restaurants declined (-2.4%) year over year despite transactions (or foot traffic) growing (+5.9%). These annualized sales declines despite foot traffic growing reflect the ongoing trend of consumers trading down for lower-cost options when dining out.</p>
<p>On a month-over-month basis, restaurants experienced a welcomed bounce, growing both total sales (+2.3%) and transactions (+3.9%). Similar to the annual trend, average ticket sizes declined (-1.6%) month over month.</p>
<p><span>Services Growth Slows</span></p>
<p>As consumers shifted more of their dollars to restaurants and retailers in February, service-oriented spending showed signs of slowing, growing just +2.3% year over year and declining (-0.2%) month over month.</p>
<p>On an annual basis, the fastest-growing service categories were Professional Services (+8.7%), Religious, Civic and Professional Organizations (+7.0%), and Truck Transportation (+7.0%). Sectors seeing the largest sales decline were Equipment Manufacturing (-9.3%), Rental and Leasing Services (-5.9%), and Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation (-5.2%).</p>
<p>Compared to January 2025, Hospitals (+1.8%), Personal and Laundry Services (+1.6%), Ambulatory Health Care Services (+1.5%) and Educational Services (+0.7%), saw the most growth. Sales declined most in Information Services (-2.6%) and Administrative Services (-2.3%).</p>
<p><span>Regional Trends</span></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>States showing the most year-over-year sales growth were North Dakota (+11.8%), Georgia (+10.6%), South Carolina (+8.6%), Minnesota (+7.0%) and Virginia (+6.2%). The strongest-performing states month over month were North Dakota (+8.8%), Louisiana (+5.7%), Texas (+4.3%), Indiana (+4.0%) and Alabama (+3.6%).</li>
<li>Large cities showing the most year-over-year sales growth were Atlanta (+14.4%) and Miami (+5.3%); conversely, the New York metro area saw sales decline (-5.7%) year over year. On a monthly basis, sales growth was strongest in Dallas (+4.6%), Atlanta (+3.2%) and Philadelphia (+1.2%).</li>
</ul>
<p><span>About the Fiserv Small Business Index<span>&reg;</span></span></p>
<p>The Fiserv Small Business Index is published during the first week of every month and differentiated by its direct aggregation of consumer spending activity within the U.S. small business ecosystem. Rather than relying on survey or sentiment data, the Fiserv Small Business Index is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online across approximately 2 million U.S. small businesses, including hundreds of thousands leveraging the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform.</p>
<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic. Through a simple interface, users can access data by region, state, and/or across business types categorized by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Computing a monthly index for 16 sectors and 34 sub-sectors, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a timely, reliable and consistent measure of small business performance even in industries where large businesses dominate.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bw-dateline-wrapper">ATLANTA &amp; NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--&nbsp;</span>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its March 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s robust mortgage, real estate and public records datasets. This month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor analyzes the latest trends shaping the housing market in early 2025, with a special emphasis on rising insurance costs and the ways borrowers are adapting to protect what, for many, may be their most valuable asset.</p>
<p>Property insurance costs for mortgaged single-family homes rose by a record $276 (+14%) to $2,290 in 2024 with average premiums now up 61% over the past 5 years. Seattle (+22%), Salt Lake City (+22%) and Los Angeles (+20%) saw the largest percentage increases in 2024, while the largest increases by dollar amount were in Dallas (+$606) and Houston ($515). Premiums in Florida increased by less than half the national average on a percentage basis, but rates there remain among the highest in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s no surprise that insurance costs are rising, we&rsquo;re beginning to see emerging trends in terms of how homeowners are responding to the higher cost environment,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research for Intercontinental Exchange. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing increases in both the share of borrowers switching policies and borrowers taking on higher deductibles as a way to combat rising premiums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE loan-level data shows that a record 11.4% of borrowers switched insurance providers in 2024, up from 9.4% in 2023 and less than 8% historically,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;While this has undoubtedly been driven by rising non-renewal rates, it may also be a sign of borrowers switching providers in search of lower premiums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Markets with the highest insurance costs, which have also been the focal point of non-renewal activity in recent years, unsurprisingly have the highest percentage of borrowers switching providers. Nearly a quarter of mortgage holders in Miami, for example, switched insurance providers in 2024, the highest share of any major market, followed by New Orleans and Orlando (both 23%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The average borrower switching policies in Miami paid slightly more, but in most markets with higher-than-average turnover, borrowers who switched are paying less than those that stayed put,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;For example, in Jacksonville, Dallas, San Antonio and Denver, homeowners who switched paid at least 10% less, on average than borrowers who remained with their old carrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;California, where insurers have been reducing their footprint due to strict regulations and rising wildfire risk, stands out as a notable exception,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;Borrowers who switched providers in San Diego, Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Jose all paid at least 15% more, on average, than those who stayed put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Separate research from the ICE Climate team suggests borrowers taking out mortgages in recent years may also be taking on higher deductibles to help offset rising premiums. Homeowners who took out mortgages in 2024, for example, had a 19% ($390) higher deductible than the average single-family mortgage holder. That same group had 12% ($284) lower annual insurance premiums than the market at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As borrowers become more interested in shopping for the best insurance rates, there is an emerging opportunity for lenders and servicers to meet this need with embedded insurance comparison tools both at the front end of the pipeline and for people with existing mortgages,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s integrations with insurance providers in both our origination and servicing platforms have been aimed at exactly this opportunity as part of our continuing goal of making home finance as simple and transparent as possible.&rdquo;</p>

LTD. (the &ldquo;Purchaser&rdquo;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiserv, will file an early warning report in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Coinhako, (a leading Singapore-based firm a leading digital asset platform in Singapore) today announces it will be joining Fusion Digital Assets, TP ICAP's FCA registered UK-based wholesale spot cryptoasset exchange.</p>
<p>Coinhako will be joining as trading counterpart, providing and consuming liquidity on the exchange. The collaboration will see the integration of Coinhako&rsquo;s advanced trading and liquidity solutions with Fusion Digital Assets, helping facilitate risk exchange and increase liquidity in response to the growing demand of the wholesale market.</p>
<p>Kelvin See, Head of Trading, Coinhako: &ldquo;This announcement aligns Coinhako with a significant increase in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, spurred by the formation of digital assets as a standalone investment class. As institutional investors increasingly seek portfolio diversification through cryptoassets, the requirement for platforms capable of handling increased order sizes in the wholesale market becomes paramount. For sophisticated investors and trading firms, liquidity, transparency and price slippage are crucial considerations, and this partnership will cater to those needs and will help drive further adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon Forster, Managing Director, TP ICAP Digital Assets: &ldquo;2024 was a watershed moment for the cryptoasset class: the year that the wholesale market truly began to take permanent shape. Fusion Digital Assets is built to offer institutional clients a reliable platform to access high-quality liquidity, positioning us to capitalize on the growth of the wholesale crypto market. Adding a partner of Coinhako&rsquo;s calibre is another important step forward in the growth of our exchange and paves the way for an even stronger and more promising 2025&rdquo;</p>

<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">Speech given by Afua Kyei, the Bank&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officer, to the next generation of Chartered Accountants, drawing on the relevance of the 1920s known for the economic boom after the First World War in the context of UK&rsquo;s growth ambitions.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good evening everyone, students and all our distinguished guests.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chartered Accountants Students Society London (&ldquo;CASSL&rdquo;) for organising this event. And thanks to the ICAEW for hosting. The last time we met was when I gave a speech at Mansion House a couple of years ago to CASSL, London Society of Chartered Accountants and Presidents of the International Accounting Bodies. It&rsquo;s great that CASSL has brought us back together - just as some of the students are about to qualify as accountants.</p>
<p>Today is an important Finance day at the Bank of England. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the first day of the new financial year! This means that across the Bank, we will start executing on the Bank&rsquo;s new 3-year strategic plan and in Finance, we will be closing the ledger for year-end - an experience that many of you will be familiar with!</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be here at the home of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and surrounded by this spectacular Great Gatsby theme. The 1920s theme this evening is apt as&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk191886660"></a>the 1920s were known for the economic boom that happened after the First World war<a id="_Hlk191731519"></a>. You may know that the Bank of England&rsquo;s primary objective is to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. You may or may not know that through our committees, the Bank has secondary objectives to support government economic policy e.g. the Prudential Regulation Authority has two secondary objectives: a secondary competition objective and a secondary competitiveness and growth objective.</p>
<p>And this evening we are in the Square Mile, and the Mayoral theme for our Lord Mayor Alastair King, is - &ldquo;Growth Unleashed&rdquo;.</p>
<h3>International Women&rsquo;s Day</h3>
<p>In a week, we will celebrate International Women&rsquo;s Day. So I would like to highlight the significance of the 1920s for another reason. In 1920, Mary Harris Smith was the first female to be admitted as a chartered accountant to the ICAEW aged 75. As the ICAEW has published: in 1891, Mary first applied to be a member of ICAEW and was turned away; and all her repeated attempts to join were unsuccessful. After the First World War, women took on roles that changed the attitudes of society. Then in 1919, legislation was passed meaning it was illegal for women to be barred from ICAEW membership. So in May 1920, Mary Harris Smith was admitted as a fellow of the ICAEW and became the first female chartered accountant.</p>
<p>Amidst this &ldquo;Roaring twenties&rdquo; backdrop, this evening I wanted to now talk to you about the impact and influence that we can have as Accounting professionals<strong>.</strong></p>
<h3>Accountants add far more than just numbers&hellip;</h3>
<p>As Warren Buffett says "Accounting is the language of business.&rdquo; I would add to that and say &ldquo;Accounting is the language of the economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little bit about me, to introduce myself. I joined the Bank of England as the Chief Financial Officer 6 years ago<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>I didn&rsquo;t take a traditional or straight path en route to becoming a CFO - I did different things along the way and forged my own path as the opportunities presented themselves. I read Chemistry at university. I joined Ernst &amp; Young in London on the graduate program where I trained as a Chartered Accountant in Banking and Capital Markets Audit. Then I joined the mid-cap financial services Mergers &amp; Acquisitions team. I was an investment banker at UBS, travelling all over the world, advising the Group and UBS&rsquo;s clients on their capital, funding and liquidity structures. Then I did divisional CFO roles at Barclays before joining the Bank of England, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>When I was training to be an accountant, I remember seeing a big advert on the underground saying that about 80% of Board members are Chartered accountants. I found this really inspiring, and it revealed just how far this qualification can take you.</p>
<p>I know that undertaking a professional qualification involves lots of exams, lots of sacrifice and lots of hard work. Looking back, I would say it builds resilience that helps you through the tough times later, so it&rsquo;s all worth it. So if you hit a roadblock, think about your future potential and I&rsquo;d encourage you to persevere with your exams, because your Chartered Accountancy qualification will open doors for you.</p>
<p>Like the Bank of England, Chartered Accountants have a long history of serving the public interest. The Bank is 330 years old and its reputation is built on integrity and transparency. These are the same two pillars upon which the accounting profession is built.</p>
<p>As accountants, we have an important role to play in driving economic growth and productivity in the UK at a key time in our economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan the&nbsp;<strong>strategy</strong></li>
<li>We decide how to&nbsp;<strong>allocate business resources and where to invest</strong></li>
<li>We influence&nbsp;<strong>pricing decisions</strong>, set&nbsp;<strong>efficiency targets</strong>&nbsp;and we put&nbsp;<strong>funding mechanisms</strong>&nbsp;in place</li>
<li>We drive and measure&nbsp;<strong>business performance</strong></li>
<li>We provide&nbsp;<strong>stability and clarity</strong>&nbsp;within our organisations</li>
<li>We are responsible for&nbsp;<strong>sustainability and climate change</strong>&nbsp;reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountants all over the world have been having a societal impact, helping organisations, individuals and communities navigate the tough times we have had in recent years spanning Brexit, the Covid pandemic, wars and conflict around the world and the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>Accountants help our organisations across the private sector, public sector and charities sector to pivot dynamically between operating strategically and tactically as we respond to external shocks.</p>
<p>At this current time, our skills are more important as they have ever been, given the various sources of uncertainty in the current economic environment, including the geopolitical tensions, and the risk of trade tariffs. These may have knock on consequences, such as retaliatory trade tariffs, and movements in foreign exchange rates, putting more pressure on the global economy.</p>
<h3>Turning to Innovation</h3>
<p>As students, you can help drive growth and innovation in the UK. There are plenty of opportunities and together we can create even more opportunities.</p>
<p>London is the leading global financial centre in the world and the UK continues to be a global centre for innovation. We are the second largest Fintech hub in the world, and the largest in Europe. Although we face strong competition from around the globe, we have the experience and talent to succeed - including everyone in this room.</p>
<h3>To our students, reflecting on things I have learned along the way:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t have a fixed plan &ndash; lots of people don&rsquo;t, and I certainly didn&rsquo;t!</li>
<li>Be flexible and take risks.</li>
<li>Build relationships as that will open up new opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Careers</h3>
<p>It is up to you to decide&nbsp;<em>wha</em>t you want to do during your career and<em>&nbsp;how</em>&nbsp;you want to do it. What I can say is that your own career aspirations will take you wherever you want to go -in the UK and internationally, and in any field &ndash; whether that be healthcare, defence, diplomacy, media, private equity, construction &ndash; literally any field.</p>
<p>You can influence decisions at the highest level in the public sector, private sector and charities sector. If you want to be a founder, an entrepreneur, a Chairperson, CEO, CFO, a Lord Mayor, a commercial leader, a Banker, Partner or indeed the President of an Accounting Body&hellip; All I can say from my experience is&hellip;that as an accountant, you are already on the right track!</p>
<p>The possibilities for your career are endless and you have an exciting future ahead of you, so stick with it, even when the going gets tough. You can do it!</p>
<h3>To wrap up</h3>
<p>As a Finance community, we have a huge amount of knowledge and influence.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s share this with each other. Let&rsquo;s develop strong unity between us. Let&rsquo;s pull together to drive this country&rsquo;s growth agenda. Let&rsquo;s solve together some of the biggest challenges that the world is facing.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank my Bank of England colleagues for helping to proofread this speech: Mohini Gurung, Matthew Naylor, Tom Knight, Paul McArdle, Martin Seneca and Rhys Phillips.</p>

<p><i>In 2024, we welcomed several new initiatives to make Saxo Bank attractive for even more people. A few highlights are the introduction of more competitive prices across products and the launch of our automated monthly investing account known as AutoInvest. We also introduced our Investor platforms to more markets, enabling more curious people to get invested in the world.</i></p>
<p><i>Moving forward, our strategic focus remains unchanged. We continue to focus on growing our number of clients and client assets, and on enhancing the product and platform offerings to the benefit of our clients while focusing on our core markets.</i></p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Spotlights Account Intrusion Scams - CIRO Gives Investors The Tools To Protect Themselves From A Recent Pattern Of Scams</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-spotlights-account-intrusion-scams-202531/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-spotlights-account-intrusion-scams-202531/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Approximately one in five Canadians have been approached with a possible investment fraud, according to the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/8526/download?inline" target="_self" title="Investor Survey">Investor Survey</a>. During Fraud Prevention Month, CIRO is warning Canadians about an emerging scam known as account intrusions.</p>
<p>Account intrusions occur when criminals gain unauthorized access to online accounts through email, text messages, malicious links and apps. Once inside the investment account, fraudsters can execute trades and then transfer funds to their own (often untraceable and foreign) accounts or attempt to withdraw funds. These scams are sophisticated&mdash;involving urgent requests to update passwords under the pretense that they may already have been compromised or requests to click on links that are malicious. Making matters even worse, the fraudsters may impersonate real organizations&rsquo; email addresses or website links.</p>
<p>CIRO&rsquo;s Fraud Prevention Month campaign aims to prevent account intrusions while arming investors with the tools to protect themselves. The Investor Survey also showed that of those who had been approached with possible investment fraud, most were contacted through unsolicited, spam emails, texts or calls from strangers, or messages on social media. The advice to investors is simple: &ldquo;<strong>Stop and think before you click!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Through their gatekeeper obligations, dealers have assisted CIRO&rsquo;s Trade Review and Analysis Team in identifying an increase, or pattern, in these account intrusions,&rdquo; said Kevin McCoy, Senior Vice-President, Market Regulation, CIRO. &ldquo;With the increased use of online DIY platforms and investors accessing their accounts on-the-fly on mobile devices, we felt it was important to flag this relatively sophisticated scam and provide meaningful tips for Canadian investors to help protect themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CIRO&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/1206/download?inline" target="_self" title="Blueprint for Office of the Investor (English)">Office of the Investor Blueprint</a>&nbsp;identifies fraud, scams and financial exploitation as a major theme and area of focus for the organization. Investment fraud and financial exploitation take a destructive toll on victims. While the financial cost to victims can be significant, the full impact often goes beyond lost money and includes stress, anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>CIRO&rsquo;s Office of the Investor team led the investor education and protection initiative through the production of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/avoiding-fraud-and-protecting-your-investments/fraud-prevention-month" target="_self" title="Fraud Prevention Month">video</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/avoiding-fraud-and-protecting-your-investments/fraud-prevention-month/account-intrusions-cybersecurity-checklist" target="_self" title="Account Intrusions: Cybersecurity Checklist">a cybersecurity checklist</a>&nbsp;and the launch of a new series&mdash;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/avoiding-fraud-and-protecting-your-investments/fraud-prevention-month/investment-account-intrusion" target="_self" title="The Investment Account Intrusion">Schemes, Scams and Swindles</a>&mdash;providing fictionalized accounts based on real investor experiences with fraud and scams. The first story focusses on account intrusions and serves as a cautionary tale, bringing the experience to life for potential victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Investor Survey also revealed that only 14% of those who were approached with a fraudulent scheme reported the incident. This campaign aims to educate investors and equip them with the knowledge and skills to identify account intrusion-type scams before they happen to them,&rdquo; said Karen McGuinness, Senior Vice-President, Finance, Investor and Member Relations.</p>
<h2>Account Intrusions: Cybersecurity Checklist</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/avoiding-fraud-and-protecting-your-investments/fraud-prevention-month/account-intrusions-cybersecurity-checklist" target="_self" title="Account Intrusions: Cybersecurity Checklist">Account Intrusions: Cybersecurity Checklist</a>&nbsp;gives Canadian investors quick tips and tricks for ensuring their online activities are safe and make it more difficult for would-be account intruders to access personal information and get into the investment account. The Checklist includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verify the legitimacy</strong>&nbsp;of emails by checking the sender&rsquo;s email address and texts by contacting the sender through an alternate, official channel.</li>
<li><strong>Verify links before you click them.</strong>&nbsp;Links can contain malware or viruses which will infect your device. If in doubt &ndash; always avoid. Hover over the link to see if the sender/website address matches what you expect.</li>
<li>Always enable&nbsp;<strong>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong>&nbsp;for your investment accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Switch on your spam filter.</strong>&nbsp;This should prevent most spoofed emails from coming into your inbox.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Victim of an Account Intrusion?</h2>
<p>If you believe you have been the victim of an account intrusion, contact your dealer immediately and report fraud to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/index-eng.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener noreferrer noopener" target="_self">Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre</a>.</p>

<p><span>By law and in practice, responsibility for SEC action lies with its presidentially-appointed Commissioners, not its career staff. &nbsp;Commissioner Peirce, my colleague and head of the SEC Crypto Task Force, spoke to this yesterday when she said that staff &ldquo;appropriately worked hard to execute as effectively as possible the Commission&rsquo;s directives&rdquo; on an enforcement matter. &nbsp;No matter our policy differences, this is something on which we wholeheartedly agree - there is no critique to be made of hardworking civil servants for simply doing their jobs.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Marjorie Chorlins, Senior Vice President for Europe at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued the following statement in response to the meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. business&nbsp;community is&nbsp;encouraged&nbsp;by the strong signals coming out of yesterday&rsquo;s White House meeting. President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer&rsquo;s commitment to a new economic framework is exactly the kind of forward-looking leadership that will drive growth, innovation, and job creation&nbsp;on both sides of the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are at a pivotal moment. The UK is the single largest investor in the U.S., and our&nbsp;bilateral&nbsp;economic ties support millions of jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. A next-generation trade deal&mdash;one&nbsp;reducing&nbsp;barriers,&nbsp;fostering&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;in&nbsp;cutting-edge industries, and&nbsp;ensuring&nbsp;our businesses remain globally competitive&mdash;is the logical next step. The U.S. Chamber&rsquo;s U.S.-UK Business Council stands ready to support efforts to turn this vision into reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we strongly applaud the introduction of the Undertaking Negotiations on Investment and Trade for Economic Dynamism (UNITED) Act by Senators Coons and Moran and Representatives Adrian Smith and Jim Himes. This legislation sends a clear, bipartisan signal that Congress is committed to re-engaging with the UK on a modernized trade agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time to seize the opportunity. We urge the administration to move quickly and work with the UK to formalize a framework that delivers tangible benefits for businesses and consumers in both nations.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Preliminary Report On Foreign Holdings Of U.S. Securities At End-June 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/preliminary-report-on-foreign-holdings-of-us-securities-at-end-june-2024-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Preliminary data from the June 2024 benchmark survey of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities were released today on the Treasury website at&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/us-liabilities-to-foreigners-from-holdings-of-us-securities">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/us-liabilities-to-foreigners-from-holdings-of-us-securities</a>.&nbsp; Final survey results, which will include additional detail as well as possible revisions to the preliminary data, will be reported on April 30, 2025.&nbsp; The survey was undertaken jointly by Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.&nbsp; The next annual survey will cover holdings at the end of June 2025; preliminary data are expected to be released by February 27, 2026.</p>
<p>Complementary surveys measuring U.S. holdings of foreign securities are also carried out annually.&nbsp; Data from the most recent survey, reporting on securities held at year-end 2024, are currently being processed.&nbsp; Preliminary results are expected to be reported by August 29, 2025.</p>
<h3>Overall Preliminary Results</h3>
<p>The survey measured the value of foreign holdings of U.S. securities as of June 30, 2024, to be $31,288 billion, with $16,988 billion held in U.S. equities, $12,982 billion held in U.S. long-term debt securities [1] (of which $1,635 billion are holdings of asset-backed securities (ABS)&nbsp;[2] and $11,347 billion are holdings of non-ABS securities), and $1,319 billion held in U.S. short-term debt securities.&nbsp; The previous survey, conducted as of June 30, 2023, measured the value of total foreign holdings of U.S. securities at $26,872 billion, with holdings of $13,719 billion in U.S. equities, $11,967 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities, and $1,186 billion in U.S. short-term debt securities (see Table A).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<title>Coalition Of Financial Trade Associations Urge CISA To Rescind And Revise Overly Broad Cyber Reporting Rule</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/coalition-of-financial-trade-associations-urge-cisa-to-rescind-and-revise-overly-2025228/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/coalition-of-financial-trade-associations-urge-cisa-to-rescind-and-revise-overly-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A coalition of financial trade associations today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/cyber-incident-reporting-rule/">urged</a>&nbsp;the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to rescind and reissue its proposed cyber incident reporting rule to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. The groups &mdash; including the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Institute of International Bankers and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association &mdash; warn that the proposed rule diverges from congressional intent, imposes unnecessary burdens and shifts critical cybersecurity resources away from defending institutions and their customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe the proposed rule will have significant and detrimental repercussions if not substantially revised,&rdquo; the Associations wrote. &ldquo;As such, we ask that you work with industry to craft a new rule that allows a victim company to focus its resources on responding to an attack rather than filing government reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>What They&rsquo;re Saying:</span></p>
<p>CIRCIA, signed into law in March 2022, was championed by bipartisan lawmakers to strengthen cyber incident reporting without creating undue burdens. However, key congressional leaders now express concern that CISA&rsquo;s proposed rule exceeds its mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The NPRM ignores the burden to industry by asserting that technology will process the amount of information it requests . . . [The proposal would] undoubtedly skyrocket[] compliance work and clashes with congressional intent.&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;<span>Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY)</span></li>
<li>&ldquo;The NPRM appears to, at times, mischaracterize or dismiss Congressional intent&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp;<span>Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Yvette Clarke (D-NY), and Eric Swalwell (D-CA)</span></li>
<li>&ldquo;[I]t is very important that the regulation is well-crafted and reflects both Congressional intent and the public&rsquo;s recommendations.&nbsp; As currently&nbsp;written, I have concerns that the effect of this proposed rule fails to hit this mark.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;<span>Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>What are the associations requesting?</span></p>
<p>As the Associations have&nbsp;<a href="https://bpi.com/cisa-misses-mark-on-proposed-cyber-incident-reporting-rule/">previously advocated</a>, the successful implementation of this rule must account for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Limit the scope of reporting to what matters most</span>. The current scope is too broad and risks overwhelming regulators with irrelevant data. Instead, limit reporting to substantial incidents that affect critical services. Moreover, CISA should clarify that the reporting requirements only apply to the U.S. operations of financial institutions and would not apply if an incident occurs entirely outside of the United States.</li>
<li><span>Focus data collection on what companies &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; to prevent contagion.</span>&nbsp;The information collected should be based on actionable information that could be shared with other companies to protect the economy and prevent the exploitation of similar vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><span>Clarify and reduce the supplemental reporting requirements applicable to covered entities.&nbsp;</span>Regular status updates are important, however, requiring constant reports is not useful and ties up critical response resources.</li>
<li><span>Reduce the amount of time firms are required to keep forensic data.&nbsp;</span>CISA should shorten the time that financial institutions are required to save data so they aren&rsquo;t forced to incur expenses for data that may no longer be necessary.</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Olumide Osunkoya Sentenced To 4 Years For Illegally Operating Crypto ATM Network</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-olumide-osunkoya-sentenced-to-4-years-for-illega-2025228/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-olumide-osunkoya-sentenced-to-4-years-for-illega-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Olumide Osunkoya, 46, was sentenced on 28 February 2025 to 4 years in prison for illegal crypto activity worth over &pound;2.5m and associated offences.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Osunkoya pleaded guilty on 30 September 2024 to 5 charges.</p>
<p>Between 30 December 2021 and 12 March 2022, Mr Osunkoya operated crypto ATMs at 28 different locations via his company, GidiPlus Ltd, despite being refused registration with the FCA. It is illegal to operate crypto ATMs in the UK without FCA registration.</p>
<p>Mr Osunkoya later transferred the machines from GidiPlus Ltd and personally operated a reduced network of up to 12 crypto ATMs under a false name and company to evade detection.</p>
<p>Mr Osunkoya failed to carry out the necessary checks to ensure that the ATMs were not being used by criminals to launder the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p>Mr Osunkoya was also convicted and sentenced for forgery, using false identity documents, and possessing criminal property.</p>
<p>At the hearing, the FCA requested the court initiate confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. These proceedings will look to recover any financial benefit Mr Osunkoya obtained as a result of his criminality.</p>
<p>Mr Osunkoya&rsquo;s sentence is the first for unregistered cryptoasset activity in the UK. It follows the FCA&rsquo;s operation, working in partnership with law enforcement agencies, to tackle illegal crypto ATMs across the country. In 2023, the FCA visited 38 locations and disrupted 30 machines. The number of crypto ATMs advertised on CoinATMRadar in the UK has fallen from more than 80 in 2022 to nil in 2024.</p>
<p>The FCA continues to warn people that if you buy crypto, you should be prepared to lose all your money. Crypto remains largely unregulated in the UK and is high risk.</p>
<p>In sentencing, His Honour Judge Perrins remarked:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your decision to continue to operate illegally was an act of deliberate and calculated defiance to the regulator... You knew full well that you were acting unlawfully... You went to great lengths to create a false identity to conceal your involvement... Your actions were deliberate and carefully planned... It cannot be said that it is a mere regulatory breach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the UK&rsquo;s first criminal sentencing for unregistered crypto activity and sends a clear message: those who flout our rules, seek to evade detection and engage in criminal activity will face serious consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mr Osunkoya&rsquo;s date of birth is 7 February 1979.</li>
<li>The sentencing took place at Southwark Crown Court.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-charges-first-individual-running-network-illegal-crypto-atms" title="FCA charges first individual with running a network of illegal crypto ATMs">FCA charges first individual with running a network of illegal crypto ATMs</a>.</li>

<li>Mr Osunkoya has admitted guilt to 5 offences. The first 2 offences were operating a network of crypto ATMs without the required FCA permission, first as the director of GidiPlus Ltd and secondly as a sole trader. The third offence was committing forgery, where Mr Osunkoya created 4 bank statements in an effort to pass source of wealth checks with a cryptoasset exchange provider. The fourth offence was using a false instrument, namely false identity documents in the name of his alias to incorporate a company under the control of that alias. The final offence was possessing criminal property, &pound;19,540 of cash which was obtained as a result of running the crypto ATM network.</li>
<li>Mr Osunkoya is understood to have made substantial profit from the operation, charging a typical markup on each transaction of between 30% and 60%.</li>
<li>GidiPlus Ltd applied for registration under the Money Laundering Regulations in 2020 and was refused in December 2021.</li>
<li>Crypto ATMs are machines that allow you to convert money into cryptoassets and/or cryptoassets into money.</li>
<li>The FCA has been the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) supervisor of UK cryptoasset businesses since 10 January 2020.</li>
<li>The FCA published a&nbsp;<a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/search?predefined=U">list of cryptoasset businesses</a>&nbsp;that are operating without our registration.</li>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Begins 2025 Survey Of Consumer Finances</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board in March will begin its regular study of household finances, the Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides the public and policymakers with detailed and important insights into the economic condition of American families.</p>
<p>"This survey is an important source of information on the financial well-being of American families," Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell said in a letter to prospective survey participants. "Our most recent survey, which took place in 2022, has been important to understanding the different ways that American families experienced the unusual economic conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic."</p>
<p>The data collected will provide a representative picture of what Americans own&mdash;from houses and cars to stocks and bonds&mdash;how and how much they borrow, and how they bank, as well as their feelings about their economic situation and that of the United States more broadly. Past study results have contributed to policy discussions regarding the evolution of housing as a key component of wealth, the recovery of households from the Great Recession, changes in the kinds and amount of credit used by families, and a broad range of other issues.</p>
<p>The current version of the survey has been undertaken every three years since 1983. It is being conducted through December of this year and for the Board by NORC, a social science research organization at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Participants in the study are chosen at random from 119 geographic areas, including metropolitan areas and rural counties across the United States, using a scientific sampling procedure. A representative of NORC contacts each potential participant personally to explain the study and request time for an interview.</p>
<p>Individual survey responses are kept strictly confidential. NORC uses names and addresses only for the administration of the survey and must destroy that identifying information at the close of the study. NORC is forbidden from giving the names and addresses of participants to anyone at the Federal Reserve or elsewhere, and that information is permanently destroyed after the survey is completed.</p>
<p>Summary results for the 2025 study will be published in late 2026 after all data from the survey have been assessed and analyzed. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/other20250228a1.pdf">letter</a>&nbsp;from Chair Powell will be mailed in mid-March to approximately 13,000 households urging their participation in the study.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Is Publishing Banks’ Effective Capital Headroom</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Starting today, FI will now publish banks&rsquo; effective CET 1 capital headroom every quarter. This will show how much of the banks&rsquo; buffer is available to cover losses before a bank breaches a regulatory requirement or its Pillar 2 guidance. By publishing this information, FI will make it easier for market participants and other stakeholders to interpret the banks&rsquo; capital headroom.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>In today's publication of Capital requirements for Swedish banks, Q4 2024, FI is also publishing what we are calling the banks' effective CET 1 capital headroom.</p>
<p>The effective CET 1 capital headroom shows how much of a bank's own buffer of CET 1 capital &ndash; in relation to the risk-weighted capital requirement and the Pillar 2 guidance &ndash; is available to cover losses without the bank breaching its regulatory requirements or the Pillar 2 guidance.</p>
<p>A bank's effective CET 1 capital headroom is defined as the amount in SEK &ndash; recalculated to a per cent of the risk exposure amount (REA) &ndash; for which the headroom between the bank's available capital and eligible liabilities and its regulatory requirement and Pillar 2 guidance is smallest.</p>
<p>This report, like previous publications of Capital requirements for Swedish banks, covers the three major banks, Handelsbanken, SEB and Swedbank, as well as L&auml;nsf&ouml;rs&auml;kringar, Klarna, Kommuninvest, Svenskt Exportkredit (SEK), SBAB, Avanza and Nordnet. We describe the method and other information that serve as a basis for the calculations in the memorandum Effective CET 1 capital headroom for banks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Finansinspektionen publishes the capital requirements of the largest Swedish banks and credit institutions that belong to supervisory categories 1 and 2 as of the end of Q4 2024.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>The capital requirements are published to illustrate the effect of Finansinspektionen's total capital requirement, including Pillar 2. Pillar 2 is a collective term for the rules that govern the firms' internal capital assessments and Finansinspektionen's supervisory review and evaluation process, of which Finansinspektionen's capital assessment forms an integral part.</p>
<p>As per Q4 2024, Finansinspektionen will publish the effective Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital headroom. The effective CET 1 capital headroom is defined as the amount in SEK &ndash; recalculated to a per cent of the risk exposure amount (REA) &ndash; for which the headroom between the bank's available capital and eligible liabilities and its regulatory requirement and Pillar 2 guidance is smallest. For more information about the method and underlying calculations see the memorandum Bankernas faktiska k&auml;rnprim&auml;rkapitalutrymme.</p>
<p>The capital requirements are published for Sweden's three major banks, Handelsbanken, SEB and Swedbank, as well as L&auml;nsf&ouml;rs&auml;kringar, Klarna, Kommuninvest, Svensk Exportkredit (SEK), SBAB, Avanza and Nordnet.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cme-group-to-launch-solana-sol-futures-on-march-17-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced plans to launch&nbsp;<span>Solana</span>&nbsp;(SOL) futures on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 17</span>, pending regulatory review. Market participants will have the choice to trade both a micro-sized contract (<span class="xn-money">25 SOL</span>) and a larger-sized contract (<span class="xn-money">500 SOL</span>).</p>
<p>"With the launch of our new SOL futures contracts, we are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;price risk," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Giovanni Vicioso</span>, Global Head of&nbsp;<span>Cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;Products at CME Group. "As&nbsp;<span>Solana</span>&nbsp;continues to evolve into the platform of choice for developers and investors, these new futures contracts will provide a capital-efficient tool to support their investment and hedging strategies."</p>
<p>CME Group SOL futures will be cash-settled and based on the CME CF&nbsp;<span>Solana</span>-Dollar Reference Rate, which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of SOL and is calculated daily at&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">4:00 p.m.</span>&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">London</span>&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>SOL futures will join the company's&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;product suite that includes&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and Ether futures and options futures.. Year-to-date trading highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average daily volume of 202,000 contracts, up 73% year-over-year</li>
<li>Average open interest of 243,600 contracts, up 55% year-over-year</li>
<li>More than 11,300 unique accounts trading</li>
</ul>
<p>"The launch of SOL futures is a significant milestone in the ongoing maturation of the&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;market," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Teddy Fusaro</span>, President of Bitwise Asset Management, Inc. "This announcement underscores CME Group's commitment to and leadership in offering institutional investors and active traders advanced tools for trading and risk management. With the introduction of&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and Ether futures, CME Group paved the way for the broader institutionalization of&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;as an asset class and set the stage for more regulated financial products such as ETFs to enter the market. The addition of these new contracts further demonstrates CME Group's leadership and its continued role in shaping the evolution of this dynamic asset class."</p>
<p>"Multicoin Capital applauds CME Group's continued innovation in the digital asset space and is proud to support the launch of their SOL derivatives offering," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Kyle Samani</span>, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, Multicoin Capital. "As the digital asset market matures and demand continues to grow, sophisticated investors need better ways to get exposure and manage volatility. CME Group's new&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;derivatives provide just that, giving investors increased flexibility with less upfront capital."</p>
<p>"The new SOL futures contracts are further examples of CME Group innovating in the retail&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;trading space for the benefit of customers," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Elad Even-Chen</span>, Group CFO of Plus500. "These contracts will bring a new dimension for retail futures traders and will help manage their&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;portfolios by allowing them to further diversify their holdings. We are proud to be supporting this latest product launch, which is based on scalable, well-established and trusted&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrencies</span>."</p>
<p>SOL futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME.

<title>Statement By SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw: Crypto 2.0: Regulatory Whiplash</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-by-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-crenshaw-crypto-20-regulatory-whip-2025228/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-by-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-crenshaw-crypto-20-regulatory-whip-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Today the Commission moved the Court to dismiss its enforcement action against Coinbase, a crypto trading platform. This reverse-course midstream &ndash; coupled with recent high-profile stays of other litigations &ndash; is not only unprecedented, it ignores 80 years of well-established law.&nbsp; We say we are dismissing the action because of future recommendations that may be made by the &ldquo;crypto task force dedicated to helping the Commission develop the regulatory framework for crypto assets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;But, whatever the law may be tomorrow, market participants should not be able to avoid the law as it stands today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission has brought numerous actions to enforce the securities laws with respect to crypto assets since their advent, during both Republican and Democratic administrations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;And, court after court has upheld the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction in this space.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;In fact, in the&nbsp;<em>Coinbase</em>&nbsp;matter the Commission moved to dismiss today, the court had found that the Commission adequately pleaded violations of the securities laws. The court explained that: &ldquo;[t]he SEC has a long history of proceeding through [enforcement] actions to regulate emerging technologies and financial instruments within the ambit of its authority as defined by cases like&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>[.] Using enforcement actions to address crypto-assets is simply the latest chapter in the long history of giving meaning to the securities laws through iterative application to new situations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The court also held that &ldquo;the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s action today blithely tosses aside that body of precedent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have heard many say that the industry craves legal clarity. Today&rsquo;s action results in less clarity. I have and will continue to work with participants who seek to operate within the securities laws. Or, should the Commission enact new regulations or Congress change the law, we can progress down a different path. But until that time, we have a framework in place and that framework should be applied and enforced equally as to all participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Far from clarity, today&rsquo;s action creates more uncertainty. What exactly is the law as it applies to crypto assets? How can we pursue fraudulent conduct in this space while casting doubt on our regulatory jurisdiction? Are we eroding our ability to police fraudulent Ponzi<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;schemes? Are we poised to give special treatment to crypto assets over traditional assets, or even other emerging assets? What effects will this have on our traditional markets and financial instruments? The newly created crypto task force may intend to make recommendations to answer some of these questions, but we do not have any legally enforceable answers yet. In fact, the most salient change to date has been this retreat from enforcement of the securities laws with respect to crypto.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Or, &ldquo;regulation by non-enforcement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may well be that &ldquo;environments in which the law is unclear are havens for bad actors,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;but wholesale failure to enforce the law seems worse. There are well known risks in this industry ̶&nbsp; fraud and manipulation, money laundering, national security concerns, volatility, and retail investor losses&nbsp; ̶&nbsp; just to name a few.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-2-0-regulatory-whiplash-022725#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, today&rsquo;s action undermines the credibility of our Division of Enforcement. It creates the specter that the agency will deploy its enforcement resources in conjunction with election cycles or in favor of those with means. This invites criticism that our agency is politicized and sows distrust in government. Our agency&rsquo;s job is to do what is right for investors, issuers, and capital markets. This is not it.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The Role Of The Digital Euro In Digital Payments And Finance - Contribution To Bancaria By Piero Cipollone, Member Of The Executive Board Of The ECB, Based On Remarks At The Crypto Asset Lab Conference On 17 January 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Being a key player in digital payments and digital finance should be a priority for Europe.</p>
<p>As Mario Draghi pointed out in his recent report, the productivity gap between the United States and the European Union is mostly explained by technology and finance.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;If we take the information and communications technology (ICT) and financial sectors out, the gap disappears.</p>
<p>If we want to close the productivity gap with the United States, we need to focus on these areas. Digital payments and digital finance stand at the intersection of these two sectors. And they are developing fast, driven by changes in habits and technology. This is both an opportunity and a risk for Europe. It is an opportunity to close the gap by developing innovative and competitive European solutions. But if we do not seize that opportunity, we run the risk of weakening our competitiveness, resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>At the European Central Bank (ECB), as guardians of our single currency, the euro, we consider this a matter of crucial importance. Ultimately, it is about the future of our currency. Today, the euro is the second most important currency in the international monetary system. Its share across a range of indicators stands at around 20%, and the euro area accounts for around 12% of global GDP.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;If we want to prevent the euro from losing importance on the global stage, transacting and investing in euro needs to be seen as safe, easy and efficient, even as digitalisation transforms payments and finance.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Central bank money &ndash; the central pillar of the payments and financial system &ndash; has a key role to play in connecting the different parts of the financial system in a safe and risk-free way. This is particularly relevant in Europe, where payments and finance often remain fragmented along national lines, preventing us from fully reaping the benefits of the single European market. This is true for both retail and wholesale transactions.</p>
<p>For retail transactions &ndash; payments made on a daily basis by consumers and businesses &ndash; our reliance on non-European solutions weakens our strategic autonomy and is a drag on productivity growth. We should ask, for example, why we don&rsquo;t have a European VISA or Mastercard. A digital euro &ndash; that is, central bank money in digital form for retail transactions &ndash; would give us the chance to increase efficiency, competition, innovation and resilience while allowing European private payment solutions to scale up and protect our monetary sovereignty.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>For wholesale transactions &ndash; transactions between financial institutions &ndash; we need to avoid repeating the mistake we made in the retail sector and ensure that we provide the conditions for European actors to stay ahead of their competitors. New technologies offer us the opportunity to create an integrated European market for digital assets from the outset, in other words a European capital markets union.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h2>A digital euro for everyday payments</h2>
<p>For firms and households, central bank money is currently only available in the form of cash; there is currently no equivalent in digital form, which is becoming increasingly problematic because the use and acceptance of cash are declining. In the euro area, cash transactions have fallen below card transactions in value.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;The share of companies reporting that they do not accept cash has tripled over the last three years to 12%.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;The European Commission has put forward a legislative proposal to ensure the acceptance of cash<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span>, and the ECB is committed to ensuring that cash remains as widely available and accessible as possible<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span>. Still, the trend towards cash being used less for daily transactions is likely to continue owing to the digitalisation of the economy in line with what has been observed in many advanced economies.</p>
<div class="figure">
<h4>Day-to-day payments in the euro area by payment instrument, in value terms</h4>

<p class="info">(percentage of the value of all non-recurring day-to-day payments)</p>
<img id="img0" src="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/in250228/ecb.in250228.en_img0.png?1e639cc4661c8c0e0f537707f0c824c6" /><figcaption>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Current European digital payment solutions, such as cards issued by European payment schemes, mainly cater to national markets and specific use cases. To pay across European countries, consumers have to rely on a few non-European providers. More than two-thirds of card transactions in the euro area were settled through international payment schemes in the second half of 2023.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And 13 out of 20 euro area countries rely entirely on non-European solutions in the absence of their own domestic payment scheme. But even those international payment solutions are not accepted everywhere and do not cover all key use cases.</p>
<div class="figure">
<h4>National card schemes in the euro area</h4>
<figure><img id="img1" src="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/in250228/ecb.in250228.en_img1.png?68e0d01ff8971c3ed06adebfab5922ad" /><figcaption>
<p>Source: ECB.</p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As a result, one of the key objectives of central bank money &ndash; to offer the public a means of payment backed by the sovereign authority that can be used for retail transactions across the entire currency area &ndash; is not being fulfilled in the digital space.</p>
<p>In addition, European payments have become a prime example of the situation that Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi described in their recent reports.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;The fragmentation of the market along national lines, the lack of European payment solutions available on a European scale and the difficulty faced by European payment service providers in keeping pace with technological advances mean that Europe is not competitive within its own market, let alone on a global scale.</p>
<p>Moreover, in an unstable geopolitical environment, we are being left to rely on companies based in other countries. In future, this dependency could extend beyond traditional payment service providers. Platforms like Ant Group&rsquo;s Alipay have shown they know how to bridge geographical gaps: during major events like UEFA EURO 2024 they were able to boost their payment app usage among customers in Europe.</p>
<p>Merchants &ndash; and consumers, who bear the costs &ndash; are left to deal with the consequences of the international card schemes&rsquo; market dominance. To give just one example, the average net merchant service charges in the EU almost doubled between 2018 and 2022.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This increase occurred despite regulatory efforts to contain it. And the cost falls disproportionately on smaller retailers, who face charges that are three to four times higher than those paid by their larger counterparts.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>We must move swiftly to counter the risks stemming from Europe&rsquo;s current inability to secure the integration and autonomy of its retail payment system. This is one of the key reasons behind the digital euro project: to bring central bank money into the digital age. Doing so would provide firms and households with a digital equivalent to banknotes and would strengthen our monetary sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Benefits for consumers and merchants</h3>
<p>Complementing banknotes, the digital euro would give all European citizens and firms the freedom to make and receive digital payments seamlessly.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk177571634"></a>The digital euro would provide a single, easy, secure and universally accepted public solution for digital payments in stores, online and from person to person. It would be available both online and offline, and would be free for basic use.</p>
<p>For merchants, the digital euro would provide seamless access to all European consumers. Moreover, it would offer an alternative that would increase competition, thereby lowering transaction costs in a more direct way than is possible through regulations and competition authorities.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h3>Fostering competition and innovation in an integrated payments ecosystem</h3>
<p>The digital euro would strengthen the euro area economy by fostering competition and innovation.</p>
<p>European payment service providers are finding it increasingly difficult to compete with international card schemes and mobile payment solutions. As the latter grow in popularity, banks risk falling behind not only in terms of interchange fees, but also in terms of client relationships and user data.</p>
<p>By contrast, the digital euro would ensure that payment service providers would continue to play a central role, thus enabling them to maintain customer relationships and be compensated for their services, as is currently the case.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;It would also offer an alternative to co-badging with international card schemes for cross-border payments in &ndash; and potentially beyond &ndash; the euro area, thus promoting competition.</p>
<p>The digital euro would also expand the opportunities available to payment service providers while reducing the cost of offering their own services on a European scale. In addition, it would foster an environment conducive to the widespread adoption of payment innovations throughout the euro area.</p>
<p>Currently, several innovations aimed at simplifying payments are emerging within specific national markets or across a few countries, driven by European payment service providers. Although these innovations are highly commendable and would enhance people&rsquo;s lives, existing structural barriers are hampering their efforts to achieve pan-European scale.</p>
<p>These solutions are struggling to achieve the scale needed to provide a service to everyone in the euro area. This limits their ability to compete effectively with the large international players who can fully leverage economies of scale, even on a global level.</p>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposal<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;foresees that the digital euro would have legal tender status; this implies that it would be accepted by all merchants who currently accept electronic payments. In reality this would equate to the creation of a pan-European network which could also be used by private solutions, thus overcoming the obstacles limiting their growth.</p>
<p>This would foster a more integrated European payments market. As private providers expand their geographical reach and diversify their product portfolios, they will benefit from cost efficiencies and be better positioned to compete internationally.</p>
<p>In essence, the network effects generated by a digital euro would function as a public good, benefiting both public and private initiatives. This approach would be akin to creating a unified European railway network or European energy grid, where various companies could competitively operate their own services and deliver added value to customers.</p>
<p>Instead of requiring significant investment to expand existing services across the euro area, the open digital euro standards would facilitate cost-effective standardisation, making it possible for private retail payment solution providers to launch new products and functionalities on a broader scale.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether through the digital euro or private solutions, this framework would unlock innovation, create new business opportunities and improve consumer access to a diverse range of goods and services.</p>
<h3>Making this vision a shared reality</h3>
<p>The design of the digital euro, as well as the key provision in the regulation proposed by the European Commission, contains all the key elements required to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>Over the past years, we have extensively engaged with a multitude of market stakeholders to establish the digital euro&rsquo;s features. We have collected and discussed the input of representatives of consumers, merchants, banks and payment service providers. Furthermore, we are now looking at how the digital euro could be used to provide services currently not available on the market. To this end, we launched a call for expressions of interest, asking for collaboration from stakeholders, and we received a very strong response. Through this inclusive approach, we want to take everyone&rsquo;s needs and perspectives into consideration to produce a robust payments solution.</p>
<h2>The role of central bank money in developing a European market for digital assets</h2>
<p>Currently, the ECB and the national central banks of those EU Member States whose currency is the euro (which we collectively refer to as the Eurosystem) offer central bank money in digital form to financial institutions through our TARGET Services: T2 settles more than 90% of the value of large payments between financial institutions, and T2S settles securities transactions. These services have been crucial in increasing the efficiency and integration of post-trade platforms in Europe.</p>
<p>We are committed to continuing to provide state-of-the-art settlement services in central bank money, even as new technologies emerge.</p>
<h3>The potential of new technologies</h3>
<p>In this respect, we recognise the potential of new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT), to transform and improve wholesale financial markets by enabling assets to be issued or represented in digital token form.</p>
<p>DLT allows market participants to handle trading, settlement and custody on the same platform, reducing credit risk, transaction failures and reconciliation needs. It can enhance efficiency by operating on a 24/7, 365 days a year basis and settling transactions instantly, which could potentially reduce annual infrastructure operational costs. A shared DLT platform could lower market entry barriers, enable small and medium-sized enterprises and new players to access capital markets and facilitate the efficient trading of financial instruments currently not covered on regulated markets.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to create an integrated European capital market for digital assets from the outset &ndash; in other words, a digital capital markets union.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In fact, we have recently seen an upsurge in DLT initiatives in Europe. Over 60% of EU banks are exploring or using DLT, with 22% already implementing DLT applications. Furthermore, on the securities side, there has been an increasing number of issuances on DLT.</p>
<h3>The role of central bank money and the Eurosystem&rsquo;s exploratory work</h3>
<p>The ECB is aware that it has a role to play in this work from the very beginning.</p>
<p>The availability of central bank money to settle transactions using these new technologies is important for two reasons. First, if we don&rsquo;t use central bank money, other settlement assets &ndash; such as stablecoins or tokenised deposits &ndash; will be used, which would reintroduce credit risks and fragmentation in the financial system. And second, the possibility to settle in central bank money is seen by the market as a key factor in the adoption of new technologies.</p>
<p>The Eurosystem has already worked with the market to test settling wholesale transactions in central bank money using DLT. In exploratory work we carried out in 2024, for example, we offered three different solutions to link our TARGET services to market DLT platforms. This allowed industry participants to either settle real transactions in central bank money or conduct experiments with mock transactions.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>This exploratory work stands out at the global level in terms of its scale and scope. Overall, 60 industry participants took part, including incumbents and new entrants. More than 40 experiments and trials covered a wide range of securities and payments use cases, including the first issuance of an EU sovereign bond using DLT. A total value of &euro;1.6 billion was settled via trials over a six-month period, exceeding values settled in comparable initiatives in other jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>In the short term, the Eurosystem will aim to make it possible to settle DLT transactions in central bank money, with a view to enabling the further development of DLT on the market.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/inter/date/2025/html/ecb.in250228~7c25c90e4d.en.html#footnote.20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;The technological solution will be based on interoperability between market DLTs and the Eurosystem, but also &ndash; and this is crucial &ndash; between market platforms, based on strong and enforceable standards.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, we will investigate how DLT can be used to create a more integrated financial market. With new technology, there is the opportunity to create a new ecosystem from scratch in a more integrated and harmonised manner. One way to achieve this integrated ecosystem in the longer term would be to move towards a European shared ledger. This would bring together token versions of central bank money, commercial bank money and other digital assets on a shared, programmable platform, on which market participants could provide their services. Another option could be the coordinated development of an ecosystem of fully interoperable technical solutions, which might better serve specific use cases and enable legacy and new solutions to coexist.</p>
<p>The trade-offs between the benefits of such flexibility and those of bringing everyone together on one platform need further analysis. We will reflect on these trade-offs and refine this long-term vision together with private and public sector stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the current fast-moving environment, Europe cannot stand still. If we do not bring central bank money into the digital age, we will hamper Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness, resilience and strategic autonomy. And we will miss out on the opportunities that digital payments and digital finance offer. Others would reap the benefits instead.</p>
<p>By ensuring that central bank money keeps pace with digitalisation and new technologies, we would safeguard our monetary sovereignty. We would overcome fragmentation by offering money that can be used for any digital transactions in the euro area. We would foster competition and innovation. And we would strengthen our autonomy and resilience.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Succeeds In Continuous Disclosure Claims Against CBL Chief Financial Officer</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-succeeds-in-continuous-disclosure-claims-2025228/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-succeeds-in-continuous-disclosure-claims-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The High Court has found former CBL Group Chief Financial Officer, Carden Mulholland, to have breached the continuous disclosure provisions of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA), following the public listing of CBL Corporation (CBLC) in October 2015 and its subsequent collapse in February 2018. The judgment follows a trial in the Auckland High Court before Justice Gault, which commenced in late June 2024 and concluded in early August 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; proceeded to trial against Mr Mulholland, having reached in-court settlements with CBLC, its Managing Director Peter Harris, and its former independent non-executive directors in 2023 and 2024, which saw them admit multiple contraventions and the Court make pecuniary penalty orders.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time New Zealand Courts have considered the liability of a chief financial officer (CFO) acting as an accessory to a company&rsquo;s contravention under the FMCA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s case against Mr Mulholland centred on his role as CFO of the CBL Group (for which CBLC was the parent company) and as a member of CBLC&rsquo;s Disclosure Committee. He was also a director of CBLC&rsquo;s European subsidiary, CBL Insurance Europe dac (CBLIE). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement Margot Gatland said: &ldquo;The judgment represents a significant step in the case brought by the FMA against CBLC, its directors and its CFO in the wake of CBLC&rsquo;s collapse. &nbsp;It sets an important precedent for holding a CFO accountable for an entity&rsquo;s continuous disclosure breaches and provides judicial guidance for senior executives of listed entities in respect of the continuous disclosure requirements. The FMA considers the findings of liability against Mr Mulholland reflect serious misconduct by a senior officer of CBLC who failed to comply with fundamental obligations of the continuous disclosure regime.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Judge found that Mr Mulholland had the required level of knowledge and participation in the conduct to make him personally liable, as an accessory, to three of CBLC&rsquo;s continuous disclosure contraventions. These related to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The existence and impact on regulatory solvency of approximately $35 million of aged receivables (insurance premiums owed to CBLI but not paid to it). &nbsp;This issue was known to CBLC by 24 August 2017 but not disclosed to the market until 5 February 2018.</li>
<li>The need for CBLI to strengthen its reserves by approximately $100 million. &nbsp;This was known to CBLC by 25 January 2018 but not disclosed to the market until 5 February 2018.</li>
<li>A direction issued to CBLIE by its prudential regulator, the Central Bank of Ireland, requiring CBLIE to hold additional cash reserves of &euro;31.5 million. &nbsp;This was known to CBLC by 30 January 2018 at the latest but not disclosed to the market until 7 February 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision provides guidance to listed issuers, their directors and senior officers as to the scope of their obligations under the continuous disclosure regime. In particular:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessory liability for continuous disclosure obligations is not necessarily limited to board members. Where senior officers of listed companies are aware of material information, it is part of their role to ensure the board is made aware of the information and that the board has considered the issue of its disclosure. &nbsp;</li>
<li>If an officer is aware that the board has failed to consider the disclosure of that material information, or there is a real risk the board has not considered the need for disclosure, then a failure to prompt consideration of disclosure may lead to accessory liability for the senior officer. This is particularly so where the senior officer has specific continuous disclosure responsibilities under the company&rsquo;s policies and procedures.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Court concluded Mr Mulholland was not liable in respect of two further causes of action:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A fourth continuous disclosure cause of action that related to a transaction the Judge found to be conditional and to not have a material impact on solvency. &nbsp;</li>
<li>A cause of action brought under the fair dealing provisions of the FMCA relating to a market announcement in August 2017 detailing a &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; increase to CBLI&rsquo;s reserves. While the Court determined that CBLC contravened the FMCA in respect of this announcement, it held Mr Mulholland was not an accessory to that contravention. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Judge also found an alternative cause of action, relating to the collective effect of the conduct, unnecessary to address given his findings in respect of the other contraventions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Court will now set down a hearing to determine the appropriate penalty for Mr Mulholland in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Related matters &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A related proceeding brought by the FMA alleging breaches of the FMCA by CBLC, Mr Harris, Mr Mulholland and Mr Hutchison at the time of CBLC&rsquo;s Initial Public Offering in 2015 is set down for a six-week trial commencing 13 April 2026 in the Auckland High Court. Mr Hutchison died in 2021 and the claim continues against his estate.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Getting Back On Base: Statement Of SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce On The Dismissal Of The Civil Enforcement Action Against Coinbase</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/getting-back-on-base-statement-of-sec-commissioner-hester-m-peirce-on-the-dism-2025228/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/getting-back-on-base-statement-of-sec-commissioner-hester-m-peirce-on-the-dism-2025228/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today the Commission settled its case against Coinbase by dismissing it with prejudice. I did not support the action against Coinbase. Among other things, I was concerned that it was part of the Commission&rsquo;s larger strategy to use its enforcement tool to regulate the crypto industry. Typically, developing regulations to address new industries and business practices is the province of the Commission&rsquo;s capable, expert policy divisions. The decision by the previous Commission to shift this function to the Division of Enforcement by engaging in a large-scale regulation-by-enforcement initiative harmed the American public, adversely affected the industry, and impeded the ability of the Commission&rsquo;s skilled and dedicated professional staff to use their expertise as it was intended to be used.</p>
<p>The American public suffered because environments in which the law is unclear are havens for bad actors and hostile territory for law-abiding people legitimately trying to solve society&rsquo;s problems and meet its needs. The lack of clarity creates an added layer of uncertainty for startups and ultimately may drive these innovators and entrepreneurs to other economic sectors or jurisdictions with clearer regulatory lines. Bad actors, by contrast, hide between regulatory jurisdictions and use the blurry lines to confuse consumers. As a consequence, Americans enjoyed fewer of the fruits of innovation and more of the distress of predation over recent years than they would have in a clear regulatory regime.</p>
<p>The Commission took a sweeping and difficult-to-decipher approach in its application of&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;to the crypto industry. The industry suffered because effort that would have gone into building interesting and innovative products and services instead went into strategizing with costly lawyers to determine how best to avoid regulatory liability. In the action against Coinbase, the Commission leveled only registration charges premised on Coinbase&rsquo;s listing of tokens swept up by this expansive&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;analysis. Many other Commission actions followed a similar approach. Token issuers (often not party to the suits), other industry participants, and their counsel were left to divine whether the Commission would deem a particular product a security from clues dropped into the Commission&rsquo;s complaints in myriad crypto-related cases.</p>
<p>Finally, the regulation-by-enforcement strategy ill-served the Commission&rsquo;s staff. Although staff represent the Commission in court and their names are on Commission filings, the ultimate decision about whether to institute or settle enforcement actions lies with the Commission. The Commission&rsquo;s vote to institute or settle an enforcement action is not a mere formality, and the Commission bears sole responsibility for its decisions. The Commission&mdash;unwisely in my view&mdash;chose not to use its policy tools but instead relied on a series of enforcement actions to write crypto policy. Regardless of their own policy preferences, the Commission&rsquo;s talented enforcement staff, who report to the Chairman, crafted an enforcement program that reflected this choice. The enforcement staff appropriately worked hard to execute as effectively as possible the Commission&rsquo;s directives to pursue approved enforcement actions. Meanwhile, the Commission&rsquo;s policy staff could not engage productively with the public to build a workable regulatory framework for crypto absent a Commission directive to do so. Such a directive was absent for the past four years.</p>
<p>The current Commission has now issued such a directive with the formation of the Crypto Task Force: It is the policy staff who will take the lead in engaging with the public to build a regulatory framework that serves the American public. This new approach drives today&rsquo;s dismissal of the charges against Coinbase, but it does not signal an end to the Commission&rsquo;s use of its enforcement tool in appropriate cases.</p>

<title>Staff Statement On Meme Coins, SEC Division Of Corporation Finance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/staff-statement-on-meme-coins-sec-division-of-corporation-finance-2025227/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/staff-statement-on-meme-coins-sec-division-of-corporation-finance-2025227/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As part of an effort to provide greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets, the Division of Corporation Finance is providing its views<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;on &ldquo;meme coins.&rdquo; A &ldquo;meme coin&rdquo; is a type of crypto asset<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;inspired by internet memes, characters, current events, or trends for which the promoter seeks to attract an enthusiastic online community to purchase the meme coin and engage in its trading. Although individual meme coins may have unique features, meme coins typically share certain characteristics. Meme coins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. In this regard, meme coins are akin to collectibles. Meme coins also typically have limited or no use or functionality. Given the speculative nature of meme coins, they tend to experience significant market price volatility, and often are accompanied by statements regarding their risks and lack of utility, other than for entertainment or other non-functional purposes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>It is the Division&rsquo;s view that transactions in the types of meme coins described in this statement, do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;As such, persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (&ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) or fall within one of the Securities Act&rsquo;s exemptions from registration. Accordingly, neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 each defines the term &ldquo;security&rdquo; by providing a list of various financial instruments, including &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; &ldquo;note,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bond.&rdquo; A meme coin does not constitute any of the common financial instruments specifically enumerated in the definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo; because, among other things, it does not generate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business. In other words, a meme coin is not itself a security. The aforementioned statutory sections also provide that &ldquo;investment contracts&rdquo; are securities. Given that a meme coin is not itself a security, we conduct our analysis of whether a meme coin may be offered and sold as part of an investment contract under the &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; test set forth in&nbsp;<em>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.</em><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;test analyzes whether certain arrangements or instruments are investment contracts based on their &ldquo;economic realities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In evaluating the economic realities of a transaction, the&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;test considers whether there is an investment in an enterprise premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Federal courts since&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;have explained that&nbsp;<em>Howey&rsquo;s&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;efforts of others&rdquo; requirement is satisfied when &ldquo;the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The offer and sale of meme coins does not involve an investment in an enterprise nor is it undertaken with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. First, meme coin purchasers are not making an investment in an enterprise. That is, their funds are not pooled together to be deployed by promoters or other third parties for developing the coin or a related enterprise. Second, any expectation of profits that meme coin purchasers have is not derived from the efforts of others. That is, the value of meme coins is derived from speculative trading and the collective sentiment of the market, like a collectible. Moreover, the promoters of meme coins are not undertaking (or indicating an intention to undertake) managerial and entrepreneurial efforts from which purchasers could reasonably expect profit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this statement does not extend to the offer and sale of meme coins that are inconsistent with the descriptions set forth above, or products that are labeled &ldquo;meme coins&rdquo; in an effort to evade the application of the federal securities laws by disguising a product that otherwise would constitute a security.&nbsp; As noted above, the Division will evaluate the economic realities of the particular transaction.</p>
<p>Further, although the offer and sale of meme coins may not be subject to the federal securities laws, fraudulent conduct related to the offer and sale of meme coins may be subject to enforcement action or prosecution by other federal or state agencies under other federal and state laws.</p>

<hr size="1" />
<p><a href="https://dcmtrain.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-meme-coins#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This statement represents the views of the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance (the &ldquo;Division&rdquo;). The statement is not a rule, regulation, guidance, or statement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;Commission&rdquo;), and the Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content.

<title>SEC Announces Dismissal Of Civil Enforcement Action Against Coinbase</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-dismissal-of-civil-enforcement-action-against-coinbase-2025227/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the Commission has filed a joint stipulation with Coinbase Inc. and Coinbase Global Inc. to dismiss the ongoing civil enforcement action against the two entities.</p>
<p>On January 21, 2025, the Commission announced the formation of the Crypto Task Force, which is dedicated to helping develop a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets. Given the pending work of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/crypto-task-force">Crypto Task Force</a>, the Commission is dismissing this matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the last several years, the Commission&rsquo;s views on crypto have been largely expressed through enforcement actions without engaging the general public,&rdquo; said Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the Commission to rectify its approach and develop crypto policy in a more transparent manner. The Crypto Task Force is designed to do just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s decision to exercise its discretion and dismiss this pending enforcement action rests on its judgment that the dismissal will facilitate the Commission&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry, not on any assessment of the merits of the claims alleged in the action. Furthermore, as stated in the joint stipulation, &ldquo;the Commission&rsquo;s decision to seek dismissal of this litigation does not reflect the Commission&rsquo;s position on any other case.&rdquo; The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-42">Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit</a>&nbsp;will root out those seeking to misuse innovation to harm investors, including fraud involving blockchain technology and crypto assets.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Justinas Butkus With Orchestrating $4 Million Fraud - Butkus Used Fraudulent Investment Firms TBO Capital And Gray Capital To Scam Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Justinas Butkus, of Lithuania, and two companies he owned and controlled, HMC Trading LLC and HMC Management LLC, for fraudulently raising approximately $4.1 million from 64 investors by selling interests in mutual funds that did not exist.</p>
<p>As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, in late 2021, Butkus, under the alias Darius Karpavicius, operated fictitious investment firms TBO Capital Group and Gray Capital Group and offered investors shares in sham mutual funds through the firms&rsquo; websites, a press release, and internet advertisements, all of which made numerous materially false and misleading statements. According to the complaint, these websites and other materials falsely stated, among other things, that the TBO Capital and Gray Capital mutual funds were managed by industry professionals with decades of experience and achieved years of high-yield investment returns. In reality, the complaint alleges, the managers did not exist, their biographies were fake, and TBO Capital Group and Gray Capital Group never made any investments. Rather, as alleged, the entire operation was a fraud run by Butkus to enrich himself. Butkus allegedly used some of the investors' money to operate his fraudulent scheme, but stole most for his personal benefit, such as dining at restaurants, cash withdrawals, and crypto asset purchases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butkus&rsquo; conduct was egregious: He went to great lengths to defraud unsuspecting investors using sophisticated websites, internet advertisements, and an alias complete with a doctored passport,&rdquo; said Samuel Waldon, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;This case underscores the SEC&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to hold individuals accountable for engaging in fraud that harms retail investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC is refiling this action, which it voluntarily dismissed on January 11, 2024, against Butkus&rsquo;s alias, &ldquo;Darius Karpavicius,&rdquo; through a dismissal without prejudice.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Butkus, HMC Trading LLC, and HMC Management LLC with violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and names another Butkus-controlled entity, DK Auto LLC, as a relief defendant. The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each of the defendants. It also seeks disgorgement with interest from the relief defendant.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Benjamin Vaughn, Katherine H. Stella, and Andrea Fox with assistance from the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. It was supervised by Peter Rosario, George Bagnall, and Stacy L. Bogert. The litigation will be led by Peter Lallas and supervised by James Connor.&nbsp;The SEC appreciates the assistance of Homeland Security Investigations&rsquo; New York Field Office and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York.</p>

<title>Community Banking, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Robbins Banking Institute Lecture Series, Hays, Kansas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>It is a pleasure to join you today at Fort Hays State University for the Robbins Banking Institute Lecture.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250227a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I have been a supporter of this institute since it was first created here at Fort Hays State, including by giving a lecture to students during my tenure as the Kansas State Bank Commissioner. Today, my view is slightly different than at that time, and I thought it would be a good time to share my thoughts on the critical role community banks play, not only in the U.S. banking system but also as drivers of local and regional economic growth and as anchors of their local communities. I will also explore the responsibility of bank regulators to support community banks.</p>
<p>In a broad and diverse economy, banks of all sizes play an important role in the creation and funding of business and consumer opportunities and investments. Without this diverse banking ecosystem, 30 percent of American communities would not have access to a physical bank location. There is little doubt that community banks have an extensive presence across this landscape and that they are essential to the success of the American economy.</p>
<p>No other country in the world enjoys this direct access to and presence of financial services in remote and rural areas. These bankers are members of the community. They are neighbors and friends, and their kids attend local schools and play sports in the local recreational league. The term "relationship" banking has true meaning in this context.</p>
<p>The direct relationships provide an opportunity for bankers to understand the unique financing needs of local businesses and enables them to develop specialized services for specific segments of the local economy, including agriculture and small business lending.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250227a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Community banks are catalysts for local economic growth, and their bankers often also serve as civic leaders in the region. I served as one of those community leaders while I was a banker in Council Grove. That experience&mdash;whether serving as the President of the local Chamber of Commerce or the Rotary Club&mdash;provided a unique view into the local economy. And today, as I travel across the country to visit with bankers in just about every state, I learn about how they are driving investment, philanthropy, and financial support for the local economy. While this work is rewarding, it is also challenging. It is sometimes tedious&mdash;especially in today's regulatory environment&mdash;and it is a seven days a week job. Bankers are often "working" while engaged in social activities, attending church or their kids athletic events, and shopping at the grocery store, and I often hear about customers giving a loan payment to their banker in the grocery store or asking about financing terms for the new car they might have their eye on.</p>
<p>Once a policymaker grasps the perspective of community banking from this vantage point, it becomes clear that the regulatory approach is much more complex than necessary to address many small bank issues. A community bank that has no out-of-market customers applying for new accounts likely does not need the same know-your-customer processes as a large or regional bank that opens accounts online and may be more vulnerable to fraud. A community bank can operate safely and soundly, and in compliance with laws, without being subject to the same extensive guidance and regulatory requirements as larger, more complex banks that offer a broader range of products and may be exposed to wider range of risks. A number of onerous requirements imposed on community banks seem to reflect an assumption of an indirect and less personal banking relationship.</p>
<p>Public debates about the banking system often feature academics that tend to downplay the significant role of community banks in the financial system. Instead, they imagine a banking system with fewer banks as equally effective in meeting the banking needs of every community throughout the United States. The eight largest U.S. banks hold $15.4 trillion in assets, which is several times larger than the assets controlled by the more than 4,000 community banks in the United States.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250227a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;But as we all know, aggregate asset size is not an accurate indication of these banks' importance.</p>
<p>Of course, metrics do not provide the full picture of how relationship-based lending practices drive local economic activity. They ignore that banking has a regional component, where local knowledge and expertise&mdash;and a commitment to the local community&mdash;can help enable the community to thrive. There is an important place for the largest banks and regional banks in the banking system, but it is a fallacy to assume that the presence of fewer community banks would not have devastating consequences for a number of consumers and businesses. Some community banks serve rural and underserved banking markets and may be the only option for consumers and businesses, especially those that have unique balance sheets or less pristine credit histories. If community banks were to disappear, many communities would be left with few or no alternative options for banking services.</p>
<p>While metrics do not tell the whole story, this is not meant to downplay the importance of data, research, and analysis, all of which assist us in our understanding of the banking system and how that understanding could be improved. Data can help us identify issues that must be addressed or remediated. Data can help us evaluate which elements of the current bank regulatory framework may be effective or ineffective. And data can help regulators update regulations and guidance with a clearer understanding of the intended and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, we have seen the number of community banks continue to decline. Bank consolidation through mergers has contributed to this decline, and de novo bank formation has been largely nonexistent. Many factors have contributed to the bank consolidation trend, including competition from nonbank financial service providers and the ever-increasing regulatory burdens on the community banking model. Many of these same challenges have acted as a deterrent to bankers who have considered pursuing a de novo bank charter. And while many factors influence the health of the community bank model&mdash;including the interest rate environment, economic conditions, and alternative sources of competition for credit&mdash;we should consider whether there are actions regulators can take to support and ensure the future of community banks.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Experience</strong><br />One of the biggest barriers to the community bank model is the competition for qualified bank management and staff. Attracting, developing, and retaining future and current bank leadership is a significant challenge. Yet, one of the most important priorities for bank management is to develop the next generation of leadership. Educational programs like this institute, bank and regulator internships, and regional graduate schools of banking can help develop this pipeline of talent to support the industry and supervisory responsibilities. These programs also help regulators recruit the next generation of bank examiners.</p>
<p>Working in my family's community bank reinforced the mission focus and relationship model of community banking for me. This holds true for many family-owned community banks across the country.</p>
<p>Since we are on the campus of Fort Hays State University today and we have a number of students in the audience, part of my message today is to encourage each of you to consider exploring a career in the financial services industry&mdash;including in community banking or with a state or federal banking regulator. Whether that experience becomes a lifelong career or a stepping stone along your path, having experience in banking provides valuable perspective on how local economies function and the importance of access to banking services and financial inclusion. This experience has helped to shape my perspective and approach as the state bank commissioner and as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>This experience is also not something that I take for granted&mdash;seeing different perspectives empowers me to be a better policymaker. For example, as a bank compliance officer you understand the challenges of ensuring the bank is in compliance with rules and guidance and is prepared for interactions with bank examiners. Further, having this perspective enables a policymaker to approach the process of drafting rules and guidance and relaying supervisory messages in a way that recognizes a need for clarity, efficiency, and simplicity. The outcomes of our work are enhanced by a better understanding of the costs and unintended consequences of getting it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>The Responsibility of Regulators</strong><br />Overregulation and unnecessary rules and guidance imposed on smaller and community banks create disproportionate burdens on these banks, eventually eroding the viability of the community banking model.</p>
<p>Policymakers and regulators have a responsibility to ensure that the banking and financial systems encourage growth and innovation and foster a strong and growing economy. One of the great strengths of the U.S. banking system is the variety of institutions that meet the needs of consumers and businesses, not only through offering a range of products and services but also by reaching customers throughout the country, including in the most rural and remote locations. Our goal must be to facilitate a banking and regulatory environment that enables banks of all types and sizes to thrive. For community banks, this includes building a better regulatory and supervisory framework to effectively support the unique characteristics of these institutions.</p>
<p>What should that framework look like?</p>
<p>First, it includes thresholds that better reflect risk and business model.</p>
<p>As currently defined, community banks are those with less than $10 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve divides banks into distinct supervisory portfolios that oversee "community," "regional," and four categories of larger banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250227a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The portfolio approach helps regulators differentiate standards and supervisory focus based on bank characteristics and risks. In theory, it allows examiners to better organize supervisory activities and to provide specialized training to help examiners focus on issues that are most relevant for the institutions being examined. If appropriately executed, this portfolio-based approach should lead to better and more risk-focused supervision, and in turn a safer and more sound banking system.</p>
<p>An organizational structure that better allocates and directs supervisory resources seems like a worthwhile goal, but over time, it becomes clear that there are downsides to this approach. One of these downsides is the static nature of the fixed thresholds defining the categories. Currently, our framework includes fixed thresholds that are not adjusted with economic growth, inflation, or the growth in deposits from unexpected sources and fiscal programs, like those from the COVID era. They also do not account for changed industry dynamics, especially those resulting from a particular bank's activities or risk profile. In this environment, some firms with stable growth, a static business model, and a straightforward risk profile cross the $10 billion threshold unintentionally, subjecting them to additional regulatory and supervisory requirements that were specifically designed and implemented for larger and more complex firms. Banks approaching the $10 billion threshold often choose to curtail their asset growth to stay below the threshold.</p>
<p>Another significant problem with the current approach&mdash;that specifically challenges community banks&mdash;is the failure to index and update how a community bank is defined. Given the low fixed-dollar asset thresholds, regulators must focus on ensuring that asset-based benchmarks remain reasonable and appropriate in their work to supervise banks, especially as they apply tailored, but static, supervisory standards. As is the case now, over time, economic growth and inflation have created an environment in which thresholds are inappropriately low.</p>
<p>We also need to implement a better, more timely, transparent, and viable path for all bank regulatory applications. The application process can be a significant obstacle to applications activity, in particular mergers and acquisitions. Applications often experience significant delays between the application filing date and before receiving final regulatory approval. In some cases, even for non-complex transactions, the regulatory approval process has taken more than a year. A healthy banking system is one in which banks can make decisions to merge with peers or acquire new assets or business lines, and one that allows new bank formation, in a reasonable amount of time in accordance with statutory timelines. As the bank applications process has become a barrier to bank merger activity, we have seen credit unions acquiring community banks in record numbers. In the absence of a better functioning bank applications process, institutions will explore other options, including credit union acquisitions.</p>
<p>I think this trend should be a wake up call for regulators to reevaluate our approaches to many areas of our responsibility, but especially whether our applications processes are operating as effectively and efficiently as they should. It is important that the regulatory framework ensures that competition and broader availability of banking services remain a feature of the U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>A necessary approach to solving this is by making targeted improvements to the applications process. If you follow my work, you know that I often discuss how the applications process can be improved.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250227a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;So I will note some of the important changes that I believe would be a catalyst to returning our bank applications review function to an appropriate processing timeline. These are simply threshold steps that should be easy to accomplish and would be a great start to fundamentally improving the process.</p>
<p>I believe that we should not be complacent when facing excessive and longstanding delays. For bank applications, we must focus our resources and expertise to review and promptly act on all bank applications, to streamline the required forms and procedures, and to provide clear standards for approval.</p>
<p>Bank regulators should be prepared to act promptly on applications, and yet the significant delays in applications processing we see suggests we can do better. The published statistics on applications processing also tell an incomplete story, as they do not reflect the time spent by applicants who withdraw applications before final regulatory action or that simply forgo business opportunities that require an application out of concern that the regulatory approval process is too uncertain and unpredictable.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250227a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>Many banks experience these frictions in the applications process firsthand. And judging from the number of bankers that contact me as they experience unexplained and prolonged delays, there is clear need for improvement. Uncertainty regarding the status of the application and an expected timeline for resolution creates challenges in moving forward with related business processes often resulting in costly delays for systems conversions and unhealthy uncertainty among bank staff.</p>
<p>We can certainly learn from the inefficiencies in the current process and leverage these experiences by consulting with banks about these challenges and identifying a clear path to improve the process. One step could be to ensure that our applications teams have access to specialized knowledge required to more effectively approach applications for infrequent activities, like de novo formations. We should ensure that a Reserve Bank has the resources necessary to assist them in making the applications process smooth, and ensuring prompt action is taken on the application.</p>
<p>We also know that the applications process itself can be a significant barrier and has in recent years been used by regulators to delay decisions. While many activities that require regulatory approval rely on common application forms, some bank applications require regulatory approvals from multiple regulators. Even where only one primary federal regulator must act on an application, there may be requirements to solicit views from other regulators, or the need to request additional information from the applicant that was not included in the initial filing forms.</p>
<p>Each additional step in the process can lead to delays and prolonged uncertainty. Without question, there is a better process, and it should start with aligned requirements across the banking agencies, coordinated review processes, and clearer standards for approval.</p>
<p>The standards for approval should be clear to all applicants and consistently applied. This must include transparency not only in approval standards but also in timelines, which are equally critical to banks seeking regulatory approval. Banking applications are not filed without extensive work up front and specific plans in mind. For example, a merger application will include information about the pro forma institution's management team, geographies to be served in the merged institution's banking footprint, what products will be offered, and how the application will be consistent with the various statutory approval standards.</p>
<p>If we determine that we consistently need more information to process an application, we should amend the applications form instead of relying on time-consuming additional information requests that extend the decision timeline. And if there are standards we expect applicants to meet&mdash;for example, the minimum amount of capital required for a de novo bank formation or an expansionary proposal&mdash;we should be clear and transparent about those expectations in advance.</p>
<p>Uncertainty in the standards and timelines for action on bank applications can contribute to a regulatory environment that favors nonbanks. This more favorable treatment includes allowing them to engage in the same activities without the same regulatory burdens, like more favorable tax and regulatory treatment for credit unions and the exemption from Community Reinvestment Act requirements for nonbank financial institutions, again, including credit unions. Why would a new business choose to become a bank if they can avoid the complexities of the banking regulatory framework and still provide similar services?</p>
<p><strong>Tailoring</strong><br />While these steps&mdash;developing a pipeline of future leadership for community banks and promoting a more efficient bank applications process&mdash;would help support the community banking system generally, perhaps the most critical feature of the framework that affects community banks is tailoring to address the ongoing burden of compliance.</p>
<p>Tailoring is the term we use in banking to describe an approach to regulation that strives to match regulation and supervision with the size, risk, complexity, and business model of an institution. Tailoring helps us calibrate regulation and supervision to the activities and risks at every tier within our framework, but it is particularly important when we think about its application for smaller and community banks.</p>
<p>Frankly, when you consider the fundamental differences between the largest banks and the smallest, tailoring seems like common sense rather than a distinct regulatory philosophy. But in the absence of industry experience among bank policymakers, the trend over time has been an erosion of tailoring in favor of one-size-fits-all approaches.</p>
<p>Pushing down requirements more appropriate for larger institutions to smaller banks&mdash;either formally through regulation or informally through supervisory messaging&mdash;encourages homogenization of the industry. This trend becomes even more concerning when regulators "grade on a curve" by evaluating a bank&nbsp;<em>relative&nbsp;</em>to other institutions, instead of evaluating a bank&nbsp;<em>against a clear legal standard</em>.</p>
<p>It is also important for regulators evaluating regulations and supervisory approach to consider the aggregate benefits and costs of the framework, rather than looking at each part of the framework on a piecemeal basis. Often, the regulations and supervisory guidance issued by regulators has a "cumulative" or "compounding" effect on banks. A piecemeal approach ensures that banks cannot go to a single source or one regulation to understand supervisory expectations or requirements for a particular activity. While it may be possible to justify or explain any single regulation or piece of guidance on a standalone basis, when we consider the aggregate effects, it is clear that we need to rethink our approach and recommit to tailoring.</p>
<p>Regulatory ambivalence to tailoring comes at a significant cost. If current trends continue&mdash;where we push down requirements from large banks to small and attempt to "smooth" or standardize requirements and expectations across all banks&mdash;we will eventually find ourselves achieving the academically preferred end state of only a few large banks ineffectively serving the financial needs of the entire U.S. economy. In this state of the world, not only will community banks suffer but so will the communities they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Thank you again for the invitation to join you today. It is wonderful to see the ongoing success and commitment of the Robbins Banking Institute in preparing the next generation of leaders to play an important role in the banking and financial system. While I have expressed concern about some recent trends, one of the many benefits of our system is that there are always opportunities to change course, and I am confident that with committed and experienced leadership we can.</p>
<p>I am also confident that the future of community banking is bright, as long as we focus on right sized and appropriate regulations and guidance and a recognition that investment in innovation and growth is a necessity, not a roadblock. Regulators have an important opportunity now to prioritize changes that will support the safe and sound operation of community banks while allowing these banks to support the U.S. economy, serve their communities, innovate, and grow. Community banks enable the economic success of our country and will continue to support financial opportunities for many future generations. I look forward to seeing how the students in attendance here today will be a part of and shape that bright future.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pisces, which stands for "Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System," is the City of London's groundbreaking initiative to rejuvenate its stock market. Designed for flexibility, Pisces allows private companies to sell shares temporarily, bypassing the complexities and formalities of a traditional IPO on the London Stock Exchange</p>
<p><b>Commenting on PISCES presenting as a solution looking for a problem, Douglas Grant, Group CEO of Manx Financial Group,</b>&nbsp;said: <i>&ldquo;PISCES presents an intriguing attempt to enhance liquidity by offering an alternative to traditional stock exchanges. While any mechanism that helps entrepreneurs unlock equity is a welcome innovation, its practical appeal remains uncertain. Since PISCES only facilitates secondary trading without enabling capital raising, many companies may have little incentive to use it. Managing separate regimes for primary and secondary markets could also introduce unnecessary complexities. A critical factor in its success will be the alignment of tax incentives to encourage entrepreneur participation. Without a supportive framework, uptake may be limited. Moreover, existing platforms, such as AIM, may see PISCES as a competitive threat rather than a complementary tool, further constraining its market impact.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;That said, one of its most promising aspects is the potential to enhance liquidity by de-regulating fragmented local pension schemes, a strategy that has proven highly effective in other jurisdictions. If implemented effectively, this could drive market growth and create more robust capital dynamics. However, without clear advantages over existing alternatives, PISCES risks being a solution in search of a problem.&rdquo; </i></p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Analysis No. 48: Share Of Consumer Credit Debt Registered With Swedish Enforcement Authority Increases During Economic Downturns</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>In 2020, almost 130,000 individuals had a debt registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority that was related to consumer credit. Since the end of 2020, the general price level has increased (inflation) by almost 20 per cent. The Riksbank raised the policy rate during the same period, making it significantly more expensive to borrow money. In 2023, just over 160,000 individuals with consumer credit had new debts registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority, which represents an increase of 23 per cent since 2020. The new debts, measured in SEK, that were related to consumer credit were 51 per cent higher than they were in 2020.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Other debts registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority that were not related to consumer credit increased less. This shows that the share of consumer credit debt registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority increases during periods of increasing costs. The consumer credit debt measured in SEK increased more than the number of borrowers with new debts. This shows that high levels of consumer credit have made a significant contribution to the increase in debt registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority.</p>
<p>There are two primary explanations for why consumer credit accounts for a larger share of the debt registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority. First, consumer credit institutions issued more consumer credit in 2023 than they did in 2020. As a result, more borrowers had debts registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority since a large share of their customers experienced serious payment problems. Second, the share of borrowers that had debts registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority increased among customers of both the major and the niche banks. These banks often issue large loans. Even though they did not significantly increase their lending, more of their customers had debts registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority in 2023 compared to in 2020.</p>
<p>The share of customers that had a new debt registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority was still largest for consumer credit institutions, but the largest volumes in SEK of unpaid consumer credit debt registered with the Swedish Enforcement Authority is from the niche banks. Payment problems associated with consumer credit increased for borrowers of all ages except the youngest women. Payment problems increased the most for middle-aged borrowers.</p>

<title>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva’s Statement At The Conclusion Of The First Meeting Of The G20 Finance Ministers And Central Bank Governors</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/imf-managing-director-kristalina-georgievas-statement-at-the-conclusion-of-the-2025227/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva delivered the following remarks at the first meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in Cape Town, South Africa:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to thank the Government of South Africa for hosting this week&rsquo;s G20 meeting, and Minister Godongwana and Governor Kganyago for their leadership in shepherding a focused discussion on our shared global economic challenges.</p>
<p>There was one resounding common theme I heard during our discussions: the need to reinvigorate global growth in an environment characterized by limited macroeconomic policy space and heightened policy uncertainties. Against this backdrop, I see important opportunities to advance the reforms needed to deliver lasting global economic prosperity.</p>
<p><span>Global Outlook: Low Growth, High Debt</span></p>
<p>We project global growth at 3.3 percent this year and next&mdash;steady but well below historic average and in the context of high public debt levels. Underlying this, we see divergences widening across economies, with growth in the U.S. stronger and a somewhat more gradual pick up in the EU than previously expected. In emerging markets and developing economies, growth in 2025 broadly matches last year&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>The global disinflation process continues. With the gradual cooling of labor markets and energy prices expected to decline further, headline inflation is projected to continue its trajectory toward central bank targets.</p>
<p>At the same time, uncertainty with regard to economic policies is high. Governments around the world are shifting policy priorities. There are significant policy changes in the United States, in areas such as trade policy, taxation, public spending, immigration, and deregulation, with implications for the U.S. economy and the rest of the world. Governments in other countries are also adjusting their policies. The combined impacts of possible policy changes are complex and still difficult to assess but will come into clearer view in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Risks are also diverging. In the short-term, there is some upside potential in the U.S., where positive sentiment could boost activity. But, overall risks are to the downside for most other economies, including the risk of policy-induced disruptions to the disinflation process or capital outflows from emerging market economies.</p>
<p><span>Domestic Policies to Boost Growth</span></p>
<p>With the outlook for growth stuck at its lowest in decades, the central task is to craft policies that provide a strong foundation for higher and more durable growth.</p>
<p>Macroeconomic and financial stability must be preserved to enable growth. To that end, countries must manage multiple pressures: contain short-term risks, rebuild buffers, lift medium-term growth prospects.</p>
<p>For central banks, the focus remains fully restoring price stability, and to do so while supporting activity and employment.</p>
<p>On the fiscal side, most countries need to put public debt on sustainable path and rebuild fiscal buffers. While mobilizing more domestic revenues is crucial in many countries, it is equally important to promote more efficient public spending. The two go hand-in-hand to ensure that countries have the fiscal space to meet future shocks and provide the basis for higher future growth.</p>
<p>Critically, it is important that countries embrace ambitious reforms to lift productivity and enhance growth prospects. The specific priorities will vary from country to country, but in general this calls for a pivot toward supply side policies: cutting red tape, increasing competition and encouraging entrepreneurship, strengthening education systems, smart regulation that can encourage risk-taking and rapid but safe advances productivity-enhancing technology, such as AI.</p>
<p><span>Cooperative Actions to Boost Growth</span></p>
<p>While domestic reforms are essential, many countries cannot go it alone. Stepped up external support is vital to help countries implement reforms, through capacity development and concessional external support, and actions to crowd-in more private inflows.</p>
<p>There is also an urgent need to address debt challenges. A few countries may need to restructure their debt, while many more face high interest payments and refinancing needs that cripple their ability to invest in their future. A key step is to improve the predictability and timeliness of restructuring processes, building on the significant progress already achieved, including under the Common Framework. We also need to help countries with sustainable debt but faced with elevated interest payment and refinancing needs that crowd out their capacity to invest in education, health or infrastructure.</p>
<p>The IMF has a role to play. Through policy advice, capacity development, and lending where relevant, we help countries maintain or restore macroeconomic stability and implement sound policies needed for durable growth. We will continue to play a leading role on debt through our debt sustainability analyses and our support for international efforts to address debt challenges, including the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable.</p>
<p>We remain committed to helping our member countries achieve greater prosperity and stability.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Promoting Responsible Innovation Through The Novel Activities Program, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michael S. Barr, At Alliance For Innovative Regulation, Washington, D.C.</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/promoting-responsible-innovation-through-the-novel-activities-program-federal-r-2025227/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to the Alliance for Innovative Regulation for organizing this event and for bringing together banks, fintechs, and regulators to collaborate and foster responsible innovation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250227a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Innovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers, financial institutions, and the economy at large. Innovation can make financial products and services better, cheaper, and safer. It can make banking accessible to more consumers, advancing financial inclusion. It can modernize our financial infrastructures, creating efficiencies and providing new tools for banks to manage risk.</p>
<p>Innovation also comes with risks that need to be managed responsibly. Responsible innovation is in everyone's interest. Consumers want the benefits of innovation through products and services they can trust. Banks have an interest in managing the complexities of innovation responsibly, ensuring that they recognize new and evolving risks to safety and soundness, follow relevant laws, and protect and serve their customers. Fintechs often play a key role in offering products and services that allow banks to meet these needs. And regulators and supervisors should develop regulatory and supervisory frameworks that allow banks to clearly understand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities. To achieve that, regulators should provide ongoing transparency and clarity on our approach.</p>
<p>Today, I'd like to share how the Federal Reserve's Novel Activities Supervision Program, launched in the summer of 2023, plays an important role in supporting responsible innovation at our supervised institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250227a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Prior to this program, the Federal Reserve established temporary working groups and task forces to better understand evolving technologies to inform supervision. Ultimately, though, we determined we needed a dedicated supervisory function for novel activities. There were a number of factors driving that decision that guided how we designed the Program.</p>
<p>First, we understood that the pace of innovation was rapid. And we knew there would, of course, be benefits and risks stemming from innovation in the financial system. So we tasked the Novel Program with monitoring and understanding how these innovations and associated novel activities are used in banking and what benefits and risks they would pose. We gave them the mandate to keep up with the expertise related to use of new technologies and to employ new tools and data analytics in supervision. We invested time and research in understanding new technologies and businesses because we understood the importance of allowing innovation in the sector and avoiding excessively rigid stances on risk that don't take into account the potential to make advancements in the sector and economy that benefit all of society.</p>
<p>Second, we recognized that many financial institutions across the country are exploring and using many of the same technologies and similar novel business models. We felt it was important to create a coordinated approach to supervising novel activities across the Federal Reserve System. We initially identified two dozen firms, including firms of all sizes, for supervision by the Novel Activities Program. Firms are added or removed from the Program based on their engagement in novel activities. The supervisory program is designed to build a broad-based perspective of novel activities, the benefits and risks, and how those risks are managed. In this way, the Novel Program helps to enable similar supervision of similar risks, in a manner that reflects our current understanding of those activities in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>Third, while the technologies and products used by banks may be similar, their application and thus the benefits and risks may vary across business models. We understand the importance of tiering supervision to the type, extent, and level of risk posed by the novel activities and varied business models of supervised institutions and not imposing undue burden on firms. The Novel Activities Program employs a risk-based approach to supervision&mdash;meaning that the intensity of supervision is commensurate with the risk and scale of the activity. There is no one-size-fits-all model. Experts from the Novel team join the traditional supervisory teams that banks are used to working with on a regular basis, so there is no disruption or change in how we engage with banks. The Program is dynamic. As a bank changes its activities in this space, the rigor of the supervision similarly changes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250227a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>The Novel Activities Program serves as a central point of expertise on new and innovative activities, supporting coordinated and risk-based supervision, and facilitating collaboration and communication between supervisors and stakeholders, all of whom contribute to supporting responsible innovation.</p>
<p>Next, let me speak to two important principles in our Novel Program&mdash;clarity and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity</strong><br />Starting with clarity: for banks beginning to explore new technologies, supervisors should engage early in the process to understand the technology and the risks and provide a clear sense of their expectations along the way. Engagement allows for banks and their supervisors to share perspectives on effective risk management practices and the application of new technologies. Early and open dialogue creates opportunities for supervisors to provide feedback to banks on necessary risk management frameworks early on in their innovation process and to have an open dialogue that builds trust as products go to market.</p>
<p>As novel activities become more developed, we can issue guidance, resources, and other types of communications to further disseminate information, gather input, and provide clarity on effective risk management for novel activities. For example, in May 2024, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released a guide to assist community banks in developing and implementing third-party risk management practices, which could be a useful resource for banks seeking to engage in novel, technology-based partnerships.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250227a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;A few months later, the agencies issued a joint statement on arrangements with third parties to deliver bank deposit products and services, which discusses the risks these arrangements can present, offers examples of practices to manage those risks, and reminds banks of existing requirements and supervisory expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250227a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;There is no-one-size-fits-all approach in how we engage and communicate guidance to our firms, but it is essential that engagement happen to provide clarity to both sides.</p>
<p>I have said it before many times and want to reiterate it here: the Federal Reserve neither prohibits nor discourages banking organizations from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. It is up to banks to choose their own customers, and not supervisors. That has been and will continue to be our practice. In fact, banks supervised by the Federal Reserve provide material and important services to the crypto-industry. For example, banks supervised by the Fed operate real-time, 24/7 payment platforms that serve as a primary mechanism for companies to exchange dollars to settle crypto-asset transactions. We monitor that activity from both a safety and soundness and financial stability lens, but we do not tell banks to serve or not serve those customers.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong><br />Turning to collaboration, the private sector is at the forefront of innovation and that ongoing engagement and collaboration with industry gives supervisors insight into the evolving nature of novel innovations and developments. Insights gathered from supervision, analysis, and monitoring activities, and industry engagement, can identify real improvements to how financial services are delivered to households and businesses and how risks are managed by banks. Collaboration can also reveal areas where we can provide regulatory clarity for banks looking to engage in new activities.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize the importance of hearing from the public through tools like requests for information, or RFIs. The bank regulatory agencies published an interagency RFI on bank-fintech arrangements last July.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250227a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The purpose of the RFI was to build on the agencies' understanding of these arrangements by soliciting updated input on the nature of bank-fintech arrangements. This included effective risk management practices regarding those arrangements, and the implications of such arrangements for bank risk management, safety and soundness, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We were also interested in understanding whether enhancements to existing supervisory guidance would be considered helpful in addressing the risks associated with these types of arrangements. We received over 100 comments. Respondents shared their insights on many topics, including the risks and benefits of these arrangements and how the agencies can bring additional clarity to our supervisory expectations. Some in the banking sector commented that the Novel Activities Program is an example of how cross-team collaboration might deepen an agency's understanding of technology and innovation. The Federal Reserve and the other agencies are carefully considering the feedback we received as we consider how we can continue to support responsible innovation.</p>
<p>We will continue to invest time and resources learning more about innovative technologies such as distributed ledger technology and bank-fintech partnerships to understand how they may benefit the institutions we supervise and their customers. Moreover, interagency coordination and knowledge-sharing with federal and state regulators and the private sector continue to be critical sources of discussion, engagement, and knowledge-building.</p>
<p><strong>In Closing</strong><br />In closing, thank you for this opportunity to outline the Fed's Novel Activities Program, which I believe has already improved the clarity and consistency of our supervision related to innovative technologies and fostered collaboration as banks and supervisors seek to better understand the risks associated with these activities. I believe this approach will support innovation that benefits consumers while supporting safety and soundness. Thank you.</p>

FCCU chose DNA due to its modern, member-centric platform that enables greater efficiencies, open and simplified integration and robust commercial features.</p>
<p>FCCU, based in Chesterfield, Missouri, has $4.5bn in assets and 42 branch locations. Nearly half of these branches are within store locations of a large national retailer. With more than 400,000 members, FCCU celebrated its 90th anniversary serving its local communities in December 2024, and is a long-time Fiserv client spanning more than three decades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a high-touch credit union with a number of our branches uniquely located in the stores of a large national retailer. This is a significant differentiator for us among our members, but we take immense pride in blending in-person service with the digital experience,&rdquo; said Glenn Barks, President and CEO, FCCU. &ldquo;We picked DNA because it is a technologically sophisticated solution that will prime our organization for the future and keep us on the cutting edge of banking technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>DNA leads the way in awards and client satisfaction</span></p>
<p>The recent enhancements to DNA were recognized by research and advisory firm Celent at the 2024 xCelent Awards for community-based financial institution core systems, earning an xCelent Advanced Technology Award for its best-in-class technology architecture, with a high breadth of functionality complemented by significant customer base and support capabilities. In addition, DNA was designated a Luminary for technical capability. Celent noted that the diversity of the client base on DNA by institution type, size and geographic market are indicators of its technological superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiserv continues to invest heavily in its modern real-time DNA core system, with its scalable architecture, open integration, deployment flexibility and configurability making it a top solution for banks and credit unions,&rdquo; said Craig Focardi, principal analyst, Celent. &ldquo;Recent enhancements for public cloud deployment, commercial loan servicing, and open ecosystem integration will continue to appeal to financial institutions seeking to replace their current core systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to listening and acting to ensure our banking clients receive the solutions and support that they need, and that we meet and exceed their evolving expectations,&rdquo; said Dudley White, president, Core Account Processing Solutions, Fiserv. &ldquo;As we make continual investments in our core systems, we look forward to extending our partnership with First Community Credit Union to help them differentiate and enhance their offerings.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you, Hannah, for the invitation. I must confess to a degree of trepidation: I read your ABI Dinner speech, where you called for Alexander the Great&rsquo;s sword to be raised over regulators, and for bold strokes to be taken.</p>
<p>So I had to wonder for a moment, what fate may lay before me this morning, surrounded by 40 of your chief executive cavalry &ndash; a friendly breakfast or a last meal?</p>
<p>You were, in fact, making a very important point about, in your words, the &lsquo;Gordian knot of regulation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go further and talk about the Gordian knot of our growth challenge. And I agree with you, Hannah: tackling this urgent problem requires bold strokes &ndash; from all of us.</p>

<h2>Taking bold action</h2>
<p>At the FCA, we are willing to be bold. Last year, we made far-reaching changes to our listing rules. More fundamental change is coming on prospectuses. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/advice-guidance-boundary-review" title="Advice Guidance Boundary Review">Advice Guidance Boundary Review</a>&nbsp;aims to be transformative. But we need to be bold not just in&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;we do, but&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we do it.</p>
<p>Following my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf" title="fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf">letter to the Prime Minister</a>&nbsp;last month, we moved immediately to remove the expectation for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty-information-firms" title="Consumer Duty &ndash; information for firms">Consumer Duty Board champion</a>. From this morning, Boards can decide for themselves whether or not to have one.</p>
<p>And you may be surprised in the coming weeks at the pace we will move on the 50 or so growth proposals we made to the Prime Minister. On mortgage affordability, digital payments, removing redundant data returns, supporting international promotion of UK financial services, opening up to more innovative firms and cutting barriers between regulators.</p>
<p>And as we work with the Government on their financial and professional services strategy, one area where we have asked for bold thinking is around articulation of the Government&rsquo;s risk appetite &ndash; particularly in relation to consumer harm.</p>
<p>We would value metrics against which we can be held to account. And in turn, which can help give you the predictability and certainty you need. We hope you will engage in this debate too.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-building-trust-and-ensuring-stability">
<div class="container">
<h2>Building trust and ensuring stability</h2>
<p>But I know our ability to take these bold steps rests on a different, more trusting, approach between regulator and regulated. When I joined the FCA 4.5 years ago, the relationship between the FCA and the insurance industry was in a tough spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were not just in the midst of finalising a major but contentious intervention on general insurance pricing. We were also in court &ndash; ultimately the Supreme Court &ndash; on Covid business interruption insurance claims. Since then, I hope you will agree that we have built up that relationship, through pragmatic conversations about what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t. And I am glad that following last week&rsquo;s Court of Appeal judgement on treatment of furlough in business interruption claims, that stream of litigation is drawing to a close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing we all agree on is that major claims and redress events shake confidence &ndash; of consumers, investors, firms and those to whom we are accountable in Parliament. We are, of course, waiting for the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision on motor finance cases, but subject to their timetable, we hope we can provide clarity on any redress mechanism by the end of this year.</p>
<p>And for ongoing advice, where I know there had been concerns that this could become another major redress issue, our findings set out this week did not identify a systemic redress situation. So while we cannot rule out other major redress events in the event that systemic breaches of the law emerge, we are not currently anticipating any further such mass redress events.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>And our focus is now turning to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/calls-input/modernising-redress-system" title="Call for Input: Modernising the Redress System">joint Call for Input</a>&nbsp;(CfI) with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) on how complaints and redress mechanisms work. Reviewing the framework to ensure even tighter alignment, and clearer early warnings when significant issues are emerging. Boosting the predictability that firms need to make decisions.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-reducing-burdens-where-we-can">
<div class="container">
<h2>Reducing burdens where we can</h2>
<p>Alongside our first report on our secondary international competitiveness and growth objective, we published two papers of specific interest to the insurance market. The first on reforms to regulation of wholesale insurance markets, the second a Call for Input on how we could simplify our Handbook in light of the Consumer Duty. Thank you for the huge amount of engagement from you on this work. Let me say a few words about where we are on both.</p>
<p>On wholesale insurance, we heard concerns from commercial practitioners questioning the proportionality of applying some specific consumer protection rules to them. Our Discussion Paper that followed set out options to align conduct rules with FOS eligibility to ease the burden on firms insuring large SMEs, as well as considering flexibilities in product governance and bespoke contract exclusions. We&rsquo;ve had positive feedback from industry trade bodies on those and will consult on proposals soon.</p>
<p>Our proposals will go further than the Discussion Paper. We will also include ideas raised in response to the Consumer Duty CfI, such as the frequency of assessing fair value and removing prescription around continuous professional development. And talking about the CfI, we had 170 responses from firms of all sectors and sizes as well as consumer groups. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are working through this rich feedback. For the insurance sector specifically, we are looking hard at reporting requirements &ndash; disclosures, training and competency rules, review cycles, product-specific rules, and the scope of international rules. And where we can simplify, we will.</p>
<p>We have already taken on board concerns about the volume and complexity of firm-facing publications. We are launching our new single sign in portal &lsquo;My FCA&rsquo; next month and improving accessibility and efficiency of our Handbook with a machine-readable version. And we are looking to more quickly identify redundant data returns, consulting next month on the first batch that can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We also heard concerns around the pace of regulatory change, and are aiming for fewer large-scale changes in our next 5-year strategy. That said, I think the diversity of responses to the CfI &ndash; some think we are going too fast, some not fast enough &ndash; shows there is a debate to be had around the speed of change. And perhaps also where there is not agreement on the pace of change, whether we should still move quickly but with long transition periods. We are certainly willing to be creative and open to ideas on how we could be flexible.</p>
<p>We want to streamline our work. End duplication. So, for example, instead of taking forward new rules specifically on property funds, we&rsquo;ll focus on implementing International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and Financial Stability Board (FSB) guidelines on managing liquidity risk.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-commitment-to-consumer-resilience">
<div class="container">
<h2>Commitment to consumer resilience</h2>
<p>But I want to be clear: being serious about growth does not mean a diminishing focus on our primary objectives. The ability of consumers to access the right products for them &ndash; good quality, fair-value products &ndash; when they need to is central to our purpose. It will be an important part of our next 5-year strategy.</p>
<p>Insurance is a vital safety net for individuals and businesses alike, helping people manage risk and ride out challenges. And I&rsquo;m especially grateful to Hannah for her work as chair of the Financial Inclusion Taskforce, and to the firms working with us and Treasury, for helping to make sure that safety net is there for the most vulnerable. Unsurprisingly, insurance is the subject of a significant number of campaigns focused on the treatment and value people received. We are &ndash; and will continue to be &ndash; data-led. Scrupulous in assessing where we see significant harm, and when we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Since we brought in the Consumer Duty, we&rsquo;ve seen real improvements in product oversight and governance. But there&rsquo;s still work to do. We&rsquo;ve already intervened on Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance and vehicle valuations in motor insurance.</p>
<p>And we continue to focus on motor insurance pricing as part of the Government&rsquo;s broader motor insurance taskforce. The latest Association of British Insurers (ABI) data is encouraging &ndash; showing premiums have dropped for two consecutive quarters &ndash; but we won&rsquo;t be taking our eye off the ball.</p>
<p>We have announced a market study into premium finance, where we have concerns that charges may not be providing fair value for consumers &ndash; which is particularly worrying as the&nbsp;proportion of consumers using premium finance is increasing. And a study into pure protection, amid concerns that the design of commission arrangements may not be allowing firms to deliver good outcomes to policyholders.</p>
<p>Inevitably, those issues receive the headlines. The good practice we applaud less so. For example, the work of some firms to accept electronic notification of death, speeding up claims and making it easier for people finding their way, when vulnerable, through the complex and upsetting process of resolving a loved one&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-supporting-innovation">
<div class="container">
<h2>Supporting innovation</h2>
<p>And we are keen to support firms to innovate in ways that drive competition, improve efficiency and strengthen the UK as a leading centre for insurance. Take the possibilities of AI &ndash; portfolio optimisation, claims automation, fraud detection, even modelling natural disasters. The ABI's AI working group released a helpful guide on good use cases. And some of your firms took part in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab#section-ai-sprint">AI Sprint</a>, which generated more ideas.</p>
<p>And having supported nearly 1,000 firms through our innovation services over the past decade, the FCA is ready to support the safe experimentation on AI through our Sandboxes. I&rsquo;d encourage you to reach out to us.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So we are focused on maintaining strong consumer protections, on cutting unnecessary regulatory burdens, on supporting the growth mission. And we are moving at increasing pace. I've mentioned our new 5-year strategy, which we'll be saying more about next month.</p>
<p>Trust in the FCA and the financial services sector underpins the key themes running through that strategy: supporting consumers, supporting economic growth, tackling financial crime, and driving our own effectiveness. I&rsquo;m confident we can deepen trust through pragmatic conversations like the one we will have today.</p>
<p>And as well as drawing inspiration from Alexander the Great&rsquo;s sword to cut through the Gordian growth knot, I hope that we can also take a leaf from his playbook in assembling expertise. He didn&rsquo;t just rely on warriors; he surrounded himself with engineers, architects, scientists and historians. Drawing on a broad range of expertise in shaping cities, systems and democracies.</p>
<p>So, as we embark on our next 5-year strategy,&nbsp;I hope we can draw in the widest possible input and insight to enable a thriving sector that benefits both consumers&nbsp;and the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Market Data Pricing Inflation ‘Unsustainable’ As Cost Hikes Outpace Budgets, New Research Finds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>Average market data renewal increases across major index, ratings and terminals providers hit 15% in 2024, pushing overall consumer spend levels to increase by over 8%</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>But annual market data budgets have only seen a modest 2% growth in 2024</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>And some firms are paying 12 times more than peers for the same products from the same vendor</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>Substantive Research, the research and market data discovery and pricing analytics provider, has collaborated with Expand Research, a BCG Company that benchmarks firms' business, operations and technology performance, to publish a joint white paper entitled &ldquo;Market Data Pricing - 2024 in Review&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Released today, the white paper combines Expand&rsquo;s insights into consumers&rsquo; spend levels with Substantive Research&rsquo;s insights into vendor pricing inconsistency and discounting behaviour.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows the comprehensive capture and analysis of the key market dynamics and the assessment of how they manifest themselves at the provider and product levels.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Background</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>Major providers enjoy significant pricing power, and leverage their brands as marks of reliability and quality. Without public pricing information, in a world where supply contracts are negotiated in confidential isolation, firms grapple with rising costs in the dark, not knowing if their costs are proportionate, or in line with what peers are charged.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA recently investigated pricing in this market but in February 2024, the regulator&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Ffinancial-regulator-finds-wholesale-data-market-can-be-improved/1/01020195466b65fb-a7ebdda9-d156-4e30-9739-5710aaee37e3-000000/telVix8tC2tkevCs43qTbf8XVOg=415" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>ruled out</span></a><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><em><span>significant intervention because of potential unintended consequences</span></em><span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, financial institutions are facing enormous challenges from a market driven by provider power.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>White paper findings</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>The key finding of the research is that pricing inflation in the industry is unsustainable, with vendor cost increases far outpacing consumer budget and spend growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, large pricing disparities continue in the traditionally opaque market data market, across Indexes, Ratings, Terminals and ESG data - with some firms paying many multiples more than peers for the same products from the same vendors.</span></p>
<h4><span>The Substantive Research data showed that:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li> <span>The average renewal increases for major vendors have fluctuated over the past few years, with rates of 14% in 2022, 18% in 2023, and 15% in 2024.</span> </li>
<li> <span>In contrast, annual market data budgets have only seen modest growth, increasing by 3% in 2022, 2.11% in 2023, and 2.01% in 2024, with 3.1% projected for 2025.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Indexes: The largest pricing disparity discovered was 1,204%, meaning some firms are paying more than 12 times more than peers for the same products from the same providers - while&nbsp; y-o-y increases in price average at 25%.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Ratings: The largest pricing disparity uncovered by the study was 388%, meaning some firms are paying almost 4 times more than peers for the same products from the same vendors - while&nbsp; y-o-y increases in price average at 11%</span> </li>
<li> <span>Terminals: The study found that for identical products from the same vendors, some firms were paying over four times as much as their peers, with the largest price difference reaching 590%.</span> </li>
</ul>
<h4><span>The Expand Research data showed that:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li> <span>Overall Market Data Spend increased by 8.1% in the last year, the highest rate of increase in recent years.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Index and Ratings spend has increased substantially since 2019, both increasing by 9% in 2024.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Terminal spend was the key driver of the y-o-y increase, and increased by 7% in the last year.</span> </li>
<li> <span>ESG Data: Huge y-o-y increases of recent years are showing signs of slowing down, with a spend increase of 18% on average in 2024 versus 50%+ increases in previous years. 2024 also saw a reduction in the average number of vendors used for the first time.&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO at Substantive Research, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s remarkable how a small group of Index, Ratings, Terminal and ESG providers have become so integral to market infrastructure, and many would say that they are entitled to ensure they price robustly given their have-to-have status. But the opacity and inconsistency in pricing models means that market data consumers are flying blind with a top 3 cost line item, doing their best to mitigate year-on-year price increases, without any understanding of how their payments compare to the wider market.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The numbers are not adding up - Substantive Research&rsquo;s vendor pricing analysis and Expand&rsquo;s spend analysis shows that something will have to give. As it is, financial institutions are either having to deal with budget overspend, juggling costly inputs into other budget lines, or shrinking their provider list, just when they want to be making the most of the growth in value-add datasets to improve performance and processes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Jens Munthe, Principal at BCG Expand, said:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Market data spend continues to increase at levels well above inflation, with Terminals, Indexes and Ratings spend continuing to rise at near double digit percentages. Amongst the many drivers, Terminal spend has seen the highest increase, which rose 7% in 2024, more than double that of 2023.&nbsp; Our study, including Substantive Research&rsquo;s data, gives us the clearest picture yet of a troubling trend in the industry - where market data costs continue to accelerate well beyond market data budget growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;Financial institutions are facing cost pressures and margin compression throughout their organisations, so it is unsurprising that their C-suites are now focusing on the challenges of rising spend in market data. However this attention is exactly what the market data teams have been asking for - with buy-in from senior management, they can accelerate cost reduction and avoidance initiatives.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Damian McCarthy, CEO at BCG Expand, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;Expand&rsquo;s proprietary, industry-standard benchmarking data provides the most comprehensive view of market data spend available, trusted by leading financial institutions worldwide. By combining this with Substantive Research&rsquo;s unique insights into vendor pricing behaviors, together we are delivering an unparalleled, data-driven perspective on market data costs. This collaboration enables firms to make more informed decisions, ensuring they optimize their spending with full transparency and confidence in an area that has historically been opaque.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>HKEX 2024 Full Year Results</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bonnie Y Chan, Chief Executive Officer said: &ldquo;HKEX achieved significant strategic progress in 2024, with the implementation of key initiatives to enhance its market microstructure and listing franchise, announcements of multi-year platform development programmes to support the next generation of investors, expansion of our diverse product ecosystem, launch of new adjacent businesses, as well as expanded international engagement with investors and issuers. These ongoing efforts have reinforced Hong Kong&rsquo;s position as a leading international financial centre and, along with the more favourable investor sentiment from the third quarter that propelled trading volumes, as well as prudent cost management, helped HKEX report its highest-ever annual revenue and profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking to 2025, ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic developments will likely continue impacting global markets. However, there are also encouraging signs of economic revitalisation, with stimulative policies in Mainland China and interest rate cuts in other major markets providing renewed vibrancy to Hong Kong&rsquo;s fundraising and secondary markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a core infrastructure in Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets, and as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of our listing this year, we remain fully committed to investing in future-ready capabilities, enhancing the attractiveness and competitiveness of our markets, and ensuring their long-term vibrancy, resilience, and sustainability. We look forward to continue working with our stakeholders to lead the market and create the conditions for even greater success in the years to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Senate Economics Legislation Committee, 2024-2025 Additional Budget Estimates - Opening Statement By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The Senate Economics Legislation Committee, 2024-2025 Additional Budget Estimates, 27 February 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/senate-economics-legislation-committee-2024-2025-additional-budget-estimates-2025227/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/senate-economics-legislation-committee-2024-2025-additional-budget-estimates-2025227/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am pleased to appear before the Committee for the first time in 2025. I am joined today by Deputy Chair Sarah Court, and fellow Commissioners Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant, as well CEO Greg Yanco, Executive Director Enforcement and Compliance Chris Savundra and Executive Director Enterprise Services Peter Dunlop.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>New executive appointments</h2>
<p>As you will be aware, ASIC has appointed a new Chief Executive Officer Scott Gregson, who will take over from our retiring interim CEO Greg Yanco on the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of March. I&rsquo;d also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Yanco for his exemplary service, and his contribution to helping make ASIC a modern, confident and ambitious regulator.</p>
<p>This week we have also appointed Amy Nichol as ASIC&rsquo;s General Counsel. Peter Dunlop, who you will know has been with ASIC for three years as our Chief Financial Officer, has been appointed in the broader role of Executive Director Enterprise Services.</p>
<p>As this is our first estimates hearing for 2025, I thought it would be timely to provide a brief update on some key aspects of ASIC&rsquo;s work program for the coming year.</p>
<h2>Public and private markets</h2>
<p>Yesterday, we released a discussion paper canvassing key and emerging issues relating to public and private markets. The changing dynamics between public and private markets is evident worldwide. In Australia, the number of initial public offers is at a decade low, alongside declines in many developed markets. Australian and global private capital funds have experienced significant growth and are becoming an increasingly important source of economic funding, partly driven by the growth in domestic superannuation.</p>
<p>Our discussion paper poses questions to inform ASIC&rsquo;s priorities and future work program. The paper seeks feedback on ASIC&rsquo;s role in balancing the dual goals of ensuring Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets are open, accessible, attractive and support economic growth, while protecting against risks.</p>
<p>We are looking to ensure we have the regulatory settings right to maintain the integrity, transparency and efficiency of our capital markets, which is critical to the sound functioning of Australia&rsquo;s financial system and investor confidence.</p>
<h2>Simplification</h2>
<p>The ASIC Simplification Consultative Group (ASCG) held its first meeting this week to discuss how we can more efficiently and effectively administer the law.</p>
<p>As a regulator, our experience is that simplicity means enforceability. It&rsquo;s good for consumers, investors and businesses, and it is in line with government aims to reduce the regulatory burden throughout the economy. The ASCG&nbsp;will identify&nbsp;how we can more efficiently and effectively administer the law, how we can cut back on unnecessary bureaucracy and how we can simplify guidance and legislative instruments. The focus will be on making the most difference as quickly as possible&nbsp;for consumers and investors, for businesses and directors. I look forward to updating this committee on the progress of this group at a later date.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Our enforcement outcomes remain strong. Last year, we increased both our investigation numbers and civil litigation filings by more than 20% on the previous year, and we saw important enforcement outcomes across a broad range of areas, including greenwashing, crypto, predatory lending, high-cost credit and insider trading.</p>
<p>This year we have already seen a number of strong enforcement outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last Friday AustralianSuper was fined $27 million, with the Federal Court agreeing with the findings of our investigation which identified failure to merge multiple superannuation accounts.</li>
<li>In a strong signal to directors and executives on the importance of meeting their duties under the Corporations Act, this week the Federal Court penalised two former Star Entertainment executives for breaches of their Corporations Act duties, and disqualified them from managing corporations for a period of time. ASIC&rsquo;s proceedings continue in relation to the remaining nine former Star directors and officers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Recently we have also banned the former director of JB Markets from carrying on a financial services business after finding he was not a fit and proper person to participate in the financial services industry.</li>
<li>And, following an application made by ASIC, the Federal Court recently made interim freezing orders against certain assets of two individuals in connection with our investigation into the Shield Master Fund. These investigations are ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our 2025 enforcement priorities were launched in November 2024 and reflect our strong focus on investor and consumer protection in the face of increasing cost of living pressures. Our priorities are selected to focus our enforcement efforts on the areas of greatest potential financial harm and promoting transparent and reliable markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will detect, investigate and prosecute unlawful conduct that seeks to take advantage of consumers and investors.</li>
<li>We will target business models that avoid consumer credit protections.</li>
<li>We will target conduct that exploits superannuation savings, with a particular focus on fraudulent property investment schemes. We will continue to uphold the integrity of our financial markets, and to support this we have established a new dedicated team to target insider trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>We welcome the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On House Passage Of Budget Resolution</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-house-passage-of-budget-resolution-2025227/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today released the following statement from Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., SIFMA president and CEO, on passage of a budget resolution by the U.S. House of Representatives last evening:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA commends ongoing efforts in Congress to enact pro-growth tax reform and believes that passage of the House Budget Resolution is an important first step toward this goal shared by leaders in both chambers. SIFMA has long advocated for tax reforms that appropriately account for financial services&rsquo; foundational role in our economy and for a tax code that incentivizes and supports Americans to invest and save for retirement. Over 70% of all U.S. economic activity is funded by our capital markets through equity and debt financing, and a healthy and vibrant financial sector plays a direct role in supporting economic growth and providing capital for American companies. We look forward to continuing to work with both chambers of Congress to advance tax reforms that meet these goals.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Alan Burak, Founder Of Never Alone Capital, With Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-alan-burak-founder-of-never-alone-capital-with-fraud-2025226/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-alan-burak-founder-of-never-alone-capital-with-fraud-2025226/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Alan Burak, founder of Never Alone Capital LLC, with orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that raised approximately $4 million, most of which Burak misappropriated for personal expenses.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that, between 2018 and 2023, Burak engaged in a fraudulent scheme to recruit investors in his so-called investment fund, Never Alone Capital LLC, by falsely representing himself as a wealthy hedge fund owner, telling investors that Never Alone was an investment fund, and claiming that investor money would be invested in &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo; pursuant to a complex investment strategy, in some cases with a guaranteed return. Burak allegedly raised approximately $4 million from at least 17 investors, several of whom he met through a company that provides financial education programs in Spanish to the Latino community. However, as alleged in the complaint, Burak did not invest the money as he represented that he would. In fact, as alleged, Burak misappropriated the bulk of investor deposits, including to pay credit card charges for, among other things, luxury skin care and payments to an adult-only subscription service. Burak also allegedly sent investors false account statements that generally showed consistently positive returns, when in fact investors were consistently losing money. Burak eventually stopped responding to investors and, in an audio recording from July 2022, he stated, among other things, that he was fake, he did not have a real business, and he was stealing money from people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our complaint alleges, Burak convinced investors to trust him by lying about his investment expertise and strategies and then stole their money,&rdquo; said Samuel Waldon, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;We remain committed to identifying and holding accountable those who prey on innocent investors, and encourage those who suspect they are victims of fraud to report it to the SEC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Burak with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains together with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, as well as conduct-based injunctions.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the New York County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office today filed criminal charges against Burak.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, SIFMA published its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/insights/insights-fixed-income-market-structure-compendium/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fixed Income Market Structure Compendium</a>, offering a comprehensive examination of themes and market metrics shaping the U.S. fixed income markets throughout 2024. It also features a conversation with Coalition Greenwich on trends such as trading volumes, electronic trading, and market liquidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2024, U.S. fixed income markets were shaped by high levels of Treasury issuance, record levels of federal debt, and evolving Treasury clearing dynamics,&rdquo; said Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., SIFMA&rsquo;s president and CEO. &ldquo;SIFMA&rsquo;s Fixed Income Market Structure Compendium offers a comprehensive analysis of these issues, supported by market metrics on issuance and trading volumes. It offers valuable insights that reinforce the importance of ensuring that America&rsquo;s capital markets are effective and resilient.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Treasury Clearing</span>:</span>&nbsp;The first deadline for the Treasury and repo clearing mandate is September 2025 after the SEC extended the implementation timeline. These markets consist of $27.8 trillion in Treasury securities outstanding and $4.4 trillion in repo average daily amount outstanding. Unlike with the transition to T+1 settlement, market participants are not expecting a big bang with Treasury clearing, rather a phase in of activity. Treasury clearing volumes could rise by over $4 trillion a day, bringing the aggregate volume to $11.5 trillion daily, a 53.3% increase to today&rsquo;s volume of $7.5 trillion.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Treasury Issuance</span>:</span>&nbsp;In 2024, the U.S. government issued $2.4 trillion in privately held net marketable securities per annum, 144.9% greater than the historical average. This represented another elevated issuance level in a non-recession, non-war, and non-emergency year.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Issuance Skewed to Shorter Durations</span>:</span>&nbsp;The continuation of elevated levels of fiscal spending mean the Treasury Department must keep issuing debt &ndash; and issue they have &ndash; in 2024, total issuance was $29.3 trillion, driven by bills, +404%, while notes grew 116% and bonds grew 161%.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Federal Debt</span>:</span>&nbsp;High levels of fiscal spending flowed through to the balance sheet &ndash; as of the end of 2024, the level of federal debt had grown to $28.3 trillion, a 7.6% year over year increase and 68.1% increase since the pre COVID average. Additionally, the federal deficit stands at $1.8 trillion, the second-highest recorded, or 6.3% as a percent of GDP, greater than the Great Depression and stock market crash, Black Monday, and the dotcom bubble burst.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Treasury Holders Landscape</span>:</span>&nbsp;At the same time as the balance sheet grew, the composition of Treasury holders has shifted. At the end of 2024, the Fed held 16.5%, foreign holders held $33.0%, and other holders represented 50.1%. Other holders posted the largest increases both over the last 10 years (113.4%) and to the pre COVID average (69.1%).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Key Metrics</span>:</span>&nbsp;The Compendium also highlights 2024 key metrics for fixed income markets issuance, trading average daily volume, and outstanding across the total market, U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, federal agency securities, municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities. Treasuries dominated the fixed income landscape in 2024, with long-term issuance up 33% year-over-year, total outstanding exceeding $28 trillion, and average daily volume (ADV) surpassing $900 billion.</li>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Welcome Extension On US Treasury Clearing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-welcome-extension-on-us-treasury-clearing-2025226/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-welcome-extension-on-us-treasury-clearing-2025226/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yesterday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-43">announced it would delay the implementation of mandatory clearing for US Treasury securities by one year</a>. That means eligible cash transactions will now need to be cleared by December 31, 2026, with repos following from June 30, 2027. This is a very welcome extension that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/01/22/deadline-pressure-on-treasury-clearing/">ISDA and other industry groups had been advocating for</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;d like to thank the SEC for taking this crucial step. But it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that this is the absolute minimum extension that is necessary &ndash; several critical operational, regulatory and legal issues need to be resolved, and this will take time.</p>
<p>In granting the extension, the SEC recognized that the US Treasury market is a critical component of the global financial system. With outstanding issuance of nearly $30 trillion, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s most systemically important market, and its deep liquidity and resilience attracts investors around the world. It underpins the secured dollar funding market globally and serves as collateral for a significant volume of derivatives transactions.</p>
<p>The need for an extension was never about avoiding these reforms, but rather about making sure there is sufficient time to complete the necessary preparations in a way that protects the integrity of this vital market. We know from our experience in derivatives clearing and margining of non-cleared derivatives that these things take time, particularly given the global reach of the rules. There are no short cuts.</p>
<p>In fact, significant progress has been made to prepare for clearing. The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) has published proposed changes to its rule book, while CME Group has published proposals for a new clearing service. ICE has also announced it will launch a Treasury clearing service. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association is leading an industry group to develop appropriate client documentation and is making good progress, but this documentation needs to reflect the various clearing models and rule books that are still being developed.</p>
<p>Once finalized, dealers will then need to execute the new documents with thousands of counterparties, as well as obtain netting opinions to ensure efficient capital treatment. This will be a huge amount of work that was at risk of being rushed within the original time frame.</p>
<p>The additional time also provides an opportunity for policymakers to address important regulatory and capital issues that could hinder the efficient implementation of Treasury clearing. For example, FICC and CME Group offer cross-margining at the clearing-member level to enable initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of cash, repo and futures transactions. These firms have announced their intention to extend cross-margining to client transactions, subject to approval by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &nbsp;But there is no recognition in the proposed US capital framework for corresponding cross-product netting across derivatives and repo trades. Unless this is resolved, it will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer US Treasury clearing to their clients.</p>
<p>Another issue that needs to be addressed is the US supplementary leverage ratio, which acts as a non-risk-sensitive binding constraint on banks that can impede their ability to act as intermediaries, including their capacity to offer client clearing.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/cpi-report-today-inflation-stock-market-02-12-2025/card/powell-says-easing-bank-capital-requirements-could-help-treasury-market-s2FgvVH2xlHnNChGEb3o">Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell recently acknowledged</a>&nbsp;in testimony to the House Committee on Financial Services that changes are necessary, so we would urge prudential regulators to start working on proposals without delay.</p>
<p>Adjustments are also needed to the Basel III endgame rules and the surcharge for global systemically important banks to avoid punitive and unnecessary increases in capital for client clearing businesses.</p>
<p>We now have 22 months until the first clearing mandate will be introduced. This will be a transformational change to a systemically important market, so we thank the SEC for taking this step and granting the additional time. Now the hard work must continue. Issues like cross-product netting and the SLR must be addressed in quick order to give clearing the best chance of success and to maintain the depth and liquidity of the US Treasury market. Given its importance, we must do this right.</p>

<title>Between A Shock And A Hard Place: Trade Fragmentation And Monetary Policy – Speech By Swati Dhingra, Bank Of England, Member Of The Monetary Policy Committee, Given At The 2025 Dow Lecture, National Institute Of Economic And Social Research</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We live in an era of deep economic integration, where goods and services cross borders at an unprecedented scale. However, in recent years, the political consensus around globalisation has started to fracture. In this lecture, I will discuss how our trading relationships have shaped price stability and the potential impacts of trade fragmentation on the UK economy. The appropriate monetary policy response to new developments would depend on the nature of fragmentation, its sectoral impacts, and the time horizon over which it would be expected to unwind.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I am delighted to deliver the Dow lecture. Last time I was here at NIESR, there were significant events occurring in international trade. Today, I am going to revisit some of them and discuss the new developments that have taken place since then. The timing is opportune - not just because of how the world trading system is evolving around us.</p>

<title>A Clean Industrial Deal For Competitiveness And Decarbonisation In The EU</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-clean-industrial-deal-for-competitiveness-and-decarbonisation-in-the-eu-2025226/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-clean-industrial-deal-for-competitiveness-and-decarbonisation-in-the-eu-2025226/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission presents the&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/9db1c5c8-9e82-467b-ab6a-905feeb4b6b0_en">Clean Industrial Deal</a>, a bold business plan to support the competitiveness and resilience of our industry. The Deal will accelerate decarbonisation, while securing the future of manufacturing in Europe.</p>
<p>Faced with high energy costs and fierce and often unfair global competition, our industries need urgent support. This Deal positions decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth for European industries. This framework can drive competitiveness as it gives certainty and predictability to companies and investors that Europe remains committed to become a decarbonised economy by 2050.</p>
<p>President Ursula&nbsp;<span>von der Leyen</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;<em>Europe is not only a continent of industrial innovation, but also a continent of industrial production. However, the demand for clean products has slowed down, and some investments have moved to other regions. We know that too many obstacles still stand in the way of our European companies from high energy prices to excessive regulatory burden. The Clean Industrial Deal is to cut the ties that still hold our companies back and make a clear business case for Europe.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission is also taking&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_614">actions</a>&nbsp;to make our regulatory environment more efficient while reducing bureaucratic hurdles for businesses. Today's measures are the results &nbsp;of the active engagement with industry leaders, social partners and civil society in the context of the Antwerp Declaration for a European&nbsp;<a href="https://antwerp-declaration.eu/">Industrial</a>&nbsp;Deal and the European Commission's&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1884">Clean Transition Dialogues</a>.</p>
<p><span>A business plan to decarbonise, reindustrialise and innovate</span></p>
<p>The Deal focuses mainly on two closely linked sectors: energy-intensive industries and clean tech.</p>
<p>i)&nbsp;<span>Energy-intensive industries</span>&nbsp;as they require urgent support to decarbonise and electrify. The sector faces high energy costs, unfair global competition and complex regulations, harming its competitiveness. ii)&nbsp;<span>Clean Tech</span>&nbsp;is at the heart of future competitiveness and growth as well as crucial for industrial transformation.&nbsp;<span>Circularity&nbsp;</span>is also a central element of the Deal, as we need to maximise EU's limited resources and reduce overdependencies on third country suppliers for raw materials. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Deal presents measures strengthening the entire value chain. It serves as a framework to tailor action in specific sectors. The Commission will present an Action Plan for the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_378">automotive industry</a>&nbsp;in March and an Action Plan on&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_611">steel and metals</a>&nbsp;in Spring. Other tailored actions are planned for the chemical and clean tech industry.</p>
<p>Today's Communication identifies&nbsp;<span>business drivers</span>&nbsp;for industry to succeed in the EU:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Lower energy costs</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Affordable energy is the foundation of competitiveness. The Commission therefore adopted today an&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_570"><span>Action Plan on Affordable Energy</span></a>&nbsp;to lower energy bills for industries, businesses and households. The Act will speed up the roll-out of clean energy, accelerate electrification, complete our internal energy market with physical interconnections, and use energy more efficiently and cut dependence on imported fossil fuels. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Boosting demand for clean products</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act&nbsp;</span>will increase demand for EU-made clean products, by<span>&nbsp;</span>introducing&nbsp;<span>sustainability</span>,&nbsp;<span>resilience, and made in Europe criteria&nbsp;</span>in public and private procurements<span>.</span>&nbsp;With the review of the Public Procurement Framework in 2026, the Commission will introduce sustainability, resilience and&nbsp;<span>European preference criteria</span>&nbsp;in public procurement for strategic sectors.</p>
<p>The Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act will also launch&nbsp;<span>a voluntary carbon intensity label</span>&nbsp;for industrial products, starting with steel in 2025, followed by cement. The Commission will&nbsp;<span>simplify and harmonise carbon accounting methodologies.</span>&nbsp;These labels will inform consumers and allow manufacturers to reap a premium on their decarbonisation efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Financing the Clean Transition</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the short-term, the Clean Industrial Deal will mobilise<span>&nbsp;</span>over<span>&nbsp;&euro;100 billion&nbsp;</span>to support EU-made clean manufacturing. This amount includes an additional&nbsp;<span>&euro;1 billion</span>&nbsp;guarantees under the current Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
<p>The Commission will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a new&nbsp;<span>Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework.&nbsp;</span>It will allow for simplified and quicker approval of State aid measures for the roll-out of renewable energy, deploy industrial decarbonisation and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity of clean tech.</li>
<li>Strengthen the&nbsp;<span>Innovation Fund</span>&nbsp;and propose an&nbsp;<span>Industrial Decarbonisation Bank</span>, aiming for&nbsp;<span>&euro;100 billion</span>&nbsp;in funding, based on available funds in the Innovation Fund, additional revenues resulting from parts of the ETS as well as the revision of InvestEU.</li>
<li>Amend the&nbsp;<span>InvestEU&nbsp;</span>Regulation to&nbsp;<span>increase InvestEU's risk bearing capacity</span>. This will mobilise up to&nbsp;<span>&euro;50 billion&nbsp;</span>in additional private and public investment, including in clean tech, clean mobility and waste reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Investment Bank</span>&nbsp;(EIB) Group will also launch a series of concrete new financing instruments to support the Clean Industrial Deal. The EIB will launch: i) a &lsquo;Grids manufacturing package' to provide counter-guarantees and other de-risking support to manufacturers of grid components; ii) a joint European Commission-EIB pilot programme of counter-guarantees for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) undertaken by SMEs and energy intensive industries; and iii) launch a CleanTech guarantee Facility under the Tech EU programme powered by InvestEU.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Circularity and access to materials</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Critical raw materials are key for our industry. The EU therefore has to secure access to such materials and reduce exposure to unreliable suppliers. At the same time, placing circularity at the core of our decarbonisation strategy helps maximising the EU's limited resources. The Commission will therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a&nbsp;<span>mechanism enabling European companies to come together and aggregate their demand</span>&nbsp;for critical raw materials.</li>
<li>Create an&nbsp;<span>EU Critical Raw Material Centre</span>&nbsp;to jointly purchase raw materials on behalf of interested companies. Joint purchases create economies of scale and offer more leverage to negotiate better prices and conditions.</li>
<li>Adopt a&nbsp;<span>Circular Economy Act</span>&nbsp;in 2026 to accelerate the circular transition and ensure that scarce materials are used and reused efficiently, reduce our global dependencies and create high quality jobs. The aim is to have 24% of materials circular by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Acting on a global scale</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The EU needs reliable global partners more than ever. In addition to ongoing and new trade agreements, the Commission will soon launch the first&nbsp;<span>Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships,</span>&nbsp;which will diversify supply chains and forge mutually beneficial deals. At the same time, the Commission will act even more decisively to protect our industries from unfair global competition and overcapacities through a range of Trade Defence and other instruments. The Commission will also simplify and strengthen the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_614"><span>CBAM</span></a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ensuring access to a skilled workforce</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The transformation of our industry requires skilled people and top talents. The Commission will establish a&nbsp;<span>Union of Skills&nbsp;</span>that invests in workers, develops skills and creates quality jobs. With Up to &euro;90<span>&nbsp;</span>million from Erasmus+, the Deal will help reinforce sectoral skills for strategic industries linked to the Clean Industrial Deal. The Deal also supports quality jobs, promote social conditionalities and provide further support to workers in transitions.</p>
<p><span>Background</span></p>
<p>In her&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en">political guidelines</a>&nbsp;(2024-2029), President von der Leyen announced to deliver the Clean Industrial Deal within the first 100 days of the Commission's mandate as a priority to ensure competitiveness and prosperity in the EU.</p>
<p>The Clean Industrial Deal builds further on the active engagement from industry leaders, social partners and civil society in the context of the Antwerp Declaration for a European&nbsp;<a href="https://antwerp-declaration.eu/">Industrial</a>&nbsp;Deal and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1884">Clean Transition Dialogues</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>With the fulfillment of her term, and the nomination of Brian Quintenz to succeed her, Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero will step down from the Commission upon Mr. Quintenz&rsquo;s confirmation, and retire from federal service. &nbsp;Commissioner Goldsmith Romero said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a tremendous privilege to serve in the federal government for 23 years. &nbsp;Following my wonderful tenure at the SEC and as the Special Inspector General for TARP at the Department of the Treasury, it has been a joy to be a CFTC Commissioner and serve alongside my fellow Commissioners and the CFTC staff. &nbsp;History has shown how sound regulation plays a critical role in U.S. financial markets being the envy of the world, and I am honored to have played a part in promoting U.S. markets and protecting investors and customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;I congratulate my friend and fellow Commissioner, Christy Goldsmith Romero, on her retirement from decades of dedicated federal service&rdquo; said Acting Chairman Caroline Pham. &ldquo;Throughout her distinguished career, she has worked tirelessly to protect the American public and address risks in banking and financial services.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, the Division of Enforcement released an Enforcement Advisory on Self-Reporting, Cooperation and Remediation (Advisory). I thank the Division staff for receiving and considering the comments shared by my office. While I am supportive of the goals of greater transparency, clarity, and efficiency in enforcement practices designed and developed to enhance registrants&rsquo; willingness to be forthcoming and cooperative with the Commission, I believe that we must be careful not to muddy the waters. To best enable market participants to develop internal compliance infrastructure, is critical that the Commission offer clear, consistent guidance that enables effective compliance as well as a well-defined pathway to report, cooperate, or remediate. We must exercise caution when advancing new reporting, cooperation, and remediation regimes or rescinding long-standing guidance. &nbsp;Any effort to adopt new reporting processes, particularly processes that require inter-division guidelines and infrastructure, must be consistent with the mandates of our statue and regulation. Consequently, I am unable to support the Division&rsquo;s recent Advisory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In developing the Advisory, the Division may have benefited from deeper engagement with other divisions at the Commission, market participants, and the Commissioners and their staff. I stand ready to work with all of the divisions at the Commission and our registered market participants to develop further clarity on the Commission&rsquo;s policies articulated in the Advisory.</span></p>

<title>Europex: Efficient And Liquid Energy Markets Are Key To Achieving The Clean Industrial Deal Objectives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Europex welcomes today&rsquo;s presentation of the Clean Industrial Deal (CID) by the European Commission, an overarching growth strategy that strategically combines the strengthening of EU industrial competitiveness with the acceleration of decarbonisation towards the 2030 and 2050 climate targets. As Europe commits to revitalising its industries while upholding its climate ambitions, wellfunctioning, eLicient and liquid energy markets are essential for delivering aLordable energy to both European industries and households.</p>
<p>To this end, we support the strategic objective of further strengthening the EU Internal Energy Market (IEM), as outlined in the Action Plan for ALordable Energy, presented today as a key pillar of the CID. To achieve a fully integrated energy market the focus should be on increasing investments in interconnectors, enhancing energy system flexibility through market-based solutions, streamlining network tariLs and lowering energy taxation where feasible. In addition, the EU must prioritise the consistent implementation of existing legislation across all Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, long-term contracts, such as Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) constitute a valuable tool in accelerating the development of renewable energy. However, the implementation of these contracts, alongside Contracts for DiLerence (CfDs), should be carefully assessed in relation to existing long-term hedging instruments as well as potential negative spill-over eLects on spot markets. These instruments already support the growth of renewable energy projects while providing cost-eLicient price management solutions to increase their bankability.</p>
<p>On the contrary, we believe that the EU should carefully evaluate any new market overhauls &ndash; whether in energy or financial services legislation &ndash; and avoid fragmenting the IEM through regional or national market interventions aimed at temporarily decoupling gas and electricity prices. As demonstrated during the energy crisis, such interventions disrupt the price signals essential for eLicient dispatch and investment decisions as well as energy eLiciency measures.</p>
<p>When it comes to gas wholesale markets, Europex generally considers the existing regulatory framework for energy and financial markets to be fit for purpose, ensuring optimal market functioning. Energy derivatives markets play a crucial role in providing stability instruments that enable the eLicient management of price risks in volatile energy markets while supporting investments in energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Finally, in support of the Action Plan&rsquo;s main objective to deepen the integration of the IEM, we emphasise the importance of active stakeholder engagement. Europex therefore calls on the European Commission to allow market stakeholders to engage in the Gas Market Task Force, as is also facilitated in the proposed Energy Union Task Force. In both task forces, the expertise and insights of energy exchanges and other market stakeholders are essential to ensuring that the right actions and adjustments are identified and implemented eLectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>The UK non-bank finance sector manages approximately &pound;14.3 trillion in assets and continues to grow. Its use of leverage can help boost returns, enhance efficiency, and manage risks.

<li>We believe that targeted improvements to public and private disclosure could go a long way in mitigating the build-up of systemic risk from non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) leverage.</li>
<li>Regulators need to have the necessary data, systems and tools in place to effectively monitor NBFI leverage use and identify systemic risk.</li>
<li>We are playing a leading role in this area, and co-chairing a working group to support the ongoing Financial Stability Board (FSB) consultation on a suite of proposals on monitoring and addressing systemic risk arising from NBFI leverage.</li>

<h2>Cultivating well-functioning markets</h2>
<p>At this time of year, it&rsquo;s almost impossible not to think about spring. Warmer weather, a bit of sun. It&rsquo;s always a joy to see the world come back to life after a dull, grey winter. It might be a clich&eacute; comparison, but I find that the world of financial markets is not dissimilar to a garden. Certainly, as a regulator, we think about markets as a gardener might think about their plants &ndash; we want them to grow and thrive, we want them to be able to manage changing or uncertain weather conditions, and we want to see plants return year after year.</p>
<p>In many ways, I think this is a helpful way to frame our thinking about leverage. In the same way that a garden needs water and nutrients to flourish, leverage underpins a great deal of essential activity in financial markets. As the gardeners amongst you will know, though, measurement is key &ndash; too much water or the wrong balance of nutrients have the opposite effect. And the amount of water or nutrients required at any time needs to be calibrated according to weather predictions and seasonal conditions.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, financial regulators globally have been acutely aware of this need for balance &ndash; focusing on ensuring that NBFI entities have access to leverage in the ways, means, and quantities that allow the markets to prosper. And with sufficient mechanisms in place to monitor and measure it.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-an-overview-of-leverage">
<div class="container">
<h2>An overview of leverage</h2>
<p>The NBFI sector &ndash; by which I mean the diverse ecosystem of activities, entities, and infrastructures that sit outside the traditional regulatory framework for banks &ndash; is an increasingly essential aspect of the UK economy.</p>
<p>Like other parts of the financial system, it provides a range of services to the UK market, managing approximately &pound;14.3 trillion of client assets, including circa &pound;2.9 trillion of UK pension assets, and operating one of the largest global hubs for insurance, with annual premiums written of &pound;326 billion across life and general insurance. The services provided by this large and growing sector bring significant benefits to the UK economy.</p>
<p>Today, I want to focus on one specific feature of NBFI, and that is its use of leverage.</p>
<p>Up front, I want to acknowledge that leverage is, of course, not inherently a cause for concern. The NBFI sector&rsquo;s use of leverage is an essential component of the deep and efficient capital markets we have in the UK. Leverage helps NBFI entities hedge their risks, it funds productive investment, helps achieve target returns for investors, and provides liquidity to the system. Leverage underpins well-functioning markets.</p>
<p>However, the presence of leverage can create vulnerabilities, especially when it&rsquo;s poorly managed, there&rsquo;s a lack of transparency, or it is concentrated. In those cases, when a shock occurs, what normally brings benefits to the economy can suddenly become an amplifier of instability and a cause for loss of confidence. For regulators, that&rsquo;s a real concern &ndash; we know that market stability is a prerequisite for an efficient economy and sustainable growth.</p>
<p>But when do we need to worry that NBFI leverage is becoming a threat to financial stability? How do we tell when leverage use crosses the line from investment risk, a normal and healthy aspect of financial markets, into systemic risk &ndash; a risk to the system itself? This is a crucial question, and one we must answer to know when and where leverage usage constitutes a risk to be addressed.</p>
<p>We can be informed by a few recent episodes of market volatility when NBFI leverage use contributed to market disruption and amplified instability. From those, we can identify a few common characteristics.</p>
<p>The first is the presence of NBFI leverage in what we call &lsquo;core markets&rsquo;: those markets which are essential to the functioning of the financial system and ultimately the real economy, such as government bond markets. We saw this during the dash for cash in March 2020, when a number of hedge funds were forced to unwind highly leveraged relative value positions in U.S. Treasury markets, amplifying selling pressure and contributing to the dislocation that led the Federal Reserve to intervene.</p>
<p>We saw this again in the autumn of 2022, when fiscal policy announcements led to a surge in long-dated yields and unexpectedly large margin calls on repo borrowings and interest rate derivatives for UK pension funds&rsquo; investments in liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies. As a result, LDI investors needed to liquidate gilts to de-lever. This created a further cycle of falling prices and increasing margin calls, until the Bank of England intervened to restore market functioning. In both cases, the presence of significant NBFI leverage in core markets contributed to market disruption and exacerbated financial instability.</p>
<p>The second characteristic is interconnectedness between leveraged NBFI entities and the banking sector or systemically important institutions. Most NBFI entities are not systemically important and can and should be able to fail if they take on too much investment risk through leverage. However, when a leveraged NBFI is heavily interlinked with the banking sector and fails, this can become a systemic risk if it threatens the stability of that systemic institution.</p>
<p>We were reminded of this possible threat by the collapse of family office Archegos in March 2021 which led to large losses for many of its bank counterparties. The interlinkage between certain non-banks and a systemically important clearinghouse also played a key role in the nickel crisis of 2022.</p>
<p>Finally, recent market crises show that leveraged exposures that are concentrated or crowded might merit additional attention. This factor is also currently a difficult risk to spot and respond to. Archegos obtained significant synthetic leverage from numerous bank counterparties to build large, concentrated positions in a small number of relatively illiquid equities. When one of its largest holdings experienced a material adverse price shock, Archegos failed to make its margin calls and defaulted within days. Many of its bank counterparties had failed to identify the full extent of its concentrated exposures, leaving several of them with significant losses when the cost of liquidating their exposures far exceeded the margins they held.</p>
<p>Likewise, in autumn of 2022, the large number of pension funds pursuing similar LDI strategies led them to 'crowd' into similar positions in long-dated inflation-linked gilts, so that when gilt yields (and margin calls) suddenly spiked, they moved in unison to liquidate those gilts, leaving few natural buyers and amplifying the downward pressure on gilt prices.</p>
<p>So, past evidence and experience highlights several key factors that might merit particular attention. The presence of NBFI leverage in core markets, leverage use by NBFIs interconnected with systemically important institutions, and NBFI leverage which is highly concentrated or crowded can generate not only investment risk but can produce outcomes that amplify market instability and start to look a lot closer to systemic risk.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-our-approach">
<div class="container">
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>These recent market stresses teach us that market participants, counterparties, and authorities all have a role to play in spotting and managing risk from NBFI leverage use.</p>
<p>We at the FCA believe that the first line of defence against the build-up of systemic risk related to leverage use is NBFIs themselves appropriately managing their own investment risk. When individual market participants manage their investment risks effectively, this can reduce the build-up of risks within the system as a whole.&nbsp; However, for NBFIs to effectively manage their risks related to leverage use, they need to have access to adequate data and information about the markets in which they operate and the risks to which they're exposed.</p>
<p>For this reason, we support regulatory initiatives that enhance the availability of that information.</p>
<p>Information which can help NBFIs manage their own risk includes information available through public disclosure &ndash; in the form of anonymous, aggregated information on concentrated positioning and liquidity conditions which allows market participants to better understand market dynamics and identify emerging risks. This kind of information can feed into NBFIs&rsquo; calculation of liquidation costs, help them identify crowded trading strategies, and then adjust their leverage use accordingly. For example, commitment of trader reports published by futures exchanges give helpful knowledge of dynamics in commodity derivatives markets. We believe this style of disclosure could be useful in other areas.</p>
<p>If NBFIs&rsquo; risk management is the first line of defence, then the second is counterparty credit risk management. When NBFIs fail to manage their risk sufficiently, their leverage providers' counterparty risk management should act as a second check. However, in recent stress episodes, we've seen that counterparty credit risk management has often failed to prevent systemic risks from crystallising. Again, this is in part because the right people don't necessarily have the right information &ndash; leverage providers haven&rsquo;t always had sufficient transparency on the risks they face.</p>
<p>Enhancing private disclosure between counterparties would give those leverage providers more information about the overall risk exposures of their NBFI clients, allowing them to manage their counterparty risk more effectively. This should, in turn, indirectly reduce the build-up of unknown concentrated or crowded NBFI leverage use &ndash; as with greater consistency of data, leverage providers would be more easily able to spot concentration or crowdedness and could then make their own decisions on how much leverage to extend or how to price it in those circumstances.</p>
<p>That said, if NBFIs are required to disclose too much information, this could reveal proprietary information about their investment strategies.</p>
<p>The complexity of balancing improvement in counterparty risk management with the need for client confidentiality makes this an area where we believe regulators would benefit from continuing close dialogue with industry. Rather than authorities unilaterally mandating requirements, we think industry has an important role to play in establishing best practice and in developing solutions that can balance the interests of leverage users and providers to improve data availability so that NBFIs and counterparty credit providers can continue to operate as the 1st and 2nd lines of defence.</p>
<p>Relatedly, transparency to market operators can also be helpful. Operators of listed derivatives trading venues may need information on related over-the-counter (OTC) exposures to ensure they can identify potential concentration risk and maintain market integrity. For these reasons, we have recently issued a policy statement on the commodity derivatives regulatory framework which sets out trading venue surveillance requirements and aims to enhance private disclosure of OTC positions to trading venues so they can identify risks early on.</p>
<p>In short: we believe that targeted improvements to public and private disclosure could go a long way in mitigating the build-up of systemic risk from NBFI leverage.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re also realistic. We know there will be instances where increased transparency for market participants cannot on its own prevent the build-up of systemic risk from NBFI leverage. There will be firms that still fail to manage their risks well, and there will be risks, including many of those which are more systemic in nature, which firms simply don&rsquo;t have the ability to spot because they don&rsquo;t have a system-wide view. For example, prime brokers will only know about their own clients' exposures, so they may be unable to identify concentration or crowdedness risks building up across the market. Similarly, market participants may be able to identify possible concentration or crowdedness from public disclosure, but its aggregate nature means they will not be able to spot everything.&nbsp; This is where the regulator comes in: as the third line of defence.</p>
<p>Regulators need to have the necessary data, systems and tools in place to effectively monitor NBFI leverage use from a systemic perspective to uncover the risks to financial stability that market participants miss.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-focus-for-regulators">
<div class="container">
<h2>The focus for regulators</h2>
<p>So what, exactly, do regulators need to be looking at?</p>
<p>NBFI leverage use is complex; there is no universal metric that will accurately capture the leverage-related risk of all NBFIs. Instead, we need a range of metrics to be assessed together.</p>
<p>For example, we understand that notional-based measures of leverage can significantly overstate the actual exposure of an NBFI and are therefore not necessarily good indicators of its risk. That said, these metrics can still be useful to regulators in monitoring the build-up of aggregate leverage across cohorts of NBFIs in specific areas.</p>
<p>To assess the risks from use of leverage at the individual NBFI level, we need to rely on other metrics such as those which capture default and liquidity risks, sensitivity to market risk, and concentration risk. Using a suite of diverse metrics will allow us to develop a better sense of the risks related to leverage use in individual NBFIs, but also to understand whether risk is building in specific segments of the markets.</p>
<p>In cases where regulators do spot systemic risk from the build-up of NBFI leverage, they have a range of tools they can consider to address and mitigate the risk. There are measures which constrain leverage indirectly, usually by increasing the cost of leverage use. These are typically applied at the activity level and are especially effective in cases where leverage use may not be properly priced with respect to the associated risks. Examples include minimum margins and haircuts on derivatives and repo transactions. On the other hand, there are also measures which constrain leverage much more directly, by imposing a limit on its use or setting some kind of resilience standard, and these are usually applied at the entity-level. Having this broad toolbox is important, as one size will not fit all. And that is fine.</p>
<p>When thinking about which measures are more effective for which circumstances, I find&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://bankunderground.co.uk/2024/09/04/a-simple-model-of-the-effects-of-entity-and-activity-constraints-on-alternative-investment-funds/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recent analysis<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;conducted by the FCA and Bank of England staff for a Bank Underground blog post particularly useful. It finds that fixed-notional leverage limits applied at the entity level can be effective when entities employ simple investment strategies in highly similar assets. However, in the case of entities which employ more complex investment strategies, fixed leverage limits are not as effective in reducing overall risk and may even increase portfolio concentration or crowd funds into certain strategies which use less leverage but may feature riskier assets. Meanwhile, activity-based measures set marginal prices on individual assets and effectively reduce risk from leverage use without the unintended shift towards higher risk assets.</p>
<p>In practice, we see these trade-offs feed into regulators&rsquo; approaches to constraining leverage. Real estate funds engage in simple investment strategies with highly similar assets, so fixed entity-based leverage limits can work to reduce risk. Meanwhile, LDI funds have not been faced with fixed limits on leverage, but instead regulators have set resilience standards to ensure these funds maintain the liquidity necessary to meet margin and collateral calls.</p>
<p>In the case of LDI funds, resilience standards were more practical to implement because they are risk sensitive, and they were feasible to design and implement as LDI funds&rsquo; risks are relatively simple and straightforward to measure. When considering more complex entities such as multi-strategy hedge funds, a fixed-notional leverage limit is unlikely to be effective in reducing risk for reasons I have just laid out, and setting a resilience standard would not be as straightforward as it was for LDI funds, as the risks in a complex fund are much harder to measure.</p>
<p>Now, what does all this mean from a regulatory perspective here in the UK? As mentioned, we see risk management by NBFIs and their counterparties as the first and second lines of defence against systemic risk from NBFI leverage use, and we are working with international peers to set out how improvements in public and private disclosure could bolster these.</p>
<p>We are also thinking about our own role as the third line of defence within the UK, and whether we have the right data and tools for performing that role. Given the FCA&rsquo;s regulatory remit and patterns of leverage use in the UK market, fund managers covered by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) will be an area of focus for us. Although it is important to note the NBFI sector is much broader than alternative investment funds.</p>
<p>The good news is we already have a large portion of the data necessary to identify risks from funds&rsquo; leverage use, so we do not need to start from scratch. That said, there may be some targeted changes we could make to our data collection to ensure we are able to assess leverage use in a comprehensive and risk-sensitive manner. We will consider this as part of our upcoming AIFMD review. We are conscious that any change in reporting will come at a cost, and so any proposals will be proportionate and subject to a full consultation and cost benefit analysis. We will also engage closely with industry on this when the time comes.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-international-collaboration">
<div class="container">
<h2>International collaboration</h2>
<p>The NBFI sector is global in nature, and so are the financial stability risks that can arise from it. And global risks often require global solutions. Therefore, in addition to collaboration with other UK authorities, international collaboration is essential for effective oversight and regulation, particularly when addressing an issue as complex as leverage.</p>
<p>Authorities need to work hard to deliver a consistent global regulatory environment. Consistency is good for firms, ensuring predictability and reducing costs. Authorities should, where possible, engage with international counterparts to enhance their supervision and monitoring efforts, and work together to improve access and use of data.</p>
<p>Of course, international collaboration brings its own challenges, especially in a period of increasing uncertainty and economic competition.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we strongly believe that co-operation brings benefits to all and supports global economic well-being. We remain as committed as ever to being an advocate not just for international co-operation, but also for the UK to be a leader in global regulatory innovation.</p>
<p>As such, I&rsquo;m pleased to be co-chairing the FSB&rsquo;s Working Group on Leverage in NBFI (WGLN) alongside Cornelia Holthausen of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>The WGLN is a core component of the FSB&rsquo;s ongoing NBFI work programme and is carrying out significant work on addressing financial stability risks arising from NBFI leverage on a global level. Its current consultation report is ambitious, requiring authorities to identify and monitor financial stability risks, and then to address those risks that they identify. But the proposals that are set out are flexible and outcomes focused, allowing authorities to select and calibrate policy tools in a way that is appropriate to the specific risks that exist within individual jurisdictions, and to combine complementary tools where necessary, to deliver a consistent set of agreed outcomes.</p>
<p>The consultation focuses on availability of data and metrics to help identify financial stability risks arising from leverage &ndash; and then on the policy measures that jurisdictions could employ to respond in circumstances where financial stability risks arise. In many cases, the issues highlighted in the report are the same ones that the FCA is already prioritising in our domestic work.</p>
<p>We encourage you to actively participate in the FSB consultation &ndash; it is open until the end of this month. I&rsquo;d also like to ask for your future help as we seek to reform the data that is obtained via AIFMD through our reform work this year &ndash; making sure that the right data exists to help the first, second and third lines of defence monitor and proactively manage their levels of risk is important.</p>
<p>We are cognisant of the need to avoid unduly burdening firms, disrupting investment and hedging activities- and we know that leverage delivers benefits. But we believe there is scope for improvement.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-helping-markets-thrive">
<div class="container">
<h2>Helping markets thrive</h2>
<p>To turn back to where we started: what does all of this mean for our garden of financial markets? There&rsquo;s no simple answer to that question. Ultimately, though, it&rsquo;s about making sure we&rsquo;re all equipped with the knowledge and tools we need to help the garden flourish. We need to ensure that our plants have the right amount of sunshine, water, and nutrients to grow &ndash; that they are resilient enough to manage the weather or any unexpected storms and that we can detect the storms that may be brewing.</p>
<p>As a final comment, I want to emphasise how vital it is that the voices of firms operating in the UK are heard during the policy development process, both domestically and internationally. To those of you that have already responded to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/leverage-in-non-bank-financial-intermediation-consultation-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WGLN consultation<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; thank you. Your comments will help us strengthen our final set of policy recommendations. Thank you also to the IA for hosting today&rsquo;s event. I look forward to hearing from you all in our roundtable discussion.</p>

<li><span>It is the third company to register an Initial Access Document for the growth markets of BME this year</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Market Coordination and Incorporations Committee considers that&nbsp;<span>BETTER CONSULTANTS</span>&nbsp;will meet the requirements to join BME Scaleup. It is the third company to register an Initial Access Document to the growth markets of BME so far this year.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the company, has taken as a reference for the start of trading of the shares a price of &euro;4 per share, which implies a total valuation of the company of &euro;8.17 million.</p>
<p><span>BETTER CONSULTANTS</span>&nbsp;has been advised by&nbsp;<span>GVC Gaesco Valores</span>, which has acted as Registered Advisor and Agent Entity, and&nbsp;<span>Cuatrecasas Gon&ccedil;alves Pereira</span>, which has provided legal advice in the incorporation process and conducted the legal due diligence.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ASX Welcomes ASIC Discussion Paper</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX welcomes the discussion paper and public consultation announced by ASIC today on the dynamics between public and private markets in Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>James Posnett, ASX General Manager for Listings, said:</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome the discussion paper and public consultation that ASIC has announced today. Given the fundamental role of capital markets to our economy, they should be regularly reviewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both public and private markets are independently important, but should also be complementary to each other. The growth of private markets in Australia is beneficial to public markets, as assets held in private funds will ultimately need liquidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public markets activity, particularly for new listings, is cyclical. We&rsquo;ve seen early momentum in a recovery for new listings, but as an operator of public markets we support a review of changing market dynamics, and if the regulatory settings need to adapt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;ASX is a firm advocate for making it simpler for listed entities, and there is ongoing work to continuously improve Listing Rules and processes. We&rsquo;re also assessing initiatives to streamline the IPO process, including changes which aim to help reduce risk for investors and issuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will continue to listen and engage with our customers, ASIC and the industry so we can improve the experience for new and existing listed entities and drive a dynamic and globally competitive listed market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore: Civil Penalty Actions Taken Against Five Individuals For False And Unauthorised Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-civil-penalty-actions-taken-against-five-indivi-2025226/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has imposed civil penalties against four individuals, Mr Aw Yong Leon Heng, Mr Neo Say Hwee, Mr Chang Bing Quan Daryl, Mr Cheng Jia Hong, and a trading representative Mr Tan Keng Cheng, for abetting Mr Lim Tiong Hian<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2025/civil-penalty-actions-taken-against-five-individuals-for-false-and-unauthorised-trading#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;in false trading and the related unauthorised use of trading accounts under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). These enforcement actions are a result of a joint investigation conducted by MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police Force, following a referral from the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited</span>.</p>
<p>2<span> </span><span>From January to May 2019, Mr Lim approached three friends &ndash; Mr Aw Yong, Mr Neo and Mr Chang &ndash; to trade in the shares of Epicentre Holdings Limited (Epicentre). Mr Neo subsequently approached Mr Cheng to engage in the same trading activity. The quartet falsely raised the price of Epicentre shares from $0.085 to $0.104, and falsely maintained the price of Epicentre shares, on behalf of Mr Lim</span>.</p>
<p>3<span> </span><span>In addition to placing the false Epicentre trades in their personal trading accounts, Mr Neo and Mr Chang also provided their login credentials to Mr Aw Yong, for Mr Aw Yong to access their trading accounts online to similarly place false trades in Epicentre. Mr Neo and Mr Cheng allowed Mr Aw Yong to place the trades in their accounts through their trading representative, Mr Tan, without formal third-party authorisation. In this regard, Mr Tan deceived the brokerage house into believing that Mr Neo and Mr Cheng had instructed Mr Tan to place the Epicentre trades, and were the beneficial owners of the traded shares, when Mr Tan knew that the instructions were from Mr Aw Yong</span>.</p>
<p>4<span> </span><span>The five individuals have admitted to contraventions of the SFA and have paid the following civil penalty amounts to MAS as part of settlement agreements:</span></p>
<p><span> </span>a.<span> </span>Mr Aw Yong, $150,000 for abetment of false trading and unauthorised trading;<br /><span> </span>b.<span> </span>Mr Neo, $100,000 for abetment of false trading, abetment of unauthorised trading, and unauthorised trading;<br /><span> </span>c.<span> </span>Mr Chang, $75,000 for abetment of false trading, abetment of unauthorised trading and unauthorised trading;<br /><span> </span>d.<span> </span>Mr Tan, $65,000 for unauthorised trading ; and<br /><span> </span>e.<span> </span>Mr Cheng, $50,000 for unauthorised trading</p>
<p><span>***</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 11px;"><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2025/civil-penalty-actions-taken-against-five-individuals-for-false-and-unauthorised-trading#1-footnote-1">[1]</a></span><span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span><span class="footnote-item-content" id="footnote-1" style="background-color: initial; font-size: 11px;">Mr Lim, also known as Kenneth Lim, is the former Chairman of Epicentre Holdings Limited.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>_______________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Additional Information</span></span></p>
<p><span>(A) The civil penalty regime</span></p>
<p>A civil penalty action is not a criminal action and does not attract criminal sanctions. The civil penalty regime, designed to complement criminal sanctions and provide a nuanced approach to combat market misconduct, became operational at the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p>Under section 232 of the SFA, MAS may enter into an agreement with any person for that person to pay, with or without admission of liability, a civil penalty for contravening any provision of Part 12 of the SFA. The civil penalty may be up to three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided by that person as a result of the contravention, subject to a minimum of $50,000 (if the person is not a corporation) or $100,000 (if the person is a corporation)</p>
<p><span>(B)&nbsp;False trading under section 197(1)(b) of the SFA</span></p>
<p>Under section 197(1)(b) of the SFA, no person shall do any thing,&nbsp; cause any thing to be done or engage in any course of conduct, if his purpose, or any of his purposes, for doing that thing, causing that thing to be done or engaging in that course of conduct, as the case may be, is to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, securities.</p>
<p><span>(C)</span>&nbsp;<span>Unauthorised trading under section 201(b) of the SFA</span></p>
<p>Under section 201(b) of the SFA, no person shall, directly or indirectly, in connection with the subscription, purchase or sale of any securities engage in any act, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deception, or is likely to operate as a fraud or deception, upon any person.</p>
<p><span>(D)&nbsp;Abetment under Section 109 of the PC</span></p>
<p><span>Under section 109 of the PC, whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by the PC for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.</span></p>

<title>ASIC: Advancing Australia’s Regulatory Roadmap For Public And Private Capital Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has announced its preliminary views on the opportunities and risks emerging from shifts in public and private capital markets and called for feedback and debate on key questions as part of a discussion paper launched today.</p>
<p>The paper,&nbsp;<em>Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/dp-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-a-discussion-paper-on-the-dynamics-between-public-and-private-markets/" title="DP 1 Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets">DISCUSSION PAPER</a>), opens a discussion on ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory approach and seeks actionable ideas for it to consider to enhance the operation of Australia&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<p>The paper explores the changing dynamics in capital markets, in Australia and abroad, including declining listings on public markets, the rapid growth in investment capital allocated to private markets and the influence of superannuation funds on markets.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the discussion paper was one of the most significant initiatives of the year for the regulator.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC is determined to achieve dual goals with this paper by ensuring Australia&rsquo;s markets are attractive to companies and investors while protecting against risks,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Public and private markets support one another, and both are critical to our economy, so it&rsquo;s important we approach this from both an opportunity and risk perspective. The critical point for ASIC is whether there is a need for interventions to address risk or adjustment to how regulation operates to take advantage of opportunities important for the attractiveness of our capital markets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t be complacent about the future of Australia&rsquo;s public equity markets. While history tells us that the current downturn in Australian IPOs and public companies is likely cyclical, deterioration in the quality, diversity and depth of public companies would have significant adverse effects on the economy and on investors&rsquo; participation in it. While we don&rsquo;t see regulatory settings as the dominant factor here, there may be opportunities to adjust in order to improve the attractiveness of our markets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are also concerned about the private credit market. While it does not appear to be systemically important in Australia, failures are on the horizon, and at current volumes it is untested by prior crises.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are keen to understand how the growing dominance of superannuation in Australia&rsquo;s economy is influencing our markets, given its crucial role in securing our financial wellbeing on retirement.</p>
<p>'We note our international peer regulators have access to more reliable and recurrent data on private markets to enhance their transparency. This makes it easier to identify risks as well as opportunities. At present, ASIC&rsquo;s data and information gathering powers are inefficient and incomplete. We simply can&rsquo;t do our job properly if we are in the dark,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>Internationally, regulators are reviewing their regulatory settings in response to these changes in capital markets, with some focusing on strengthening their public markets and others moving to address vulnerabilities identified with transparency and investor protection in private markets. Key risks of concern include opacity, valuation uncertainty, conflicts of interest, illiquidity and leverage in private markets, which includes private equity and private credit markets.</p>
<p>Feedback on the discussion paper questions is due by 5pm on 28 April 2025. Details on responding can be found in the discussion paper.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As Australia&rsquo;s financial markets regulator, ASIC has been engaging with a wide spectrum of perspectives through panels, forums and structured engagements on the evolving public and private market dynamics.</p>
<p>In conjunction with this paper, ASIC commissioned a research report by Dr Carole Comerton-Forde,&nbsp;<em>Evaluating the state of the Australian public equity market: Evidence from data and academic literature</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-807-evaluating-the-state-of-the-australian-public-equity-market-evidence-from-data-and-academic-literature/" title="REP 807 Evaluating the state of the Australian public equity market: Evidence from data and academic literature">REP 807</a>), which has informed ASIC&rsquo;s approach in this paper.</p>
<p>As private markets grow, ASIC is increasing its supervision of private equity funds, private credit funds and their advisers. In 2025, ASIC&rsquo;s thematic surveillance of private equity and private credit funds is focusing on fund governance, valuation practices, management of conflicts of interest and fair treatment of investors. Additionally, for retail private credit funds, ASIC will test compliance with disclosure and distribution obligations.</p>
<p>The discussion paper follows ASIC&rsquo;s report,&nbsp;<em>Equity market cleanliness snapshot report</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-786-equity-market-cleanliness-snapshot-report/" title="REP 786 Equity market cleanliness snapshot report">REP 786</a>), released in July 2024. The market cleanliness report showed Australia&rsquo;s equity markets have continued to operate with a high level of integrity and remain consistently among the cleanest in the world. The report provided a broader context for the findings in Report 787&nbsp;<em>Review of Australian equity market cleanliness: 1 November 2018 to 30 April 2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-787-review-of-australian-equity-market-cleanliness-1-november-2018-to-30-april-2024/" title="REP 787 Review of Australian equity market cleanliness: 1 November 2018 to 30 April 2024">REP 787</a>).</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On SEC Extension Of Compliance Dates For Treasury Clearing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-sec-extension-of-compliance-dates-for-treasury-clearing-2025226/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-sec-extension-of-compliance-dates-for-treasury-clearing-2025226/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>SIFMA today issued the following statement from Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., president and CEO, on the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-43?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">extension</a>&nbsp;of the compliance dates for Treasury clearing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA commends Acting Chairman Uyeda and the Commission for taking the step to extend the implementation date for mandated central clearing of Treasury securities and repurchase agreements. Given the importance of the Treasury market to the financial system and the economy, along with the expected significant issuance of Treasury securities in the coming years, it is essential that the implementation timeline for the clearing rules allows for a smooth transition so as not to disrupt this market. For the past year, we have been working with our members, both buy side and sell side, and other market participants to develop standardized documentation, policies and procedures to facilitate the transition to mandated central clearing. While we have seen continued uptick in cleared cash and repo Treasuries, market participants have become increasingly concerned that the original implementation dates were overly aggressive and would add unnecessary risk to the nation&rsquo;s and world&rsquo;s most important asset market. Further, as we have documented over the past year, there remains the need for critical regulatory guidance to facilitate the transition in total. While the action by the Commission is the most prudent course, no one should interpret this as the industry and the market stepping back from central clearing. The industry will continue to plow forward with our work to accomplish the mandate set out in the rule.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SEC Extends Compliance Dates And Provides Temporary Exemption For Rule Related To Clearing Of U.S. Treasury Securities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-extends-compliance-dates-and-provides-temporary-exemption-for-rule-related-t-2025226/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-extends-compliance-dates-and-provides-temporary-exemption-for-rule-related-t-2025226/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today extended the compliance dates for Rule 17ad-22(e)(18)(iv)(A) and (B) under the Securities Exchange Act by one year to Dec. 31, 2026, for eligible cash market transactions, and June 30, 2027, for eligible repo market transactions. Under the rule, a covered clearing agency that provides central counterparty services for U.S. Treasury securities must establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require that every direct participant of the covered clearing agency submit for clearance and settlement all eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to which it is a counterparty. The rule also requires a covered clearing agency to identify and monitor its direct participants&rsquo; submissions of transactions for clearing, including how the covered clearing agency would address a failure to submit transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission also issued a temporary exemption regarding Exchange Act Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i). This rule requires that covered clearing agencies have written policies and procedures reasonably designed to calculate, collect, and hold margin amounts from a direct participant for its proprietary positions in U.S. Treasury securities separately and independently from margin calculated and collected from that direct participant in connection with U.S. Treasury securities transactions by an indirect participant that relies on the services provided by the direct participant to access the U.S. Treasury securities covered clearing agency&rsquo;s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities. Under this temporary exemption, a U.S. Treasury securities covered clearing agency is not required to enforce its written policies and procedures regarding Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i) until Sept. 30, 2025, instead of the original March 31, 2025, compliance date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. Treasury market is a critical piece of the global financial system. New rules must be implemented properly, and any operational issues must be addressed,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. &ldquo;This one-year extension provides additional time to implement and validate operational changes. Direct participants will also have more time to implement important risk management changes to comply with U.S. Treasury covered clearing agency rules. The Commission stands ready to engage with market participants on issues associated with implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extension will provide additional time for further engagement on compliance, operational, and interpretive questions, and facilitate an orderly implementation of the rules. The temporary exemption allows covered clearing agencies not to enforce policies and procedures established pursuant to Rule 17ad-22(e)(6)(i) against any market participants currently clearing indirect participant activity that are not ready to comply with such policies and procedures, but it does not affect the ability of a covered clearing agency to implement such policies and procedures for those that are prepared to comply. If a direct participant of a U.S. Treasury covered clearing agency determines to offer certain access models or segregated margin accounts, the covered clearing agency would be obligated to enforce those rules regarding such models or accounts against the relevant participant, and the direct participant must comply with those rules.</p>

<title>Remarks To The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, Mark T. Uyeda, SEC Acting Chairman, Washington D.C., Feb. 25, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. Welcome to the first meeting for the Committee in 2025. I expect that this year will be a busy and exciting one for this Committee as I have asked the Commission staff to explore ways to improve capital-raising opportunities for entrepreneurs and to empower retail investment in private companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-sbcfac-022525#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These topics are at the heart of this Committee&rsquo;s expertise, and I hope that you will have opportunities to share your views with the staff, the Commission, and the public.</p>
<p>Turning to today&rsquo;s agenda, I am pleased that the Committee continues to discuss ways to support and facilitate capital formation for emerging fund managers. The lack of appropriately tailored disclosure for smaller advisers starting their business is concerning, because it can lead to disproportionate compliance burdens and create barriers to entry. I look forward to reviewing the input from Ashok Kamal and Sara Zulkosky on these issues, and any recommendations from the Committee to address them.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the Committee will discuss the challenges faced by small public companies that are not listed on a national securities exchange. I believe that scaled disclosure requirements is important for smaller companies, as the costs for preparing disclosure can disproportionately burden smaller companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-sbcfac-022525#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Small public companies that are not listed on an exchange may face even more unique challenges. For example, unlisted companies with a public float of less than $75 million are ineligible to use shelf registration statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-sbcfac-022525#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>There may also be investor protection concerns associated with small companies whose stock have relatively low liquidity and may be more prone to manipulation. However, do these concerns justify not permitting small companies &ndash; that may be in greater need for capital than larger, listed companies &ndash; to use shelf registration statements and quickly access the capital markets when timing and other conditions are ideal? I look forward to reviewing a readout of Dan Zinn&rsquo;s thoughts on this and other issues facing small, unlisted companies, as well as the Committee&rsquo;s discussion on potential solutions to those issues.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I hope that you have a productive meeting.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Erica. Thank you to the Committee for your continued work and to today&rsquo;s panelists for presenting today. I recently read Olympian Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone&rsquo;s book, which inspired me to re-watch several of her races.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-022525#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;She set the world record in the 400 meter hurdles but did so with such ease that the hurdles almost seem like a non-event to the viewer. Her book made clear, however, that gliding over hurdles at breakneck speed requires not only a lot of natural talent but also hard work, persistence, tough lessons, and pain.</p>
<p>Of course, her story made me think of emerging fund managers and small public companies. Celebrating managers and companies that have succeeded in building thriving enterprises is wonderfully exhilarating, but we sometimes forget the difficult journey that brought them to success. Hard work is unavoidable and nearly every founder and fund manager has endured trials along the way, but regulation can increase or ameliorate the burdens. Today&rsquo;s discussion and any ensuing recommendations can help the Commission identify regulatory hurdles that are impeding emerging fund managers and small public companies.</p>
<p>I am glad that the discussion of how best to support emerging fund managers and facilitate capital formation is continuing. An important piece of the puzzle is understanding how fund managers and angel investors find each other in the marketplace and develop relationships that facilitate a mutually beneficial deployment of capital. As the committee discussed previously, such professional relationships can be harder to form without pre-existing familial or personal relationships. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing any recommendations that these conversations generate.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the Committee will turn to issues further along in the start-up lifecycle: how small public companies think about access to capital and the cost of regulatory compliance. Our regulatory framework should ensure that at every stage of growth companies have access to capital with the end goal of becoming publicly traded so that all investors can participate in future growth. The once aspirational goal of becoming a public company seems to have lost its luster, but we can change that by identifying and addressing the hurdles to going and staying public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-022525#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some questions for your consideration during today&rsquo;s meeting:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the biggest impediments or market conditions swaying private companies away from entering the public markets?</li>
<li>Once public, what are the most pronounced costs newly public companies bear and how could the Commission mitigate any costs that are necessary for investor protection and eliminate costs that lack a concomitant investor protection benefit?</li>
<li>What changes should the Commission make to ease the burden on smaller public companies and public companies not listed on a national exchange?</li>

<title>Managing Financial Crises, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr, At Yale School of Management, Program on Financial Stability, New Haven, Connecticut</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I note that the objectives of the Program on Financial Stability include "supporting the world's financial authorities in refining proven crises management tools and strategies."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Speaking as a representative of one of those authorities, I thought I would further the program's goals by focusing these remarks on the principles and practice of crisis management. I am favored in that task with what one might call the luck of having been regularly confronted with crises in each of my three stints as a public servant, over a career divided between government and academia. In noting how often my arrival in government was accompanied by crisis, it might be reasonable to wonder if this is correlation or causation.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, crisis management is central to all management because it demands the very best from managers when it is most needed. Anyone who spends time in government can expect that some of the most memorable and challenging experiences will be managing through tough situations, when the answers to problems are unclear but the mission of the organization comes into acute focus. The financial system is in a perpetual state balancing risk and reward. Sometimes the system falls out of balance, and vulnerabilities turn into stress or even crisis. This moment is when it is crucial to mitigate spillovers from the financial system that can hurt businesses and households and wreak havoc on the economy at large.</p>
<p>Some of the most important features of modern economies were developed to prevent and mitigate financial crises. The first central banks, and eventually the Federal Reserve, were created to provide stable currencies and banking systems in support of the long-term stability of the provision of credit necessary to foster growth and rising living standards. Regulation of financial markets, regulation and supervision of banks, federal deposit insurance, and laws to protect investors, consumers, and businesses were developed over time to promote both financial stability and durable economic growth. I have spoken previously about how monetary policy and financial stability are inextricably linked and how the tools we use to conduct monetary policy and support financial stability work together.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In the spring of 2023, the United States faced the prospect of a spiraling stress event, when poor management and excessive risk-taking by Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) led to a run that quickly spread to other banks and threatened the wider banking system. Shortcomings in supervision and gaps in the regulatory framework also contributed to SVB's failure, and I've spoken about the steps the Federal Reserve has taken to improve supervision and other steps to close regulatory gaps.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Today, I'd like to talk about how effective management of the banking stress in the spring of 2023 helped prevent that event from spiraling into a financial crisis.</p>
<p>Given our student audience, I will begin with a little background on how I got into the crisis management business. After Yale Law School and two court clerkships, I worked at the State Department and then went to work for Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin in 1995. When I arrived, the Treasury Department had helped Mexico deal with a financial crisis that threatened to spread to the United States, and additional crises were to come in 1997 in Asia and in 1998 in Russia. Together, these events credibly threatened a worldwide financial crisis, which was averted by a response across the U.S. government and coordinated with governments and lending institutions around the world. I left government for academia in 2001 and then returned to Treasury in 2009 under Secretary Tim Geithner, in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). I worked to develop what became known as the Dodd-Frank Act. This law was a pivotal component of our response to the GFC by addressing gaps in financial market oversight, including through strengthened regulation and supervision of banks that increased the safeguards against the excessive risk-taking that caused the crisis. I went back to academia again in 2011 and then returned to public service as the Federal Reserve Board's Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022. In this position, I oversaw the response to the bank failures in March 2023 and have helped develop ways to reduce these and other risks going forward.</p>
<p><strong>The March 2023 Banking Stress</strong><br />Let me review some facts about what happened, so you can understand the context for how we put crisis management principles and practices to work.</p>
<p>SVB failed because of a textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;This mismanagement made uninsured depositors lose confidence in the bank's solvency, so they ran. While this was a textbook case, the speed and severity of the run were unprecedented. The largest previous bank failure before SVB was of Washington Mutual in 2008.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The accumulation of stresses that resulted in Washington Mutual's failure occurred over several weeks. By contrast, SVB's deposit outflows were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours. On top of that, the bank had major gaps in its liquidity risk management, including its preparedness to tap contingency liquidity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>Because this discussion is for future first responders, I will share with you some detail about what it's like to be on the front lines working to address a bank run. On the morning of Thursday, March 9, 2023, SVB had only a little over $5 billion in collateral pledged to the discount window, as compared to over $150 billion in uninsured deposits.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Around midday, the firm contacted the Federal Reserve, indicating that it wanted to take out a discount window loan against this collateral, and the loan was granted. But in the next several hours, its account was drained as its deposit outflows spiraled. In the late afternoon, the firm indicated that it would need additional liquidity to meet expected outflows. The Federal Reserve worked with the firm to help it identify additional assets it could pledge to the discount window, but SVB was unsuccessful in identifying and moving sufficient collateral. Fed staff worked with the firm through the night to establish ad hoc collateral arrangements, so that the firm could tap the discount window further to meet its liquidity needs in the morning.</p>
<p>While this process was happening overnight, however, the volume of online deposit withdrawal requests was growing, such that SVB management expected outflows of over $100 billion the next day, an unprecedented sum.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Even if the bank were able to pledge all collateral available that morning to the discount window, the firm would not have been able to meet its obligations. It was not viable. The state of California closed the bank and turned it over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for resolution.</p>
<p>SVB's failure contributed to the strains at FDIC-supervised Signature Bank, and that bank failed in short order. As the situation intensified, the effects on businesses and households became increasingly apparent. Critically, these failures caused a reassessment of the viability of uninsured deposits as a funding source across the banking system. But strains at other banks materialized despite material differences between these firms. The rapidity of equity market price declines for several banks triggered repeated trading halts for their shares. Online deposits began to migrate out of smaller banks to larger banks, putting pressure on these smaller institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Commercial customers that had remaining deposits at SVB after it failed realized that they would not have access to their deposits and thus wouldn't be able to make payroll or even stay in business.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>The severity and rapidity of the spread of stress warranted a decisive response. We developed a two-part strategy that weekend.</p>
<p>On March 12, the Treasury Secretary, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve announced that the FDIC would protect uninsured deposits at SVB and Signature Bank under the systemic risk exception to least-cost resolution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This action essentially implied that all depositors, insured and uninsured, would have access to their deposits Monday morning. And the step helped calm uninsured depositors around the country.</p>
<p>Also on March 12, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) under its emergency lending authority with the approval of and a backstop from the Treasury.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The BTFP's terms and conditions addressed the fundamental source of banking-sector jitters: questions about the ability of a range of banks to hold onto their high-quality securities that had lost value because of interest rate increases. Unrealized losses on securities portfolios were a problem for many banks, particularly when the stability of their deposit bases came into question. The BTFP provided stable funding for these high-quality assets, addressing these concerns. Specifically, the BTFP provided one-year loans to banks in sound financial condition against Treasury securities and agency securities, valued at par.</p>
<p>By doing so, the BTFP addressed banks' immediate concerns about the stability of their funding and mitigated the risk that banks would be forced to liquidate assets in a fire sale, locking in losses. BTFP advances provided confidence that banks would have sufficient funding to retain the securities on balance sheet. The program supported confidence among depositors that their banks would have ready access to sufficient cash to meet their needs, thus helping reduce concern that a self-fulfilling panic could cause additional bank runs.</p>
<p>Usage of the BTFP was widespread across the banking sector, both in terms of actual usage and from a contingency standpoint. For example, at its peak, BTFP borrowing exceeded $160 billion, and collateral posted to the BTFP reached nearly $540 billion, suggesting that banks saw value in being prepared and having capacity to tap the facility if necessary. Over 1,800 institutions borrowed from the program, and the bulk of the borrowing was among institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. These smaller institutions took out 50 percent of loans by value and nearly 95 percent of loans by volume. Fed staff analysis showed the usage was more likely among institutions that had experienced deposit outflows, but usage was also widespread at firms that did not experience outflows. The broad-based actual and contingency use was consistent with Federal Reserve communications that the program was part of prudent liquidity management and that we encouraged all depository institutions to use the program. Now, about two weeks before all remaining outstanding BTFP loans are set to mature, the program is down to less than $200 million, and the program has experienced no losses.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>Our response to the stress worked. After the announcement of the systemic risk exception and the BTFP in early March, signs of broad-based contagion subsided, and the system stabilized. While in the first two weeks of March midsize and regional banks experienced significant outflows of deposits, the acute phase of outflows had eased by the end of the month. Stability among banks that had earlier come under pressure didn't mean that every bank found its footing, but the process of dealing with balance sheet gaps was much smoother and spillovers remained contained. By the fall of that year, deposit flows had fully stabilized and midsize and regional banks saw deposit inflows on net.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Additional Stress beyond Silicon Valley and Signature Banks</strong><br />While the announcement of the systemic risk exception and the BTFP on March 13, 2023, helped stabilize banks in the United States, we were also continuing to manage stress in the global financial system in cooperation with relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse, a Swiss global systemically important banking organization, had been experiencing stress over several years before March 2023, with doubts about its future viability after the Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital scandals had tarnished its reputation and raised doubts about its business model. Stress and outflows at Credit Suisse picked up in the fall of 2022, and we spent many months working with Swiss, European, and U.K. regulators on how to manage the growing issues, including war-gaming potential resolution scenarios. Concerns about the firm's viability accelerated on March 9, 2023, when it was forced to announce that its internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective and had been for several years. Though Credit Suisse continued to operate, it became apparent that the firm was in trouble in the week following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank.</p>
<p>Just one week after SVB failed, Swiss authorities arranged for Credit Suisse to be acquired by UBS in a weekend deal that involved triggering Credit Suisse's contingent convertible capital instruments, a severe dilution of shareholders, and the removal of senior bank management, as well as emergency liquidity support and extraordinary loss sharing from the Swiss government.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;In a sense, Credit Suisse had failed very slowly over many months&mdash;even years&mdash;and then all at once.</p>
<p>The combination of these events involved coordination across U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, with careful monitoring and cooperation to identify risks to financial stability and to monitor spillovers to the U.S. and European banking systems.</p>
<p>Back in the United States, we worked with our domestic counterparts as a handful of additional banks remained under pressure in the months that followed. Notably FDIC-supervised First Republic Bank was closed on May 1, 2023. First Republic had also experienced tremendous stress in March, as it suffered deposit outflows of nearly 20 percent in a single day.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;First Republic withstood these outflows in part because of significant discount window lending, as well as the extraordinary coordination among several other banks that placed significant deposits at the bank&mdash;worth $30 billion. But over time, it became clear that First Republic's rapid and large deposit outflows and unrealized losses on loans and securities would lead to its failure as well.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>While these were the events that got the headlines, the Federal Reserve continuously monitored other banks with potential balance sheet vulnerabilities, including those with gaps in interest rate and liquidity risk management, as well as significant exposures to office commercial real estate. We worked with these firms to ensure they addressed their vulnerabilities, while they bolstered their liquidity positions to manage potential stress. For example, overall, from March 2023 to March 2024, banks of all sizes and condition, including many not under direct stress, pledged more than $1 trillion in additional collateral to the discount window. Banks and supervisors took a wide variety of steps to shore up resilience throughout the system.</p>
<p><strong>Principles and Practices for Managing Financial-Sector Stress</strong><br />When a crisis hits, the stakes are high. In the GFC, millions of Americans lost their homes, their jobs, and their dreams for their futures, when savings for education and retirement disappeared with the collapse of asset prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;The contraction in credit hurt small businesses and families all across the country. When banks can't carry out their role in supplying credit to those who need it, the effects are severe and widespread.</p>
<p>With those stakes in mind, here are five key principles that I learned in my experiences managing financial crises.</p>
<p>First, crisis response needs to be forceful. The factor that transforms a series of unfortunate events into a self-sustaining crisis is the belief that there is no end in sight and no prospect of a sufficient response. While we could debate whether every aspect of the GFC response was necessary, one clear lesson from this experience, and from other crises I have been involved in, is how important it is that the response be forceful enough to convince market participants and the broader public that there is a capability and the will to overcome the crisis.</p>
<p>A second principle is that the response should be proportionate. While a forceful response is important to bolster confidence in the prospects for gaining control over the crisis, the response also must avoid shaking confidence by suggesting that conditions are worse than they seem. In a crisis, information is spread unevenly. A response that is out of proportion&mdash;for example, by touching aspects of the financial system not considered endangered&mdash;can be misinterpreted as providing vital information about the extent of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Another key component of crisis management is the need to engage in decisionmaking amid significant uncertainty. I explained how the response needs to be both forceful and proportionate. Finding this balance requires making tough judgments amid rapidly evolving conditions. Crisis managers need to make consequential decisions quickly with the recognition that their understanding of the facts is incomplete. Even the best of efforts to understand what is happening and what is needed will be unsatisfactory in the moment. Decisionmaking under these conditions takes some courage. It also takes humility: the ability to listen to others around you, gather different perspectives, and weigh the imperfect information in real time.</p>
<p>A fourth principle is the need for clear communication&mdash;internally to the teams working on the response and externally to the public. And these communications need to be consistent with each other and with the values of the institution, even if tailored to the particular audience. Clear internal communication provides direction to the crisis response teams and facilitates coordination across relevant public-sector actors. Clear external communication, when grounded in a realistic assessment of the situation, can calm markets and reassure the public about the strategy. And clear communication is a two-way street: It involves listening to internal and external perspectives, as well as speaking in a way that can be heard.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the fifth principle I would cite, which is accountability. Financial crises come about because of a lack of confidence in counterparties and among other participants in the financial system. It is crucial for crisis responders to be credible and accountable not only for assessing the root causes of the crisis, but also for addressing these causes and the aftermath. That requires staying focused on the long-term goals for reform even as crisis management remains critically important and urgent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a></p>
<p><strong>Practices for Effective Management under Periods of Stress</strong><br />These are important principles, and I will talk a little bit about some of the practices we used as we were guided by these principles. One crucial component of successful management of a stress event is to gather the most relevant information as quickly as possible. In a large and complex organization, it is necessary to overcome barriers to information flow across functions. In the case of the March 2023 banking stress, we drew from across the functions of the central bank to gather real-time information necessary to assess the severity of the conditions facing troubled institutions and also to identify potential levers of response.</p>
<p>Supervisors generally have real-time information from a bank as it undergoes stress, but this information needs to be put into context with foundational knowledge about the firm, such as the current structure of its balance sheet and typical payment flows. While we managed an influx of reports about deposit flows at banks, it was important to be able to immediately put the size of the outflows in context and corroborate anecdotal reports against multiple sources, including from our own systems. Our next step is to assess a firm's capacity to weather additional stress. First responders can assess if the firm has maximized the liquidity potential of its assets, including through its relationships with liquidity providers. And one needs to assess these firms' connections to the rest of the financial sector and identify interlinkages and spillovers. Leaning on experts who engage in broader monitoring of financial markets and engage in outreach with well-established contacts can be important. A team of staff who have the capacity to think broadly across the institution and draw on the partnerships they have built with a range of business lines is necessary to support the kind of information gathering and strategizing that are crucial for consequential decisions. This is why an institutional culture that supports curiosity and openness to ideas and inquiry from the most junior to the most senior staff is foundational.</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned the principle of needing to be accountable to the public about the sources of the crisis and to address the underlying vulnerabilities that led to it. On March 13, 2023, in consultation with Chair Powell, I requested a review of the failure of SVB. Self-evaluation is the first step in any sound risk-management framework. Experienced career staff from across the Federal Reserve System who were not involved in SVB's supervision reviewed the reasons for the bank's failure.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;The review helped identify where the supervisory and regulatory functions of the Federal Reserve could be improved. Additional reviews by external independent parties, which we welcomed, reached similar conclusions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;More broadly, carefully considering the underlying vulnerabilities that contributed to the stress helped the Fed develop proposals for how the supervisory and regulatory framework could be improved.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250225a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />No leader looks forward to managing through a crisis, but those who hope to be good leaders need to be good crisis managers. These are skills that are most effectively developed through hard experience, but we can also learn from those who have gone through the experiences. In my case, the lessons of dealing with financial crises as a government official have revealed to me some basic principles that I believe can be useful to crisis managers. I have also learned that the best crisis management occurs beforehand, by strengthening rules and norms and other structures meant to reduce the risk of a crisis in the first place and by fostering organizational values and culture that will help manage a crisis when it comes.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and welcome to this ISDA panel on US Treasury clearing. Thanks for joining us today for what I&rsquo;m sure will be a very insightful discussion.</p>
<p>There is something a little incongruous about meeting here in Frankfurt to talk about a regulation that originates several thousand miles away in Washington. You&rsquo;d expect an event like this to focus on EMIR or MIFID, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Treasury market. But these reforms have truly global significance, and the impact will be felt around the world, including here in Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often referred to the Treasury market as the oil that keeps the wheels of global finance turning. With outstanding issuance of nearly $30 trillion, this is the world&rsquo;s most systemically important market, and its deep liquidity and resilience attract public- and private-sector investors around the world. It underpins the secured dollar funding market globally and serves as collateral for a significant volume of derivatives transactions.</p>
<p>Given the widespread reliance on US Treasuries, it&rsquo;s critical that any changes to the market structure are implemented at an appropriate pace to avoid unintended consequences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been more than a year since the SEC finalized its planned reforms in December 2023, and the deadlines are fast approaching. At the end of this year, clearing will become mandatory for certain cash Treasury securities, with repos due to follow from June 30, 2026. Work is well underway to prepare for this transition, but there are significant legal, operational and capital issues that must be resolved before clearing can be effectively implemented. In these remarks, I&rsquo;ll briefly explore those issues and explain why the timelines must be revisited.</p>
<p>But first, let me tell you why this should matter to non-US entities. The SEC rules compel clearing agencies to adjust their policies and procedures to require members to clear the relevant products by the prescribed deadline. This includes trades conducted by those member firms or their branches with any counterparty, including those based outside the US. Given the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) has about 200 direct members, including non-US banks, we expect the number of in-scope entities around the world to run into the thousands.</p>
<p>In short, if you trade cash US Treasury bonds or repos, irrespective of whether you&rsquo;re based in Washington, DC or Warsaw, you&rsquo;ll likely be in scope.</p>
<p>Clearing houses are working hard to prepare for the rules. FICC published proposed changes to its rule book last year, while CME Group recently published proposals for a new clearing service. ICE has also announced it will launch a Treasury clearing service. To assist the market, ISDA has published a comparison of various clearing models for US Treasury transactions and derivatives, which we&rsquo;ll update as new models emerge.</p>
<p>In tandem with this work, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) is leading an industry group that&rsquo;s making steady progress in developing appropriate documentation. However, this documentation needs to reflect the various clearing models and rule books that are still being developed, as well as client segregation solutions, some of which haven&rsquo;t been finalized and tested.</p>
<p>Dealers will then need to execute the new documents with thousands of counterparties, as well as obtain netting opinions to ensure efficient capital treatment.</p>
<p>We know from the implementation of the margin rules for non-cleared derivatives that this is a huge amount of work, and it will take a lot of time. Remember: the margin rules were phased in over a six-year period. Under current SEC rules, everyone would come into scope at once in a very compressed time frame. We think this is extremely unrealistic.</p>
<p>Alongside these operational challenges, some regulatory and capital issues need to be resolved to ensure Treasury clearing can proceed smoothly, without hurting market depth and liquidity.</p>
<p>The treatment of cross-product netting is one. FICC and CME Group offer cross-margining at the clearing-member level to enable initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of cash, repo and futures transactions. But there&rsquo;s no recognition in the US capital framework for corresponding cross-netting across derivatives and repo trades. Unless this is resolved, it will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing.</p>
<p>ISDA has been exploring this issue in partnership with FIA, and we&rsquo;ll continue to emphasize the need for improved recognition of cross-product netting in the US capital framework.</p>
<p>Another issue is the US supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which acts as a non-risk-sensitive binding constraint on banks that can impede their ability to act as intermediaries, including their capacity to offer client clearing</p>
<p>Last year, ISDA wrote to US prudential regulators to make the case for targeted reforms to the SLR framework to remove impediments for banks to participate in the US Treasury market. We would welcome an industry consultation to determine the best way forward, and we were pleased to hear Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell acknowledge in testimony to the House Committee on Financial Services earlier this month that changes are necessary.</p>
<p>A third issue is continued uncertainty about the final shape of the US Basel III endgame rules and the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Based on analysis conducted by ISDA and SIFMA last year, these two sets of proposals would increase capital for client clearing businesses at US G-SIBs by an astonishing 80%. This is an unnecessary tax on clearing that is out of proportion with risk and would bring the economic viability of client clearing businesses into question.</p>
<p>These regulatory issues must be ironed out before the introduction of Treasury clearing to maintain deep, liquid markets and ensure the continued smooth functioning and resilience of the US Treasury market. Having legal and operational certainty on pending implementation issues, as well as clarity on the related capital treatment, is a fundamental prerequisite for any successful US Treasury clearing mandate. This will take time, and time is running out.</p>
<p>Mandatory clearing is going to be a transformational change for the US Treasury market. But there are no short cuts. Given all the issues that still need to be resolved, we joined other trade associations earlier this year to call for at least a one-year delay in the implementation deadlines.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, this is a topic of global importance and events like these will be critical in raising awareness and thrashing out the key issues. We&rsquo;re fortunate to have a great panel of experts to unpack the issues, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing their insights on this important topic.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>The EBA Consults To Amend Data Collection For The 2026 Benchmarking Exercise</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-to-amend-data-collection-for-the-2026-benchmarking-exercise-2025225/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a consultation to amend the Implementing Regulation on the benchmarking of credit risk, market risk and IFRS9 models for the 2026 exercise. The most significant changes, in the market risk framework, are the new templates for the collection of the alternative internal model approach (AIMA) risk measures under the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) and the extension of the scope of the exercise to banks that apply solely the Alternative Standardised Approach (ASA) methodology. For the credit risk framework only minor changes are being proposed. This consultation runs&nbsp;until 26 May 2025.</span></p>
<p>The EBA benchmarking exercise is the basis for both the supervisory assessment and the horizontal analysis of the outcome of internal models. It ensures consistent monitoring of the variability of own funds requirements resulting from the application of internal models as well as of the impact of the several different supervisory and regulatory measures, which influence the capital requirements and solvency ratios in the EU. In this regard, this consultation paper updates the information to be collected in the 2026 exercise.</p>
<p>The changes will be substantial for the market risk part. Besides the new templates and instructions for collecting the AIMA FRTB risk measures (expected shortfall, default risk charge, and stress scenario risk measure),&nbsp; the scope of the exercise will be extended to banks that apply solely the ASA methodology. This extension is a direct application of the revised wording of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD VI) and has a massive impact on the number of banks participating in the market risk assessment. In this regard, the FRTB ASA data collection was already developed in the past exercises, so the amendments to the framework of the exercise are less extensive.</p>
<p>As regards the credit risk benchmarking, the amendments to the ITS will provide a mapping between the asset classes used for the definition of the benchmarking portfolios and the breakdown of Credit Risk IRB templates adopted in the revised ITS on supervisory reporting, in line with changes in the regulatory framework related to the new Banking Package (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR3, and CRD6).</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Responses to the consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published after the consultation closes, unless requested otherwise. The deadline for the submission of comments is 26 May 2025</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-consultation-paper-draft-its-benchmarking-internal-models-exercise-2026" title="Public Hearing on Consultation Paper on draft ITS on Benchmarking Internal Models &ndash; Exercise 2026">public hearing</a>&nbsp;on this consultation will take place on 10 April 2025 from 14:00 to 15:30 CEST. Deadline for registration is 8 April 2025 at 16:00 CEST.</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>This draft ITS have been developed in accordance with article 78 of the CRD, which requires the EBA to specify the benchmarking portfolios, templates and definitions to be used as part of the annual benchmarking exercises. These are used by competent authorities to conduct an annual assessment of the quality of internal approaches used for the calculation of own funds requirements.</p>

<title>Eurex Clearing: The Role Of Central Counterparties In A DLT Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The digital transformation of the financial industry is now a reality. Emerging technologies offer opportunities for innovation and efficiency but require a suitable legal and regulatory framework. There is ongoing debate about the roles of financial market infrastructures like Central Counterparties (CCPs) and whether new and existing market entrants can provide complementary alternatives.</p>
<p>Eurex Clearing and Linklaters discuss in a whitepaper a smooth transition to a digital ecosystem from a practical perspective by focusing on topics related to clearing and settlement that are essential for this transition including the role of CCPs. We present our view on the implications and benefits of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with a focus on key aspects such as instant settlement and efficiency of netting in a clearing environment.</p>
<p>The insights and conclusions presented in this whitepaper are derived from direct experiences in operating under live conditions, rather than theoretical environments, providing a grounded and realistic view of the challenges and opportunities of a DLT financial ecosystem.</p>

<p>"We are pleased to see such early and strong support for these new options products," said&nbsp;
Giovanni Vicioso, Global Head of&nbsp;<span>Cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;Products at&nbsp;CME Group. "These smaller sized, cash-settled contracts, with expiries available every day of the business week, will provide traders with even greater precision to manage short-term&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;price risk."</p>
<p>"We are pleased to support CME Group's new options on&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures by executing the first option block trade," said&nbsp;
Roman Makarov, Head of Options Trading at Cumberland DRW. "Innovative products like this give users increased liquidity, flexibility and optionality to engage in the rapidly expanding intersection between traditional and&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;markets. It's exciting to see trusted exchanges like&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;continue to support this ecosystem through relevant product launches, and Cumberland DRW is proud to be a longstanding partner in that journey."</p>
<p>"Marex is thrilled to have cleared the first block trade for CME Group's new options on&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures for two FCM clients," said&nbsp;

<p>"CME Group's introduction of options on&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday Futures is a valuable expansion of their product suite," said&nbsp;
Mike Harvey, Head of Franchise Trading at Galaxy. "The contracts' low notional value makes them accessible to a broad range of market participants, while the&nbsp;4 p.m.&nbsp;New York&nbsp;settlement time offers added precision for developing and executing trading strategies."</p>

<title>RM131-Million Fund Launched To Support SMEs And Mid-Tier Companies In Strategic NIMP Sectors, 25 February 2025 (Tuesday), Securities Commission Malaysia</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rm131-million-fund-launched-to-support-smes-and-mid-tier-companies-in-strategic-2025225/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rm131-million-fund-launched-to-support-smes-and-mid-tier-companies-in-strategic-2025225/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) have jointly launched the Strategic Co-Investment Fund (CoSIF) under the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) today. With an initial allocation of RM131.5 million, CoSIF will be distributed through Equity Crowdfunding (ECF) and Peer-to-Peer Financing (P2P) platforms to support the growth of local Small, and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and mid-tier companies (MTCs) in strategic sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoSIF was launched by the Minister of Investment, Trade, and Industry, YB Senator Tengku Datuk Seri Utama Zafrul Aziz, together with SC Chairman, Dato' Mohammad Faiz Azmi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoSIF is a public-private co-investment scheme where the Government co-invests at predetermined ratios alongside private investors in businesses operating across the 21 sectors outlined in NIMP 2030, along with four emerging growth sectors i.e., Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), Electric Vehicles (EV), Renewable Energy (RE), and Advanced Materials. CoSIF will be administered by the SC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoSIF is designed as a blended financing model to tap into unconventional sources of funding. By tapping into the capital market, CoSIF is able to mobilise significant resources to fund high-impact projects in strategic areas such as advanced manufacturing, digitalisation and decarbonisation. This initiative is expected to drive innovation, enhance competitiveness, and foster sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This focus on SMEs and mid-tier companies as funding recipients reflects the NIMP2030&rsquo;s focus on inclusivity, and hence, is vital to the realisation of NIMP2030 objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YB Senator Tengku Datuk Seri Utama Zafrul Aziz, Minister of Investment, Trade, and Industry, added: &ldquo;The CoSIF fund exemplifies our commitment to financing SME and midtier companies, to support their growth, innovation and long-term resilience. This initiative not only diversifies our financing options but also reflects our commitment to inclusivity by facilitating broad-based growth in our industry. We are proud to unveil this innovative fund as an integral part of realizing NIMP 2030&rsquo;s missions, which places us on a better footing to continue positioning Malaysia as a premier manufacturing and services hub in the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz in his opening remarks today said, &ldquo;The deployment of the NIMP CoSIF through ECF and P2P platforms aligns with the SC's effort to democratise capital market financing access for MSMEs and MTCs, a segment which has been largely underserved. This structured public-private co-investment mechanism aims to support the fundraising journey of these businesses, fostering a capital market that is more inclusive.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC&rsquo;s Catalysing MSME and MTC Access to the Capital Market: 5-Year Roadmap (2024 &ndash; 2028) (&ldquo;Roadmap&rdquo;) was launched in May 2024. The vision of the Roadmap is to address the financing gap for MSMEs and MTCs via the capital market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Roadmap, the SC also released a Capital Market Starter Pack and a Simplified Pitching Guide (Guide). The Guide was developed in collaboration with 1,337 Ventures to help businesses communicate their business proposition and growth story to prospective investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list of ECF and P2P operators for the NIMP CoSIF will be announced before the end of March 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is reviewing free float requirements for new listings to enhance its attractiveness as a listing venue for large corporations. The proposed amendments aim to provide greater clarity and strengthen the Thai capital market's global competitiveness, aligning with SET's strategic goals of unlocking growth opportunities and solidifying its position as a premier listing hub for flagship domestic and international businesses.</p>
<p>SET is therefore seeking feedback on the following proposed <b>amendments to</b> <b>free-float requirements for new listings on SET and mai</b>:<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Revision: Free float requirements for new listings of companies with paid-up capital of THB 10 billion or higher are revised as follows:
<ul>
<li>Reduction of minimum free float from 20 percent to 17 percent of paid-up capital</li>
<li>Revocation of free float distribution grace period </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduction: Where companies to be listed on SET and mai undertake any acts that will cause their free float distribution to fall below the thresholds stipulated by the listing regulations soon after listing on the Exchange, such companies shall be deemed non-compliant with the free float qualifications according to the listing criteria. This new provision aims to prevent circumvention of listing regulations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The current listing maintenance criteria will be unchanged, requiring listed companies to maintain at least 150 minority shareholders collectively holding not less than 15 percent of paid-up capital.</p>
<p>The public consultation aims to obtain valuable opinions from stakeholders on the proposed amendments to the criteria as mentioned above. The consultation document and details are available on the SET website at&nbsp;www.set.or.th/en/rules-regulations/market-consultation&nbsp;under <b>"Proposed Amendments to Free Float Requirements for New Listings of Large Corporations on SET and mai".</b> Please share your feedback via the link <a href="https://forms.gle/6gre4xMu4qE9cgZx5">https://forms.gle/6gre4xMu4qE9cgZx5</a> &nbsp;by March 18, 2025.</p>

<title>ASIC Makes New Clearing And Settlement Rules To Promote Competition</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-makes-new-clearing-and-settlement-rules-to-promote-competition-2025225/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-makes-new-clearing-and-settlement-rules-to-promote-competition-2025225/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has used new powers to promote competitive outcomes in clearing and settlement (CS) by requiring the ASX to provide its CS services on a transparent and fair basis, with a requirement to publish a comparison of fees against international providers.</p>
<p>This marks the first time ASIC has exercised its new powers under the Competition in Clearing and Settlement (CiCS) services reforms passed in September 2023 and enlivened by the Minister in May 2024.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the new rules supported the agency&rsquo;s goal to promote strong and innovative development of the financial system.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is about limiting ASX&rsquo;s ability to misuse its monopoly power to deter new entrants,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The new rules support the long-term confident and informed participation of investors in Australian financial markets by establishing clear obligations to promote competitive outcomes in the provision of clearing and settlement services.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clear and benchmarked pricing structure is intended to reduce competitive barriers to entry for entities unaffiliated with the ASX.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a key step in ensuring Australians have a fair, strong and efficient financial system.</p>
<p>&lsquo;More broadly, ASIC is actively looking at the regulatory settings for our markets and will release a discussion paper this week on the subject. These new rules demonstrate our commitment to acting where we see it is necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with these new rules, ASX must ensure its clearing and settlement services are offered in a transparent, non-discriminatory way.</p>
<p>The ASX will have to take all reasonable steps to:</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The CiCS reforms that passed the Parliament in September 2023 and the May 2024 Corporations and Competition (CS Services) Instrument 2024 provided ASIC with rule-making powers in respect of ASX&rsquo;s cash equity CS facilities.</p>
<p>The CiCS reforms were the culmination of extensive review and industry consultation by the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) and the ACCC on the implications of competition in CS of cash equities in Australia, and calls from regulators for more powers. In 2017, the CFR published regulatory expectations for conduct in operating cash equity clearing and settlement services in Australia (Regulatory Expectations), which we have implemented as enforceable obligations in our CS Services Rules. We have also supplemented the Regulatory Expectations with requirements on technical interoperability, management of intragroup conflicts of interest, and external assurances on pricing and barriers to competition.</p>
<p>ASIC and the RBA are co-regulators of licensed CS facilities.</p>
<p>The RBA and ASIC have supervisory responsibilities for the four CS facilities in the ASX Group: two central counterparties &ndash; ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Clear (Futures) Pty Ltd &ndash; and two securities settlement facilities &ndash; ASX Settlement Pty Ltd and Austraclear Limited. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L00162/asmade/text"><em>ASIC CS Services Rules 2025</em></a>&nbsp;will apply to these subsidiaries and other ASX Group entities.</p>

<title>Launch Of Using CONNEQTOR In “Tokai Tokyo Discretionary Investment Management Service” Provided By Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., Ltd.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (&ldquo;TSE&rdquo;) is pleased to announce that Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;Tokai Tokyo Securities&rdquo;) will start using the RFQ (Request For Quote) platform CONNEQTOR, a service provided by TSE to improve the liquidity of the ETF market, for its &ldquo;Tokai Tokyo Discretionary Investment Management Service&rdquo; (&ldquo;Discretionary Investment Management Service&rdquo;), which Tokai Tokyo Securities started offering in January 2024.</p>
<p>Originally, CONNEQTOR is used directly by institutional investors and provided a mechanism for brokers to use it on behalf of investors, and these are designed to meet the needs of institutional investors who execute large-lot and other difficult transactions. On the other hand, some individual investors have the same needs for large-lot executions as institutional investors, and more sophisticated execution services have been required for the asset management of individual investors as well.</p>
<p>Discretionary Investment Management Service provided by Tokai Tokyo Securities is a service whereby individuals and other investors are entrusted with the management of their assets under a discretionary investment management contract, and Tokai Tokyo Securities investment managers trade on behalf of the investors. By utilizing CONNEQTOR on ETF trading, as well as on screen, even non-professional investors, including individuals, can now enjoy the same sophisticated asset management as institutional investors.</p>
<p>This initiative is a new service born out of Tokai Tokyo Securities' pursuit of best execution to maximize client profits to fulfill its fiduciary duty, and TSE believes it will help realize the CONNEQTOR project's goal of creating &ldquo;an environment where a wide range of ETF investors can trade ETFs faster and better priced&rdquo;.</p>
<p>TSE will support the use of CONNEQTOR for Discretionary Investment Management Service provided by Tokai Tokyo Securities and will continue its efforts to provide and develop a smooth and convenient market environment.</p>

<title>The EBA Finds Progress In Availability And Accessibility Of Data Used To Identify And Qualify Environmental, Social And Governance Risks But Data Landscape Remains Incomplete</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report assessing&nbsp;the availability and accessibility of data related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks as well as the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology for identifying and qualifying credit exposures to such risks. The Report finds that while there have been significant improvements over the recent years on availability and accessibility of data, the ESG data landscape remains incomplete at this stage. Key policy initiatives such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the supporting European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), as well as further transparency in the methodologies of ESG scores and&nbsp;External&nbsp;Credit&nbsp;Assessment Institutions&rsquo;&nbsp;(ECAI) credit risk ratings, are expected to further improve this landscape and mitigate challenges.</span></p>
<p>Credit institutions are increasingly assessing ESG risks, although progress differs across exposure classes. Data availability, quality and granularity remain among the most significant challenges in developing more advanced approaches.</p>
<p>Methodologies&nbsp;are most mature in the assessment of transition risk in corporate portfolios, where the EBA has observed certain elements of standardisation, such as the use of sectoral classification, greenhouse gas emissions and transition plans of counterparties as the key sources of information.</p>
<p>Similarly, the EBA has observed some degree of standardisation in methodologies for mortgage exposures, which are typically based on the geographical location and energy efficiency of the immovable property collateral.</p>
<p>The methodologies are less mature for other exposure classes where the process of developing relevant methodologies to identify and assess ESG risks is still ongoing. The practices regarding the assessment of environmental risk other than climate, social and governance risks are still at an early stage and mostly qualitative.</p>
<p>While there are emerging practices regarding the assessment of ESG risks, the progress to date on the assessment of how these risks affect the level of credit risk is limited. At this stage, only few institutions apply specific methods for measuring credit risk related to ESG factors, focusing mostly on climate risk. While governance aspects have traditionally been part of the assessment of credit risk, both by institutions and by ECAIs, there is little standardisation and the approaches are mainly qualitative, often based on expert judgement.</p>
<p>Based on the market practices and the current data landscape, the EBA concludes that the feasibility of designing a standardised methodology differs greatly depending on the type of exposures and risks considered. While there have been developments in the identification and assessment of ESG risks, there is still insufficient understanding and evidence of their effective impact on credit risk parameters. Should regulatory efforts towards standardisation be pursued, a sequenced approach would most likely be necessary.</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>The EBA is mandated under letters (a) and (b) of Article 501c(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, i.e. the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), to assess:</p>
<p>a) the availability and accessibility of reliable and consistent ESG data for credit risk exposure classes;</p>
<p>b) the feasibility of introducing a standardised methodology to identify and qualify these exposures, based on a common set of principles to ESG risk classification, and using the information available from sustainability disclosure frameworks, the guidance and conclusions coming from supervisory stress-testing or scenario analysis of climate-related financial risks, and the relevant ESG score of the credit risk rating by a nominated ECAI.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Florida Bar’s 41st Annual Federal Securities Institute And M&amp;A Conference, Mark T. Uyeda, SEC Acting Chairman</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Greg [Yadley], for that introduction and also for your past contributions to the Commission as a member and officer of our Advisory Committee on Small Business Capital Formation as well as its predecessor advisory committee on small and emerging companies.&nbsp; In total, you served nearly ten years on these committees.&nbsp; The Commission, investors, entrepreneurs, and smaller public companies have all benefited from your participation and insight.</p>
<p>I am pleased to deliver the R. Franklin Balotti Keynote Address at this year&rsquo;s [Federal Securities Institute and M&amp;A] Conference.&nbsp; Frank&rsquo;s reputation as one of the leading experts of Delaware corporate law cannot be understated.&nbsp; His treatise,&nbsp;<i>The Delaware Law of Corporations and Business Organizations</i>, co-written with Jesse Finkelstein, was a necessary resource to corporate lawyers.&nbsp; As a law firm associate, I found myself frequently consulting his treatise to advise clients on Delaware corporate law.</p>
<p>Frank was also not a stranger to the Commission.&nbsp; In fact, I had the opportunity to learn firsthand from Frank.&nbsp; It was May 2007, shortly after I joined the Commission the prior year as counsel to then-Commissioner Paul Atkins, where I advised him on, among other subjects, matters relating to the Division of Corporation Finance (&ldquo;Corp Fin&rdquo;). &nbsp;Frank was part of a Commission roundtable on the Federal Proxy Rules and State Corporation Law that was moderated by the then-Corp Fin Director, and current Co-Chair of this Conference, John White, along with the late Marty Dunn.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During that roundtable, Frank observed that a company should be required to pay for the solicitation of a shareholder proposal only if the proposal &ldquo;relates to the economic well being of the enterprise.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; The roundtable on which Frank participated was the first of three roundtables organized by then-Chairman Chris Cox on shareholder proposals and the proxy process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, it goes to show that the topic of shareholder proxies and proposals is one that is long-standing and not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14M<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;was published to address various concerns that had been received over the past several years &mdash; a period in which there was substantial deviation from the staff&rsquo;s traditional approach in evaluating shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Rather than discussing shareholder proposals, however, my remarks today will focus on the Commission&rsquo;s role in fostering innovation, job creation, and economic growth, by maintaining cost-effective regulations for every stage of a company&rsquo;s lifecycle.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<h2>A New Beginning</h2>
<p>But first, I want to highlight the accomplishments of the Commission and its staff since the start of the new Administration.&nbsp; My first priority is to return normalcy to the Commission.&nbsp; I have been at the Commission for nearly 19 years, under presidents from both political parties.&nbsp; What occurred under the Biden Administration was a stark aberration from longstanding norms as to what the Commission has historically viewed its legal authority, policy priorities, and use of enforcement.</p>
<p>Over the past five weeks, the Commission has begun the process of returning to its narrow mission to facilitate capital formation, while protecting investors and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets.&nbsp; One purpose of the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory mandate is to create capital markets that facilitate the competitiveness and ingenuity of American industry.&nbsp; Properly implemented, we can help President Trump achieve his goal of a new golden age of economic growth and innovation, creating more jobs, wealth, and prosperity for all Americans.</p>
<p>In addition to removing Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14L,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;the Commission staff also rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;which had effectively prevented banks and broker-dealers from taking custody of crypto assets. &nbsp;Regarding the Commission&rsquo;s regulation of crypto assets generally, I have designated Commissioner Hester Peirce to lead a crypto task force that will seek to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework to provide realistic paths to registration and to craft sensible disclosure frameworks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Under the prior Administration, the Commission adopted a climate-related disclosure rule,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;which is currently being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; I have begun the process to allow the Commission to deliberate the appropriate next steps for the litigation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp; During the adoption of that rule, I expressed my concerns regarding the Commission&rsquo;s lack of statutory authority, shortcomings in the rulemaking process, and the potential harm that the rule could inflict on our capital markets and economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>In response to potential cybersecurity concerns raised by market participants and others, the Commission has also exempted certain personally identifiable information from being collected by the Consolidated Audit Trail (&ldquo;CAT&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; This change brings the CAT closer to the Commission&rsquo;s original vision of having a system that can explain trading activity during market anomalies, rather than being an omnipresent surveillance systems tracking everyone&rsquo;s individual movements.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement work has not stopped.&nbsp; The agency continues to bring charges for insider trading,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;inflating financial performance,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;among other topics.</p>
<h2>Improving Capital-Raising Opportunities for Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>Turning to the main topic for my remarks today, how can the Commission foster innovation, job creation, and growth in the U.S. economy?&nbsp; It starts with practical and cost-effective regulations that entrepreneurs who are just starting their businesses can rely on to raise the capital needed to fund their ideas.</p>
<p>In 2012, the JOBS Act introduced the concept of crowdfunding into the federal securities laws,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;and in 2015, the Commission adopted Regulation Crowdfunding (&ldquo;Regulation CF&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; I worked on both the proposing and adopting releases for Regulation CF.&nbsp; Almost ten years later, has Regulation CF achieved its intended goal of &ldquo;provid[ing] startups and small businesses with capital by making relatively low dollar offerings of securities&hellip;less costly&rdquo;?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, the answer is &ldquo;probably not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the availability of Regulation CF, along with other rules available to entrepreneurs to raise capital without registration, 77% of small business owners reported being concerned about their ability to access capital.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp; Accordingly, it is not surprising that for the past three years, the Commission&rsquo;s Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation has recommended &ldquo;targeted regulatory changes&rdquo; to the exempt offerings regime, including Regulation CF.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Commission&rsquo;s prior leadership did not act on these recommendations.&nbsp; To ensure that entrepreneurs have access to the capital needed to fund their ideas and grow their startups, I have requested Commission staff to begin the process of exploring ways to implement these recommendations.</p>
<p>The changes can take several forms, and some proposals may require legislative action to amend the governing statutes.&nbsp; However, when crafting regulations that are intended to be relied upon by startup companies, the Commission should follow a guiding principle &ndash; the regulations must be relatively straightforward to comply with and not impose a disproportionate amount of compliance costs, while still providing appropriate investor protection.&nbsp; A company relying on Regulation CF to raise $5 million may need to pay over $500,000 in fees to the funding portal, lawyers, and accountants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp; Should more than 10% of the funds raised by an entrepreneur who may still be working out of his garage go towards paying compliance and legal fees?&nbsp; Or is a portion of that money better spent executing the business plan to build a product or provide a service?</p>
<p>Complex regulations increase transaction costs.&nbsp; Many entrepreneurs have raised concerns about the complexity of the Commission&rsquo;s current regulatory regime for exempt offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp; Paying operating expenses, such as legal and compliance fees, was one of the top three financial challenges facing early-stage companies, and running out of cash was one of the top two reasons that startups fail.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp; To help alleviate these challenges facing entrepreneurs, the Commission should aim to reduce the complexity of its exempt offering regulations and their associated compliance costs.</p>
<h2>Empowering Retail Investment in Private Companies</h2>
<p>Conversations regarding the Commission&rsquo;s exempt offering regulations usually have two aspects.&nbsp; First, is how to enable private companies to obtain more capital through cost-effective means.&nbsp; Second, is how to enable more retail investors to place their capital into private companies.</p>
<p>Discussions of this second aspect has largely focused on the accredited investor definition.&nbsp; The concept of accredited investor anchors rules 506(b) and 506(c) in Regulation D.&nbsp; Pursuant to rule 506(b), sales to non-accredited investors require the issuer to prepare additional disclosure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp; It is therefore not surprising that 96% of rule 506(b) offerings excluded non-accredited investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp; Pursuant to rule 506(c), sales can be made only to accredited investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p>In other offering exemptions, the accredited investor concept also plays a role.&nbsp; Under rule 504, general solicitation is permitted if sales are made only to accredited investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Regulation CF and Regulation A Tier 2, non-accredited investors are limited as to their securities purchases, while there are no limitations for purchasers who are accredited investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, qualifying as an accredited investor can serve as a gateway for individuals to invest in private companies.&nbsp; Most commentators seem to agree that the current income and net worth thresholds for an individual to qualify as an accredited investor<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;either need to be changed or are insufficient.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp; Some call for the thresholds to be indexed to inflation, either from 1982 levels<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;or only on a going-forward basis.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp; Others call for non-financial ways to qualify &ndash; either in addition to or in lieu of the income and net worth tests &ndash; such as qualitative professional criteria<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;or certifications,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;completion of an educational program,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;or an investor test.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>
<p>In exploring ways to allow for greater retail investing in private companies, any changes to the accredited investor definition should be considered together with how companies are likely to accept investments from individuals &ndash; directly or through pooled investment vehicles.&nbsp; If the latter, then consideration should also be given to changes under the Investment Company Act that would permit more retail investors to invest through private funds.</p>
<p>Another consideration is whether the &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; approach of the accredited investor definition is appropriate.&nbsp; If an individual does not qualify as an accredited investor, even under an expanded definition, should he or she not be able to have any exposure to private offerings?&nbsp; Or should the Commission&rsquo;s exempt offering regime use a sliding scale approach and allow any individual to invest at least a small amount in private companies over the course of a year?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp; This issue is worthy of further consideration.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></p>
<p>In advocating for a policy goal of empowering retail investment in private companies, it is not lost on me that most startup companies fail and return nothing to their investors.&nbsp; However, investments in private, growth-stage companies that are higher-risk, higher-reward may be beneficial as part of a person&rsquo;s diversified portfolio, particularly if the exposure itself is through pooled investment vehicles. &nbsp;If an individual believes that the risk is appropriate and is protected against fraud, then our regulatory regime should not deny such individual a source of potential wealth accumulation and portfolio diversification.&nbsp; Investor protection cannot be achieved through paternalistic policies.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I have directed the Commission staff to explore regulatory changes that enable greater retail investor participation in the private markets, whether through modifications to the accredited investor definition or otherwise, while continuing to ensure that those investors are protected against fraud and bad actors.</p>
<h2>Making IPOs Attractive Again</h2>
<p>Whether a retail or institutional investor places their money into a private company, they likely share the same financial goal for their investment &ndash; ultimately attaining liquidity for the investment and achieving a return.&nbsp; Typically, companies have provided this liquidity through a sale of the company or an initial public offering (&ldquo;IPO&rdquo;).&nbsp; In the past three and one-half years, increased antitrust enforcement has reduced sales of startups to larger companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp; Additionally, over the past twenty-plus years, the number of IPOs has drastically declined.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>
<p>As entrepreneurs grow businesses past the startup stage, they will likely require capital from institutional investors, such as venture capital funds.&nbsp; Without attractive opportunities for the company to sell itself or become publicly traded, what incentive does a venture fund have to make an investment?&nbsp; While I have to defer to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on antitrust enforcement, there are things that the Commission can do to help make IPOs attractive again.</p>
<p>One of the more innovative regulatory changes during the past fifteen years was the JOBS Act&rsquo;s creation of emerging growth companies (&ldquo;EGCs&rdquo;) and the concept of an on-ramp for compliance with disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, over the past few years, the Commission failed to provide any relief for EGCs to use this on-ramp in several adopted rules, including cybersecurity disclosure,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>&nbsp;amendments to rule 10b5-1,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>&nbsp;and clawbacks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a>&nbsp; Additionally, for the stayed climate-related disclosure rule, the Commission provided only limited relief for EGCs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a></p>
<p>Appropriately tailoring the Commission&rsquo;s wide-reaching disclosure requirements for newly public companies may, on the margin, incentivize more companies to go public.&nbsp; In turn, venture funds may see more attractive exit opportunities for their investments and decide to provide funding.&nbsp; This funding would then enable companies to execute their business plan, create jobs, and contribute to economic growth.</p>
<p>With a view towards achieving these goals, I have asked the Commission staff to review the EGC definition and recommend potential changes, including how a company qualifies and the duration for which it retains the status.&nbsp; As part of its review, I have also requested the Commission staff to consider how EGCs could benefit from having an on-ramp to comply with certain existing disclosure obligations.</p>
<h2>Scaling Public Company Disclosure Requirements</h2>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s role in fostering economic growth does not end with the company&rsquo;s IPO.&nbsp; Public companies continue to compete for capital and resources to fund product development, market expansion, and new lines of business.&nbsp; The Commission&rsquo;s rules governing disclosure obligations should consider a company&rsquo;s size and resources so that smaller companies are not disproportionately burdened as they compete.</p>
<p>The Commission introduced scaled disclosure based on a company&rsquo;s size in 1992,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>&nbsp;and it was an innovative creation at the time. &nbsp;However, the Commission&rsquo;s current rules with respect to filer categories and associated disclosure obligations are needlessly complex and do not provide sufficient scaled disclosure benefits.&nbsp; As an example, a company with a $250&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">million</span>&nbsp;public float is subject to the same disclosure requirements as a company with a $250&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">billion</span>&nbsp;public float.</p>
<p>This outcome results from the fact that the Commission has not changed its thresholds for a company to qualify as a large accelerated filer or accelerated filer since they were established in 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>&nbsp; At the time, approximately 18% of reporting companies had a public float of at least $700 million and qualified as a large accelerated filer, while 23% of companies had a public float between $75 million and $700 million and qualified as an accelerated filer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>&nbsp; Today, the percentage of large accelerated filers has doubled &ndash; to 36% - while the percentage of accelerated filers has declined to 7%.<a name="_Ref191028693"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>&nbsp; Besides not updating the qualification thresholds, the Commission also has not sufficiently scaled the disclosure requirements between the two&nbsp; categories.&nbsp; Currently, only one requirement differentiates large accelerated filers &ndash; the 60 day deadline for filing Form 10-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></p>
<p>Besides the staleness of the thresholds to qualify as large accelerated filer and accelerated filer, the relationship between those categories and the smaller reporting company definition can also overlap, thereby increasing complexity and compliance costs.&nbsp; As Commissioner Peirce has highlighted, &ldquo;even we at the SEC need diagrams to figure&hellip;out [the overlapping definitions].&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></p>
<p>Depending on a company&rsquo;s public float and revenue, it can qualify as both a smaller reporting company and either an accelerated filer or a non-accelerated filer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a>&nbsp; This distinction has real-world cost implications as non-accelerated filers do not need to provide an auditor attestation of the company&rsquo;s evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a>&nbsp; Does it make sense that some smaller reporting companies<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a>&nbsp;need to continue to pay for this annual attestation?&nbsp; When the Commission last had the opportunity to address this issue in March 2020, Commissioner Peirce lamented that she &ldquo;continue[d] to be disappointed that [the Commission] ha[s] not fully re-aligned the [smaller reporting company] and non-accelerated filer definitions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a></p>
<p>Outdated financial thresholds, lack of scaling, and overlapping definitions can result in a complex and ineffective regulatory regime, imposing unnecessary costs on companies and their shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a>&nbsp; Accordingly, the Commission should be considering whether to re-align the Commission&rsquo;s filer categories to reflect the size and makeup of public companies today.&nbsp; Following any potential re-alignment, the Commission should also review its disclosure requirements and identify rules that should apply only to the largest companies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the Chairman&rsquo;s suite at SEC headquarters, there is a frame containing securities certificates issued by Sears, Roebuck and Co. &nbsp;At one point in time, it was the dominant retailer in America.&nbsp; Our capital markets regulatory system, however, provided opportunities for new competitors, such as Amazon in the 1990s,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-florida-bar-022425?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a>&nbsp;to obtain financing and enter the market.&nbsp; As we head into an era of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other new technologies, there will be companies that race to build business models around these innovations.&nbsp; These companies, whether they are the size of Amazon in 1994 or 2025, or any time in between, will require capital at every stage of their lifecycle to innovate, hire, and grow.&nbsp; The Commission will need to have cost-effective regulations in place if we expect these developments to occur in America and not abroad.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time this morning.</p>

<title>CME Group And DTCC To Enhance Existing Cross-Margining Arrangement, Extending Benefits To End Users In December 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cme-group-and-dtcc-to-enhance-existing-cross-margining-arrangement-extending-be-2025224/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cme-group-and-dtcc-to-enhance-existing-cross-margining-arrangement-extending-be-2025224/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, and&nbsp;The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation&nbsp;(DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today confirmed plans to expand their existing cross-margining arrangement to provide increased margin savings and capital efficiencies to end users by&nbsp;December 2025.</p>
<p>Subject to regulatory approval, this proposed enhancement to the long-standing CME-DTCC cross-margining arrangement will allow eligible end user clients at&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;and the Government Securities Division (GSD) of&nbsp;DTCC's Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&nbsp;(FICC) to access capital efficiencies that are available when trading&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;securities and&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;interest rate futures that have offsetting risk exposures. To participate in end-user cross margining, clients will need to leverage the same dually registered Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) and broker/dealer (as registered with the&nbsp;SEC) at both CCPs. Aligning enhanced cross-margining for end-user customers with the regulatory timeline for expanded&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Clearing requirements encourages greater utilization of central clearing, therefore reducing systemic risk.</p>
<p>"Bringing the benefits of cross-margining to the end-user is a critical step in enhancing capital efficiencies across&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;market participants," said&nbsp;
Laura Klimpel, Managing Director and Head of DTCC's Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. "Our ongoing collaboration with&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;remains focused on extending cross-margin benefits to more customer accounts and eventually, to other products. Doing so will enable even greater efficiency, cost reduction, improved liquidity and increased risk management in the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;markets."</p>
<p>"Extending our cross-margining agreement to client accounts is an important milestone in our efforts to make&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;markets more efficient for all market users," said&nbsp;
Suzanne Sprague,&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;Chief Operating Officer and Global Head of Clearing and Post-Trade Services. "Building on more than 20 years of partnership, we look forward to working with DTCC and regulators to deliver even greater benefits to both cash and futures market participants."</p>
<p>Under the proposed arrangement, FICC will designate cross-margin accounts, allowing all eligible positions in the account to offset with eligible&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;interest rate futures.&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;will allow participants to direct futures to end-user cross-margin accounts throughout the day, thereby making them available for offset in the cross-margin arrangement. Ahead of the regulatory approvals, end-users can work to set up a new account, complete proper program legal documentation and test end-to-end workflows.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Under the patronage of H.E. the Minister of Investment, Eng. Mothana Gharaibeh, the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) has announced the launch of the Climate Disclosure Regulatory Framework in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, in partnership with the Kingdom of the Netherlands.&nbsp; This initiative aims to enhance the disclosure of climate-related information by listed companies, as part of ASE&rsquo;s efforts to implement the latest sustainability standards across its three pillars: environmental, social responsibility, and governance (ESG). The initiative comes in response to the increasing demand from investors and investment funds for such disclosures in line with the latest international standards and best practices. This achievement is the first of its kind in the Middle East and aligns with Jordan&rsquo;s Economic Modernization Vision, enhancing transparency, sustainability, and disclosure. It also enhances investor&rsquo;s confidence in the national economy and capital market while increasing its competitiveness.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of this initiative, ASE, in collaboration with IFC, has developed a guidance manual for companies on how to disclose climate-related issues and a policy outlining the rationale and requirements for climate disclosure. This guidance aligns with global best practices, particularly the sustainability disclosure standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), specifically the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) S2, and the relevant climate-related requirements under IFRS S1.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The guidance includes a set of standards and principles designed to assist companies listed on the ASE in preparing climate-related financial and non-financial disclosures, including climate-related risks, opportunities, and their impact on operational activities, in line with IFRS standards. The guidance aims to enhance investors&rsquo; confidence by ensuring the comparability of climate disclosures and enhancing companies' ability to address environmental challenges.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Minister of Investment, Engineer Muthanna Gharaibeh, affirmed that the launch of the regulatory framework for disclosure of climate-related information aligns with the commitment to enhancing transparency and accountability in companies listed on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), in line with the latest international sustainability standards. He emphasized that this achievement represents a pivotal step in strengthening the investment environment in the Kingdom, reflecting a commitment to applying best practices in governance, environmental, and social standards. It also enhances confidence in the national economy and Jordan&rsquo;s capital market, thereby contributing to attracting sustainable investments and helping companies adapt to climate change challenges, ultimately boosting their competitiveness both locally and internationally.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Minister Gharaibeh also praised the support of the Dutch government and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for the Amman Stock Exchange, emphasizing that this support reinforces the implementation of the regulatory framework aimed at integrating sustainability principles into listed companies. He reiterated the Jordanian government&rsquo;s commitment to removing any obstacles that may hinder businesses, stressing that investment can only grow and thrive in the presence of a strong and efficient financial market.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The CEO of the ASE, Mazen Wathaifi, emphasized that the launch of the Climate Disclosure Regulatory Framework comes with the ASE's efforts to further enhance regulatory and technical framework at the capital market and its competitiveness, also represents a significant step toward achieving sustainable development goals and supporting companies in improving their environmental performance. Transparent, science-based disclosure contributes to enhancing companies&rsquo; competitiveness and strengthening investors&rsquo; confidence in the capital market and the national economy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wathaifi added that this milestone reflects ASE&rsquo;s commitment to promoting sustainability practices among listed companies and aims to provide a comprehensive framework that enhances resilience to climate challenges facing both the national and global economies. This initiative is part of the Exchange&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to drive innovation in the financial sector and strengthen ESG practices in the capital market to build a more sustainable future. These efforts began with the ASE joining the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (UNSSE) initiative, fostering awareness, knowledge, and expertise in this field among listed companies in collaboration with various global institutions. Subsequently, the 20 largest companies were required to publish sustainability reports starting in 2022, as a step toward expanding this requirement to all listed companies. He emphasized that applying sustainability principles and standards, along with disclosing related information, has increasingly become a key requirement for investors and investment funds worldwide.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Khawaja Aftab Ahmed, IFC Regional Director for the Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan says &ldquo;We are proud to have joined forces with the Amman Stock Exchange to develop the region&rsquo;s first Climate Disclosure Framework. This pioneering initiative can be a gamechanger for enhancing the sustainability of Jordan&rsquo;s private sector, helping listed companies become more competitive and attractive to investors, both within and outside the country, by abiding by international ESG principles and standards. It can also be critical for addressing Jordan&rsquo;s climate-related challenges and for setting an example for other countries in the region to follow suit.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mr. Pier de Vries, Deputy Ambassador of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands says &ldquo;For the Netherlands, supporting Jordan in achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth is a key priority, in line with Jordan&rsquo;s Economic Modernization Vision. We are excited that the Netherlands&rsquo; financial support and our partnership with IFC have resulted in today&rsquo;s launch of the Amman Stock Exchange&rsquo;s Climate Disclosure Regulatory Framework. This is a significant milestone. Companies that embrace climate disclosure will enhance their resilience and competitiveness, drive innovation, and underpin sustainable future growth for Jordan and beyond.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;It is worth noting that climate-related disclosures will be optional for companies listed in the ASE20 index in 2026 as of 2025 to facilitate their adaptation to the new requirements. However, these disclosures will become mandatory for these companies starting in 2027 as of 2026.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>ASE has already begun building the capacity of ASE20-listed companies regarding the regulatory framework and its requirements. This initiative aims to ensure a comprehensive understanding of how to identify climate-related opportunities, effectively mitigate climate risks, and disclose them accurately.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>ASE invites all companies, investors, and stakeholders to review the Climate Disclosure Regulatory Framework, Guidance, and Policy, to leverage the available information to enhance their climate-related reports and strategies. Interested parties can access the guidance, framework, and policy through the following link:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Saxo Sees Boom In UK Client Numbers Following New Pricing</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/saxo-sees-boom-in-uk-client-numbers-following-new-pricing-2025224/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Number of new female clients has tripled year-on-year compared to 2023.</li>
<li>Number of clients under 25 is also increasing, representing 15% of new clients in 2024, up from 9% in 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saxo, the leader in online trading and investment, today reports a significant increase in its client base following the introduction of its new pricing model, with the total number of new trading end clients across markets up 132% in 2024 compared to 2023.</p>
<p>Noticeable trends emerge when focusing on the UK market, including increases in both the number of new clients under the age of 25 &ndash; rising from 9% in 2023 to 15% in 2024 &ndash; and new female clients &ndash; which has trebled year-on-year, now representing 18% of new clients in the UK.</p>
<p><b>Commenting on the figures, Andrew Bresler, CEO of Saxo in the UK said:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;Our pricing model is indicative of our belief that our clients should have access to investment solutions that are both best-in-class and cost-effective. Seeing such robust growth in our client numbers &ndash; both in the UK and globally across our markets &ndash; is a testament to the strength of our offering and attractive pricing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The increase in new clients follows the announcement in January 2024 of significant pricing changes across many of Saxo&rsquo;s key markets. For clients in the UK, this resulted in substantial price reductions, especially when trading US stocks and home market stocks, amongst other products such as ETFs, ETPs, Listed Options and Futures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saxo clients pay a minimum of $1 commission on US trades, and &pound;3 commission on UK trades. Other changes included the removal of the custody and platform fees. Currency conversion fees were also slashed to 0.25% across all accounts.</p>
<p>New and existing clients have benefited from these prices when trading across markets and sectors throughout 2024.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our clients have access to over 70,000 instruments globally, providing them with a breadth of investment opportunities,&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><b>adds Dan Squires, CCO at Saxo in the UK<i>.</i></b><i>&nbsp;&ldquo;This also enables us to observe some interesting trends in trading and investing habits &ndash; in 2024, for instance, UK stocks were noticeably absent from the top 25 most traded instruments on our platform, with the S&amp;P 500 dominating in terms of value traded.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>FSB Chair Calls For Renewed Focus On Implementation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Under the South African G20 Presidency, the FSB is prioritising the promotion and monitoring of key reforms, with a strategic review and interim report set for delivery in 2025.</span></li>
<li><span>Implementation work also includes a peer review on implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s global regulatory framework for crypto-asset markets and activities and global stablecoin arrangements.</span></li>
<li><span>Letter outlines key issues the FSB is working on in 2025, including cross-border payments, non-bank financial intermediation, digital innovation and climate-related financial risks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/02/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-february-2025/">letter from its Chair, Klaas Knot, to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors</a>&nbsp;ahead of their meeting on 26-27 February.</p>
<p>The letter notes that shifting financial conditions and geopolitical uncertainty call for continued vigilance on financial stability. The FSB has developed extensive reforms in recent years to enhance resilience by addressing key financial system vulnerabilities. These reforms target not only safety and soundness, but also support innovation by providing clarity on policy approaches for emerging topics like crypto-assets.</p>
<p>The letter notes that with key reforms developed or nearing completion, the FSB is shifting toward a greater focus on the promotion and monitoring of implementation. This work will take a prominent role in 2025 as the FSB undertakes a strategic review of 15 years of monitoring reform implementation. The review will provide insights into the effectiveness of the monitoring of post-global financial crisis regulatory reforms and identify areas where the FSB can make improvements in the tools it uses to ensure the consistent, global implementation of agreed reforms. The FSB will deliver an interim report on this work to the G20 in October.</p>
<p>The FSB will also remain proactive in assessing financial system vulnerabilities. This includes work to address data and information gaps in non-bank financial intermediation, which have impeded the effective assessment of relevant vulnerabilities and the formulation of proportionate policy responses.</p>
<p>The letter sets out in more detail the work underway this year at the FSB and its relevance to international financial stability.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB coordinates and oversees the monitoring of the implementation of agreed financial reforms and its reporting to the G20. This includes reporting on&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/about/leading-by-example/">members&rsquo; commitments</a>&nbsp;and progress in implementing international financial standards and other policy initiatives;&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/implementation-monitoring/peer_reviews/">conducting peer reviews of FSB members</a>&nbsp;(which are an obligation of membership); and&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/implementation-monitoring/initiative-on-cooperation-and-information-exchange/">encouraging global adherence to prudential regulatory and supervisory standards</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Finds Vast Majority Of Ongoing Suitability Reviews Delivered</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has found that financial advisers are delivering suitability reviews in the vast majority of cases included in its review of ongoing advice.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Financial advisers can charge their clients for ongoing advice and related services, such as arranging transactions or managing a relationship between a retail client and discretionary investment manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA was concerned that these services may not always have been delivered where they had been offered, so asked for data from 22 of the largest financial advice firms. The review focused on delivery of suitability reviews as firms generally included these as part of their ongoing advice service.</p>
<p>The data provided by the firms showed that suitability reviews were delivered in around 83% of cases. In a further 15% of cases we were told that clients either declined or did not respond to the firm&rsquo;s offer of a review. There were fewer than 2% of cases where firms reported they had made no effort to deliver the suitability review to clients.</p>
<p>The FCA is asking all advice firms to review its findings, and to consider whether they have met their regulatory requirements and contractual obligations regarding ongoing services. If not, they should take appropriate steps to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>The rules on ongoing services were introduced more than a decade ago, during which time consumer needs and expectations, technology, and market practices have continued to change. Going forwards, the FCA will review the regulatory approach for these services.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, interim executive director of markets at the FCA, said: 'Ongoing financial advice and support can be a fantastic service and can be important in helping people make the most of their money. Relationships between advisers and customers can last many years and can take different forms.</p>
<p>'In the vast majority of the cases we looked at, firms delivered ongoing advice for their customers. But, in a small number of cases, they haven&rsquo;t attempted to provide the services they offered and customers are paying for. In those instances, they will need to put that right.</p>
<p>'The FCA will also review the rules on ongoing advice to make sure they remain fit for the future and help as many people as possible to get good support in managing their financial lives.&rsquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The venture capital (VC) funding landscape in the UK market saw year-on-year (YoY) decline in deal volume by 12.6% from January 2024 to January 2025, with the number of deals dropping from 87 to 76. Despite this decrease in deal volume, the total funding value increased significantly by 43.5% from $863.2 million in January 2024 to $1.2 billion in January 2025, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyI46DndO6wveoWg-2FCWKH6nQ5rj-2FwHu04zxa6MFjJRsMjr-2BRtW4OUe875wa-2B91MtOxXetgL_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CtfdQFPy6Vf7aJ3zhnJy0r4YTfEFDZDQswjIH3ip6RLPEsGSWuax5CFvbg-2BguleExm2fDafb6BfpWr4EzfLNXb66S2v6okAzE5ridhm1L-2FHDkNlZZVKJL0tN7MLGQus0tl9w4zCeUbJ4tqjMT2nLX7Q5ytKy5FRWr-2FaPTo2v5mHqrOApCTjEk6O2n5WTsA9E9OkvAWRiXrEbo1333Ckicbz6rETdfUeOmxWYxZs-2BPaQw-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The notable rise in total funding value, despite a decline in deal volume, highlights a shift towards larger investments in the UK market. Furthermore, the UK has upheld its position as a prominent market in the global venture capital funding landscape.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

The UK accounted for 5.8% share of the total number of VC deals announced globally during January 2025 while its share of the corresponding funding value stood at 5%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in the UK during January 2025 include $411 million fundraising by Verdiva Bio, $180 million funding in Synthesia, and $55 million worth fundraising by Lindus Health, among others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;The shift towards larger and more targeted investments signals that the UK VC funding landscape remains attractive.

<title>Dubai And DIFC Selected To Host 2026 Global Privacy Assembly</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dubai-and-difc-selected-to-host-2026-global-privacy-assembly-2025224/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dubai-and-difc-selected-to-host-2026-global-privacy-assembly-2025224/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Global Privacy Assembly (GPA) has announced that the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, has been selected to host the GPA conference in 2026.</p>
<p>The Global Privacy Assembly is an international group, established in 1979 as the premier global forum for data protection and privacy authorities. The Assembly is comprised of leading global Information and Privacy Authorities and Commissioners. It is an independent body that operates primarily to uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals.</p>
<p>DIFC&rsquo;s selection reflects the Centre&rsquo;s reputation of being at the forefront of data protection and privacy regulation in the region. With its robust Data Protection Law (DIFC Law No. 5 of 2020), DIFC ensures the highest standards of privacy and data security, fostering trust among global businesses and multi-jurisdictional stakeholders. As a key jurisdiction that facilitates secure, cross-border data flows, DIFC is committed to enabling innovation while ensuring that data is handled ethically and responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hosting the Global Privacy Assembly in 2026 will further highlight DIFC&rsquo;s leadership in privacy governance, solidifying its reputation as a global hub for privacy policy, regulatory excellence, and international cooperation. Hosting the GPA 2026 also provides DIFC with a seat on the Assembly&rsquo;s Executive Committee.</p>
<p>The event will be open to private industry including technology companies, consultants, law firms and non-governmental organisations as well as data protection authorities and other similar organisations admitted to the GPA as Members and Observers.</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;DIFC has set a very high bar for comprehensive privacy and data protection regulation, initially in the Middle East and is now gaining global recognition. It will be an honour to host the Global Privacy Assembly in 2026. The event will allow DIFC to showcase our world-class standards and ensure GPA members become ambassadors for Dubai.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last Assembly was hosted in 2024 by the Jersey Office of the Information Commissioner. When announcing that Dubai had won the bid to host the 2026 event, Jersey&rsquo;s Information Commissioner Paul Vane and the Global Privacy Assembly&rsquo;s Executive Committee, both expressed confidence in the capacity of the DIFC Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office to organise an insightful and engaging programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIFC&rsquo;s world-class legal and regulatory framework is based on international standards and principles of common law. Over the years, the Centre&rsquo;s laws and regulations have continued to evolve, reflecting global best practice. Recently, Data Protection Regulations were amended to address safer, and more ethical management of personal data processing and operations, with Regulation 10, a first-of-its-kind inclusion introduced on the processing of personal data via autonomous and semi-autonomous systems. A Digital Assets Law and Law of Security were introduced, which set out legal characteristics of a digital asset, its proprietary nature, how it may be controlled, transferred, and dealt with by interested parties.</p>
<p>Securing the Global Privacy Assembly is one of several other milestones this year for the DIFC Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, including joining the Global Cooperation Arrangement for Privacy Enforcement (CAPE) and gaining Associate Membership in the Global Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) Forum.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Following yesterday's security incident involving unauthorized activities in our ETH cold wallet, Bybit is pleased to announce the full restoration of services and significant progress in our recovery efforts. Our platform has demonstrated remarkable resilience, processing record-breaking withdrawal volumes while maintaining full operational capacity.</span></p>
<h2><span>What You Need to Know</span></h2>
<p><span>Withdrawals Fully Restored</span></p>
<p><span>Bybit has successfully processed the highest number of withdrawal requests in our history. Within the first 10 hours of the incident, we processed over 350,000 withdrawal requests, completing 99.9% of them by 1:45 AM UTC. As of now, all withdrawals across all tokens are fully operational, with our systems running smoothly and processing without delays. In total, over 580,000 withdrawal requests have been successfully completed.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>All Bybit Services Fully Operational</span></h4>
<p><span>Despite facing one of the most significant security incidents in financial history, all Bybit functions and products remain fully operational. Trading, deposits, and other platform services continue to work as usual.</span></p>
<h4><span>Deposit and Withdrawal Data Back to Normal</span></h4>
<p><span><img alt="Bybit_22Feb25" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Bybit_22Feb25.jpg" title="Bybit_22Feb25" /><br /></span></p>
<p><span>Deposit and Withdrawal Activity has returned to pre-incident levels. As of February 22, 13:00 UTC, total deposits slightly exceeded total withdrawals, signaling strong market confidence.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Custodial funds have fully stabilized:</span>&nbsp;Over the past 12 hours, withdrawal requests have been minimal, reflecting trust in Bybit's custody and exchange operations.</li>
<li><span>Client confidence remains strong:</span>&nbsp;An aggregated deposit of crypto assets valued at approximately $1.5 billion has been observed, further reinforcing our platform's reliability.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Trading Activities Resumed Normalcy</span></h4>
<p><span>Following the incident at 15:00 UTC+8 on February 21, trading volumes initially spiked as users closed positions and reallocated assets. However, trading volumes have since stabilized, and there is no longer any abnormal liquidation or asset sell-off activity. Bybit&rsquo;s trading environment has returned to pre-incident levels.</span></p>
<h4><span>Recovery Progress</span></h4>
<p><span>Bybit has been working closely with the mETH Protocol to recover assets. Through administrative collaboration, the Mantle-powered mETH Protocol successfully retrieved 15,000 cmETH, valued at approximately $42.76 million. Earlier today, mETH Protocol confirmed that cmETH withdrawals have been fully restored.</span></p>
<h4><span>Our Commitment to Users</span></h4>
<p><span>Our team has worked tirelessly, ensuring withdrawals are processed efficiently, reinforcing security measures, and providing immediate support to our users. Bybit remains fully committed to transparency, security, and operational excellence.

<title>Bybit Incident Update: Unauthorized Activity Involving ETH Cold Wallet</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bybit-incident-update-unauthorized-activity-involving-eth-cold-wallet-2025223/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bybit-incident-update-unauthorized-activity-involving-eth-cold-wallet-2025223/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3><span>What happened:</span></h3>
<p>On February 21, 2025, at approximately 12:30 PM UTC , Bybit detected unauthorized activity within one of our Ethereum (ETH) Cold Wallets during a routine transfer process. The transfer was part of a scheduled move of ETH from our ETH Multisig Cold Wallet to our Hot Wallet. Unfortunately, the transaction was manipulated by a sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH Cold Wallet. As a result, over 400,000 ETH and stETH worth more than $1.5 billion were transferred to an unidentified address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>What was the impact:</span></h3>
<p><span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Stolen funds:</span>&nbsp;Over $1.5 billion worth of ETH and stETH have been compromised.</li>
<li><span>Cause:</span>&nbsp;A manipulation of the transfer process in our ETH Multisig Cold Wallet during a planned routine transfer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>What You Need to Know:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span>All Other Cold Wallets Are Secure:</span>&nbsp;We want to reassure you that all other Bybit Cold Wallets are safe, and client funds are unaffected and remain secure.</li>
<li><span>Withdrawals Are Not Halted:</span>&nbsp;We understand that the current situation has led to a surge in withdrawal requests. Although this high volume may result in delays, please be assured that all withdrawals are being processed as normal.</li>
<li><span>1:1 Asset Backing:</span>&nbsp;We want to emphasize that Bybit&rsquo;s reserves are strong and 1:1 backed. All client assets are fully secured, and we are committed to maintaining the integrity of our platform. You can review our Proof of Reserves (PoR) on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bybit.com/app/user/reserve-ratio" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PoR webpage.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to reassure our users that this was an isolated incident involving only the ETH Cold Wallet. All other cold wallets and assets, including BTC, remain secure, and client funds are unaffected.</p>
<h3><span>What Bybit is doing about it:</span></h3>
<p><span>We are working alongside leading blockchain forensic experts to trace the stolen funds and resolve the situation. Our security team is investigating the root cause, with particular attention being given to a potential vulnerability in the user interface of the Safe.global platform, which may have been exploited during the transaction process.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawals are functioning normally, with 70% of pending requests already processed. Some delays may occur due to high volume, but this does not impact your ability to access funds.</li>
<li>Bybit has more than enough assets to cover the loss, with AUM exceeding $20 billion, and will use a bridge loan if necessary to ensure the availability of user funds.</li>
<li>Our platform and all other services, including trading products, cards, and P2P, are fully operational.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We are taking all necessary steps to prevent any further unauthorized activity, and will continue to update our users regularly through our official channels.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>How Bybit can help you:</span></h3>
<p>We remain fully committed to the security of your funds and the integrity of our platform. If you have any concerns or questions, please reach out to our Customer Support team via Live Chat or through our official support channels. We sincerely appreciate your continued trust and understanding. We will provide further updates as our investigation progresses.</p>
<p><span>Thank you for being part of the Bybit community.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Five years ago, I remarked that &ldquo;figuring out how to deal with the SEC on crypto issues [was] like a regulatory version of an escape room.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Now it is time to help open the door. The Task Force, which is composed of exceptional Commission staff, is working on the unlock with other expert, dedicated staff across the Commission. Greater crypto clarity, however, requires the public&rsquo;s input. We welcome input from anyone in the public with an interest in these topics, and a wide range of perspectives (including from skeptics) will make that input richer. This document invites such input by posing some of the questions with which the Task Force is wrestling. The Task Force is actively considering solutions to many of the issues presented. However, your input can significantly aid in that process.</p>
<p>As always, let me start with several disclaimers. My views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the Commission or my fellow Commissioners. These questions are not a roadmap to actions the Commission or its staff will take. They are not meant to limit the discussion, so feel free to pose and answer other questions and to address topics that we have not raised. The scope of this inquiry is expansive and calls on the particularized knowledge of a broad range of people. The Task Force welcomes your responses to as many of the questions as you would like to address, but do not feel compelled to swim outside your lane.</p>
<p>To aid readers, we have drafted questions with a potential taxonomy in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li class="paragraph">First, crypto assets that are securities because they have the intrinsic characteristics of securities;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Second, crypto assets that are offered and sold as part of an investment contract, which is a security, even though the crypto asset may not itself be a security;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Third, tokenized securities; and</li>
<li class="paragraph">Finally, all other crypto assets, which are not securities, in my view, and are currently the biggest category.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Task Force welcomes your thoughts as to the best paths to improve this taxonomy.</p>
<p>The questions below identify some statutes and rules that may present challenges to firms seeking to innovate with crypto assets and blockchain technology, but please identify other federal laws, or state corporate or commercial laws, that present challenges to innovation by Commission registrants. We are looking for creative solutions that comport with the Commission&rsquo;s statutory framework. The Commission&rsquo;s three-part mission will guide our work: 1) protecting investors, 2) maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and 3) facilitating capital formation. Because we hope to make rapid progress and would like to foster a dynamic discussion among respondents, we would appreciate your timely responses but will welcome input at any time. We plan to continue making progress in the meantime, so the earlier we receive your input the more likely it is to inform the options for consideration. Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Finally, as the Task Force works on the issues below, the Commission&rsquo;s efforts continue unabated to combat fraud involving securities, including crypto assets that are securities or that were offered and sold as part of an investment contract, and tokenized securities. The Commission welcomes the public&rsquo;s tips about securities violations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span>Security Status</span></p>
<p>Blockchain technology has given rise to novel assets that rely on cryptographic protocols for their existence (&ldquo;crypto assets&rdquo;). Market participants have expressed a reasonable desire to determine with ease whether such an asset is a security or is being offered or sold as part of an investment contract. When crypto assets that are sold along with promises of future work to develop the ecosystem within which those assets operate, analyzing them under&nbsp;<i>Howey&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;investment contract test can be difficult.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Market participants have expressed concern that the&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>&nbsp;test, as the Commission has applied it, is a complex analysis that can be difficult to apply consistently. One of the Task Force&rsquo;s goals is to make it easier for investors, market participants, and the Commission to categorize crypto assets and crypto asset transactions. To that end, the Task Force is considering questions, including the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>What type of regulatory taxonomy would provide a predictable, legally precise, and economically rational approach to determining the security status of crypto assets and transactions in such assets without undermining settled approaches for evaluating the security status of non-crypto assets and transactions?</li>
<li>Should the Commission address when crypto assets fall within any category of financial instruments, other than investment contracts, that are specifically listed in the definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo; in the federal securities laws?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></li>
<li>Certain crypto assets are used in a variety of functions inherent to the operation of a blockchain network, such as mining or staking as part of a consensus mechanism or securing the network, validating transactions or other related activities on the network, and paying transaction or other fees on the network. These technology functions may be conducted directly or indirectly, such as through third-party service providers. What types of technology functions are inherent to the operation of a blockchain network? Should the Commission address the status of technology functions under the federal securities laws and, if so, what issues should be addressed?</li>
<li>Users of liquid staking applications receive a so-called &ldquo;liquid staking token.&rdquo; This token represents their staked crypto asset, and the token can be used in other activities, all while continuing to participate in the proof-of-stake protocol. Should the Commission address the status of liquid staking tokens under the federal securities laws, and, if so, what issues should it address?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Scoping Out</span></p>
<p>The Commission may be able to provide greater clarity to investors and other market participants by identifying categories of crypto assets (and transactions) that do not fall within its authority. In some cases, these types of crypto assets may be within another regulator&rsquo;s authority. In determining what falls outside the Commission&rsquo;s authority, the Commission should look to the economic reality of what is being offered or sold. Simply saying something is not a security does not mean it is not a security.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Should the security status of certain categories of crypto assets be addressed, such as stablecoins, wrapped tokens, and NFTs?</li>
<li>How can the Commission establish a workable taxonomy while remaining merit- and technology-neutral?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Public Offerings</span></p>
<p>People who have conducted or attempted to conduct registered or qualified token offerings have expressed frustration about the cost and feasibility of registration. Tokens and their issuers can differ significantly in some aspects from traditional securities and their issuers. Allowing token issuers to use appropriately tailored registration regimes may protect investors better than insisting that they use registration forms and mechanisms that are designed for other types of securities offerings.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Could disclosure guidance and/or targeted relief address the concern, or are new forms or other mechanisms needed?</li>
<li>Should the Commission develop tailored disclosure requirements for offerings or classes of specific categories of crypto assets? What types of disclosures would be important for investor protection? Should disclosure occur both at the time of sale and on an ongoing basis? If so, what information should the ongoing disclosure contain and how should that disclosure occur?</li>
<li>Does Regulation A under the Securities Act, including the disclosure and ongoing reporting requirements, provide a useful vehicle to conduct offerings of crypto assets? Would revising aspects of Regulation A make it more useful for crypto asset offerings?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Safe Harbor from Registration</span></p>
<p>I previously proposed that the Commission consider putting in place a non-exclusive safe harbor&mdash;provisionally called Rule 195&mdash;that would, among other things, provide a time-limited exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act for offers and sales of crypto assets during the development of a blockchain project.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;My motivation for suggesting such a safe harbor was to enhance and encourage disclosure and provide network developers with a grace period within which, under certain conditions, they can facilitate broad participation in and the development of a functional or decentralized network. At the end of the safe harbor&rsquo;s term, token transactions may not be securities transactions if the network had matured into a decentralized or functioning network that is not dependent on a single person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. The safe harbor, which would include tailored disclosures subject to the antifraud provisions in the federal securities laws, is intended to respond to the concern that the disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws applicable to registration and offering statements, as well as ongoing reporting, are not tailored for blockchain projects and crypto assets. To be clear, any safe harbor the Task Force recommends will not offer protection for perpetrators of securities fraud.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Should the Commission consider a version of Rule 195, my proposed token safe harbor? Is the iteration on my proposed safe harbor known as &ldquo;Safe Harbor X,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;or some other iteration, a better approach?</li>
<li>Should the safe harbor be available retroactively for projects that comply with the disclosure requirements?</li>
<li>If a safe harbor of some form is the right approach, what disclosure requirements would be feasible for early-stage projects to provide to token purchasers the material information regarding the blockchain project, crypto assets, and development team? What information should be required to be updated on an ongoing basis, and how should that information be provided?</li>
<li>At the expiration of the safe harbor as envisioned, if the network were sufficiently decentralized or functional, registration of the tokens would not be required. If decentralization is used as an indicator of network maturity, should the Commission define objective quantitative thresholds (such as percentage thresholds for ownership and control) to provide greater clarity for issuers, developers, or minters of tokens regarding whether their networks and protocols are sufficiently decentralized and to allow third parties to verify decentralization?<ol>
<li>Is dispersion of control a better framework than decentralization? If so, how should ownership of governance tokens and voting rights be considered in assessing dispersion of control? How should the delegation of voting rights be taken into account?</li>
<li>If an exit marker is achieved, who should be responsible for notifying the Commission?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How should the decentralization of a deployed protocol best be evaluated? How should permissioned aspects of crypto-adjacent software or participant roles, such as validators, relayers, and sequencers, be considered? Are there tech-neutral thresholds that can be agreed upon for determining thresholds for decentralization?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Trading</span></p>
<p>Secondary market trading of crypto assets raises a variety of issues, some of which may fall within the Commission&rsquo;s authority. The Commission&rsquo;s authority in secondary markets generally is limited to assets that themselves are securities based on their intrinsic economic properties or rights, so we have to grapple with how to regulate platforms and market participants that trade securities alongside non-securities.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Should the Commission create a new entity registration status with tailored registration requirements for any platform that trades crypto assets that are securities? Should the Commission use or adapt the existing requirements for national securities exchange registration or the alternative trading system exemption from such registration, and if so, how?</li>
<li>What updates to the Commission rulebook are needed for side-by-side pairs trading of securities and non-security crypto assets to allow for enhanced interoperability and composability in finance?</li>
<li>Does execution in offchain order books or on blockchain networks pose complexities for broker-dealers in satisfying any applicable best execution obligations? Does onchain execution pose complexities for broker-dealers in satisfying their best execution obligations, given onchain complexities such as transaction ordering and block construction? Should any rules, guidelines, or disclosures be modified to address broker-dealer execution reasonably available under the circumstances in offchain and onchain trading environments?</li>
<li>The crypto markets are inherently transparent because they use open-source data, from public blockchains to open application programming interfaces (&ldquo;APIs&rdquo;). Are there programmatic/technological ways that crypto market participants, intermediaries, potential self-regulatory organizations, or regulators can monitor crypto markets using open-source data? How would this take into consideration nested accounts on centralized exchanges, given that this activity may not appear in public ledgers? Is open-source data sufficient for the market to monitor trading and therefore what non-public information might warrant mandatory disclosure? What sort of open-source tools can be used for enhanced transparency, such as proof of reserves, or proof of holdings? What are the limitations of such tools and such data?</li>
<li>With the understanding that both APIs and public ledgers can provide order books, what would be a good strategy for regulators to efficiently ingest and analyze order book data? How can the regulators leverage publicly available data to become more efficient and alleviate regulatory burdens?</li>
<li>How should Commission registrants assess Maximal Extractable Value (&ldquo;MEV&rdquo;) when they consider building or transacting in these environments? How best should Commission registrants delineate between the different types of MEV occurring onchain? In what ways is the market addressing the MEV in which MEV extractors order or re-order transactions to engage in front running, back running, or so-called &ldquo;sandwich attacks&rdquo;?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Custody</span></p>
<p>Market participants have broad and specific questions regarding custody requirements for Commission regulated entities&mdash;broker-dealers, investment advisers, and investment companies&mdash;including whether existing requirements suffice for custodying crypto assets. The Task Force is seeking input on answers to these questions so that individuals and organizations can safely, legally, and practicably custody client crypto assets themselves or with a third party.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Should the Commission amend existing rules, propose new rules, or provide guidance to facilitate custody arrangements for crypto assets? If so, what rule amendments or new rules would be appropriate, and to which types of activities should they apply? Should the Commission propose any specific changes to its rules to accommodate the self-custody of crypto assets by entities registered with the Commission? If so, what conditions should apply to self-custody arrangements to mitigate any related risks? Should the requirements for crypto assets that are securities and those that are not differ?</li>
<li>Public, permissionless blockchains are being used to tokenize permissioned assets. To the extent the custody rules for broker-dealers, investment advisers, and investment companies are implicated, how should the Commission differentiate between native crypto assets of permissionless blockchains and tokenized permissioned assets? Does either type of crypto asset present greater risks of theft or loss?</li>
<li>Are there commonly accepted practices and standards for auditing and accounting for crypto asset investments and transactions, including those related to valuation? How about with respect to verifying the existence and valuation of crypto assets, both among auditors and attestation providers (including non-accountant providers)? Should the Commission propose additional or specific requirements to address the unique nature of crypto assets?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Broker-Dealer Custody and Other Financial Responsibility Requirements</span></p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Should the Commission modify its Special Purpose Broker-Dealer Statement (&ldquo;SPBD Statement&rdquo;) or formally withdraw it? If the former, what should those modifications be? For example, should the Commission expand the SPBD Statement to cover broker-dealers that custody crypto asset securities alongside crypto assets that are not securities? If the Commission decides to eliminate the SPBD Statement, should the Commission propose any modifications to the customer protection rule (17 CFR 240.15c3-3) to address crypto assets?</li>
<li>The net capital rule (17 CFR 240.15c3-1) requires a broker-dealer to maintain sufficient liquid assets to meet all liabilities, including obligations to customers, counterparties, and other creditors and to have adequate additional resources to wind down its business in an orderly manner, without the need for a formal proceeding if the firm fails financially.<ol>
<li>Under the net capital rule, assets held by a broker-dealer must be readily convertible into cash to count as allowable for meeting minimum net capital requirements (<i>e.g.</i>, intangible assets, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and most unsecured receivables are not readily convertible into cash under the rule and, therefore, do not qualify as allowable net capital). How should a given crypto asset be evaluated to assess whether it is readily convertible into cash?</li>
<li>Under the net capital rule, securities and commodities are treated as readily convertible into cash. However, they are subject to deductions (known as haircuts) to account for the market, credit, liquidity, basis, and other risks inherent in the instrument. The haircuts range from 0 to 100 percent. For example, exchange-traded equity securities have a 15 percent haircut, while securities without a ready market (<i>e.g.</i>, securities that are not exchange traded) are subject to haircuts as high as 100 percent. Commodities are subject to a 20 percent haircut. How should crypto assets be evaluated to determine the appropriate haircut to apply?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The recordkeeping rules for broker-dealers (17 CFR 240.17a-3 and 17 CFR 240.17a-4) require the creation and maintenance of accounting and operational records designed to assist a firm in tracking and understanding its assets, liabilities, positions, and obligations to customers (<i>e.g.</i>, cash owed to customers and securities held for customers).<ol>
<li>What challenges, if any, do the requirements of these recordkeeping rules present with respect to crypto assets that are not an issue for traditional securities? What modifications to the rules could address these challenges?</li>
<li>Should crypto assets generally be treated as if they are traditional securities for purposes of these recordkeeping rules?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Investment Adviser Custody and Other Requirements</span></p>
<ol start="27">
<li>What challenges do registered investment advisers (&ldquo;RIAs&rdquo;) face in complying with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (&ldquo;Advisers Act&rdquo;) as it relates to investments in crypto assets that are securities? What common practices, if any, have developed to address these challenges?<ol>
<li>Could best execution or recordkeeping obligations, or compliance with Form ADV or Form PF disclosure requirements, be clearer in the crypto asset context?</li>
<li>Do any crypto asset characteristics or market structures place advisory client crypto assets at a greater or different risk of theft, loss, or misappropriation? If so, how can those risks be addressed?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Can RIAs trade, stake, vote, or otherwise participate without moving crypto assets outside a qualified custodian? Should the Commission amend the existing RIA custody rule to provide an exception to allow RIAs to move client crypto assets temporarily out of qualified custodial arrangements to engage in staking, voting, or other novel participatory features of crypto assets? If so, should that exception be subject to time limits or other limitations or requirements?</li>
<li>What clarifications, if any, are needed in the Advisers Act regulations to address the cold or hot storage of crypto assets held in custody on behalf of a client?<ol>
<li>What requirements, if any, should the Commission consider for the custody of crypto assets held in each type of wallet on behalf of a client? Should the requirements be the same for both types of wallets?</li>
<li>How would a requirement to maintain custody of some or all crypto assets in either cold or hot storage affect an adviser&rsquo;s ability to transact in those crypto assets or otherwise implement its investment strategy?</li>
<li>What means are available to mitigate the risks related to maintaining crypto assets in hot storage?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><span>Investment Company Custody</span></p>
<ol start="30">
<li>What challenges do registered investment companies (&ldquo;funds&rdquo;) face in complying with section 17(f) of the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder (governing custody) with respect to investments in crypto assets? Are any specific requirements of section 17(f) or the rules thereunder categorically inconsistent with custody of crypto assets? Do funds anticipate that custodians currently eligible to act as fund custodians under the Investment Company Act and the custody rules (<i>e.g.</i>, banks, foreign banks, broker-dealers) will offer fund custodial services for crypto assets?</li>
<li>Can a fund comply with the requirements of section 17(f) and the rules thereunder when trading, staking, voting, or otherwise engaging with crypto assets in which it invests? Should the Commission consider any changes to rule 17f-2 (the self-custody rule) or any other rules to facilitate transactions in crypto assets, and if so, what tailored conditions should the Commission propose to mitigate any related risks?</li>
<li>Should any provisions relating to investment company custody be revised to account for investment activities or other transactions that are unique to crypto assets (<i>e.g.</i>, staking, mining, airdrops)? Do the existing custody rules present obstacles to such activities or transactions? How might these activities or transactions place a fund&rsquo;s assets at risk of theft or loss?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Crypto Lending</span></p>
<p>Crypto platforms may offer custodial and noncustodial services through which people can lend their crypto assets in return for interest. Crypto lending concepts vary widely, challenging many traditional notions of financial products. I would welcome any input you have on these diverse products to ensure the Commission has an adequate understanding.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>How should the Commission approach various crypto lending concepts in a way that doesn&rsquo;t stifle the potential opportunities they provide?</li>
<li>Participation in traditional securities lending programs, such as fully paid securities lending programs offered by broker-dealers, generally does not represent a new securities transaction or implicate Investment Company Act registration requirements. How are crypto lending programs similar to or different from traditional securities lending programs?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Crypto Exchange-Traded Products (&ldquo;ETPs&rdquo;)</span></p>
<p>Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5) requires that an exchange&rsquo;s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. In reviewing listing applications for crypto asset-based ETPs, the Commission previously has considered whether the exchange has a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement (&ldquo;SSA&rdquo;) with a regulated market of significant size related to the underlying or reference assets. How should the Commission address listing applications for crypto asset-based ETPs going forward?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>If the listing exchange does not have an SSA with a regulated market and no regulated market for the crypto asset underlying an ETP exists, could the listing exchange address concerns regarding fraud and manipulation based on the size and liquidity of the underlying spot market? What would be an appropriate measure of size and liquidity that would address these concerns? Are there more appropriate ways to address concerns regarding fraud and manipulation?</li>
<li>How should the Commission consider market capitalization, unique number of wallets, trading volume, the number of spot markets, geographic distribution of spot markets, size and frequency of price divergences, or speed of price convergence/arbitrage?</li>
<li>How should the Commission consider crypto asset-based ETPs that are investing in assets that are already referenced in crypto asset-based exchange-traded funds registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act?</li>
<li>What factors should the Commission consider with respect to an SSA between an<br />exchange listing an ETP on a crypto asset and a spot crypto market?</li>
<li>How should the Commission weigh the reliability, frequency, and dissemination of pricing information on the crypto assets underlying the ETP in its consideration?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Tokenized Securities</span></p>
<p>Creating a digital representation of a security on a blockchain or issuing a security directly on a blockchain does not change the substance of the security but may benefit issuers and investors. Moreover, the use of a blockchain-based database may be more secure in some respects than using a centralized database with a single point of failure. Tokenization also may give rise to unique risks and challenges.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Tokenization enables dematerialized securities to be mobilized (<i>i.e.</i>, not held in and confined to a single centralized ledger). Are there any provisions under the federal securities laws that prevent these securities from being used in new blockchain-based transactions and applications, and, if so, what steps should the Commission consider taking to facilitate this innovation while mitigating any related risks? Are there amendments or new rules that the Commission should consider to ensure a merit- and technology-neutral approach to tokenization? Does the type of blockchain used (<i>i.e.</i>, permissioned versus permissionless) bear on this risk assessment?</li>
<li>How do the programmability and composability properties of blockchain technology and blockchain-based technologies, such as smart contracts, affect the role of a transfer agent? Are there provisions in the transfer agent rules that prevent transfer agents from using blockchain technology for this purpose to the fullest extent possible? Is an offchain record still needed as an official or a complementary record in a tokenization arrangement? Are there any legal or regulatory impediments to using onchain identity solutions?</li>
<li>Does the tokenization of redeemable registered investment company securities, such as those of a mutual fund or money market fund, raise any unique issues under the Investment Company Act or the rules thereunder? Would secondary transactions in these securities (<i>e.g.</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>peer-to-peer transactions or transactions occurring on or through an ATS) require relief from any provisions of the Investment Company Act? If so, should the Commission propose any changes to facilitate tokenization of registered investment company securities, and what should any such conditions be?</li>
<li>How should the Commission approach tokenized securities that seek to maintain a stable value and may be designed to be used as a means of payment or settlement? What are the challenges and impediments to the usability and transferability of these tokenized securities, particularly securities issued by offchain entities (<i>e.g.</i>, registered investment companies)? Should transactions involving the use of these tokenized securities as a means of payment be treated differently from other security-based transactions?</li>
<li>Do other federal laws, or state corporate or commercial laws present challenges to firms seeking to issue tokenized securities or engage in activities involving tokenized securities?</li>
<li>The Commission recently adopted rule amendments to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from &ldquo;T+2&rdquo; to &ldquo;T+1,&rdquo; subject to certain exceptions. Tokenization is often characterized as an innovation that facilitates instant or simultaneous settlement (&ldquo;atomic settlement&rdquo;) if all parts of a transaction are executed and settled on the same blockchain. What are the benefits of atomic settlement, and what are the risks? Should the Commission consider taking any actions that would encourage adoption of atomic settlement?</li>
<li>What issues are raised by the tokenization of securities subject to National Market System (&ldquo;NMS&rdquo;) requirements? Should the Commission clarify any requirements or provide relief from any requirements under Regulation NMS? Are there any other SEC rules that should be clarified or amended to address the trading of tokenized equity or debt securities?</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Sandbox and Related International Issues</span></p>
<p>Last year, I proposed the creation of a micro-innovation sandbox (&ldquo;Sandbox&rdquo;), which could be used for small-scale projects, including tokenization and blockchain projects.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-rfi-022125#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<ol start="47">
<li class="paragraph">Would the Sandbox help foster tokenization and blockchain innovation? What types of products and services across the fintech landscape would firms like to test in the Sandbox? What regulatory, technical, and operational barriers pose the biggest challenges to innovation in this space? Could the Sandbox mitigate those challenges?</li>
<li class="paragraph">Could a cross-border Sandbox address challenges that U.S. and non-U.S. firms face when attempting to innovate in multiple jurisdictions? If so, how should the Commission structure it to operate globally? Do sandboxes in other jurisdictions serve as a good model?</li>
</ol>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="row">
<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, President Daly, for organizing this conference and for the opportunity to talk to this group.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I have paid close attention to the papers presented at this annual conference in the past, and I look forward to today's presentations and discussion.</p>
<p>Today, I will talk about central bank communications and the use of textual analysis tools. These tools help process qualitative information that may be hard to capture in numerical forecasts. Also, they can improve our understanding of economic concepts that are otherwise difficult to measure. This topic has been covered at this conference in the past. Last year, for example, there was a paper on the program that highlighted the importance of considering the impact that speeches by the Chair of the Federal Reserve (Fed) have on asset prices when evaluating the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;This paper also shows that speeches by the Vice Chair are less important than those by the Chair. So this might be a good time to catch up on your text messages! (Just kidding!)</p>
<p>My&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-roadmap-20250221.PNG" id="fig2">talk</a>&nbsp;is organized as follows. First, I will briefly discuss central bank communication and its effect on asset prices. Next, I will discuss how recent advances in automated textual analysis may be having an impact on how the information in central bank communication is incorporated into asset prices. Then I will review how researchers and market participants use textual analysis techniques, among other techniques, to gauge who is listening to central bank communication and to understand how monetary policy is transmitted to the economy. Before concluding, I will broaden my coverage and discuss how textual analysis tools can be used to estimate difficult-to-measure concepts in economics such as uncertainty and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>These new textual analysis techniques are important to me as a policymaker because I want to understand how our communications are being heard, interpreted, understood, and acted upon.</p>
<p><strong>Central Bank Communication and its Effect on Financial Markets</strong><br />Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke often highlighted the importance of central bank communication, saying that "monetary policy is 98 percent talk and 2 percent action."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Obviously, the "98 percent" is hyperbole; it is not meant to be taken as an exact measure of how much of the transmission of monetary policy is due to central bank communication. Even so, research and my own experience confirm that central bank communication is key for the transmission of monetary policy. In remarks I delivered almost two years ago, I discussed how monetary policy is transmitted to the rest of the economy through financial market prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Changes in the federal funds target range are transmitted to overnight money market rates and other short-term interest rates through arbitrage relationships. The configuration of short-term interest rates, central bank communication about the likely future path of short-term interest rates, and the associated economic outlook, in turn, affect long-term interest rates through investors' expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Higher long-term interest rates increase the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, thereby affecting households' and businesses' spending, savings, and investment decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution of Fed Communications</strong><br />Policymakers' approach to communication has evolved over time. In the past, policymakers were not focused on clarity and transparency in their communications as they are today. For example, former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan famously quipped in 1987, "If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;In the 1990s, however, he started to embrace transparency.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure1-20250221.PNG" id="fig3">Figure 1</a>&nbsp;shows a timeline of the steps taken toward increasing transparency at the Fed since the 1990s. In 1993, the Fed started to publish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes in their current form, and, soon after, it began releasing FOMC meeting transcripts with a five-year lag. In February 1994, the FOMC started to issue post-FOMC meeting statements following meetings at which there was a change in the intended policy stance. Later, it regularly incorporated the target federal funds rate into these statements. In May 1999, the FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, even on occasions when there was no change in policy. In 2004, the FOMC accelerated the release of the minutes to three weeks after the meeting as opposed to after the subsequent FOMC meeting. During the tenure of former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the Fed's transparency increased significantly. In November 2007, the FOMC began releasing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). In 2011, Chair Bernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting. In 2012, under his leadership, the FOMC adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent in its new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Also, it started publishing anonymized individual FOMC participants' views on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now famously known as the "dot plot." In 2019, Chair Powell continued this march toward transparency and started holding press conferences after every FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Of course, Chair Powell and other policymakers testify regularly before Congress, as required by law. Also, FOMC participants give public speeches and transparently discuss their views on monetary policy and associated issues, as evidenced by my speech here today.</p>
<p>Previously, I have spoken about two primary reasons for the increase in transparency.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;First, transparency allows for greater accountability to the public. Second, there is a growing appreciation in the economics profession that clarity about policy actions helps the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy by, for example, making asset prices more informationally efficient. Relatedly, by conveying aspects of the Fed's reaction function, communications can help inform investors' views about the likely future path of monetary policy in a way that helps achieve the Fed's monetary policy objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Using Textual Analysis to Quantify Central Bank Communication</strong><br />Central bank communication is clearly important in shaping the path of interest rates, so it is not surprising that investors and researchers use textual analysis techniques, including artificial intelligence, to quantify in an automated way information conveyed through FOMC statements and other communications, such as speeches by Governors and Fed Bank presidents.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Researchers have tested the hypothesis that clarity about policy actions would help the transmission of monetary policy to the rest of the economy. Using textual analysis, high-frequency asset price data, and high-frequency central bank communication data, this research shows that investors' reactions to specific sentences communicated by the central bank are quickly incorporated into asset prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;In addition, economists have used textual analysis to understand how media reporting of central bank communication affects short-term interest rates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;For example, some have used a bag-of-words technique to estimate media sentiment during FOMC announcement days.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;By design, a high media sentiment is meant to capture times when journalists report that the FOMC is more likely to tighten monetary policy in the near future.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure2-20250221.PNG" id="fig4">Figure 2</a>&nbsp;shows that the correlation between media sentiment and six-month U.S. Treasury yield changes is positive and relatively high (40 percent), which suggests that media reporting of central bank communication plays an important role in the transmission of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Policymakers know that their communications are likely to affect the course of short-term interest rates, other asset prices, and the associated economic outlook, resulting in an easing or tightening of financial conditions. Therefore, policymakers have always paid close attention to what they say, well before market participants started applying artificial intelligence tools to central bank communications.</p>
<p>In general, researchers argue that automated textual analysis and automated trading have increased the speed with which information is incorporated into asset prices. That suggests that asset prices have become more informationally efficient, sometimes in a matter of seconds or even milliseconds instead of minutes after information is released.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Thus, increased transparency and advances in technology have potentially made asset prices more informationally efficient, which, in turn, helps with the transmission of monetary policy. Yet others argue that automated algorithms may be more prone to mistakes than humans, may provide an incentive for investors to value speed over accuracy, and may reduce the long-run informativeness of asset prices, which could hurt the transmission of monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>I look forward to the findings of future research as we develop a deeper understanding of this issue. For now, I do not think artificial intelligence is changing the way policymakers communicate, but research shows that it has affected how quickly information about policy is incorporated into asset prices.</p>
<p><strong>Central Bank Communication: Is Anyone Listening?</strong><br />Next, I will discuss whether research using textual analysis is helping policymakers to understand better who is listening to central bank communication. In 2018, former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder predicted that "central banks will keep trying to communicate with the general public, as they should. But for the most part, they will fail."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;He explained further that "many economic models presume that central bank communication is aimed at wage-setters, price-setters, consumers, or investors&mdash;maybe all of them. But are they listening?" His answer was&nbsp;<em>no</em>, they are not listening to central bank communications, and he cited economic research using survey data to support his answer.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>More recently, however, research shows that nonexperts and households&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;listening to central bank communications. Some of this research uses textual analysis, and some uses randomized control trials. Researchers have used textual analysis to process automatically and quantify more than 3.2 million posts on social media by experts and nonexperts. This research shows that journalists and professional forecasters who comment often on central bank policies, as well as nonexperts who do not comment regularly on central bank policies do listen to central bank communications.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p><strong>Central Bank Communication and Monetary Policy Transmission</strong><br />Further, research shows that direct central bank communication and the media's reporting of central bank communication are highly correlated. Yet when they do not align, the media's reporting tends to have a larger effect on asset prices and professional forecasters' views about the future than the central bank's direct communication.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;In addition, a randomized control trial with nearly 20,000 U.S. individuals shows that central bank communication affects households' inflation expectations, which, in turn, affects their behavior as measured by scanner-collected data.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;This research shows that while central bank communication tends to affect household expectations and spending behavior, the way households receive information matters. In particular, households appear to react more to information conveyed by social media, friends, and family than to information conveyed by traditional media. All told, this research suggests that central bank efforts to communicate with the general public are having some success, but there is still room for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring Economic Concepts Using Textual Analysis</strong><br />Textual analysis is not only helping researchers understand who is listening to central bank communication. Generally, it is helping them to measure qualitative information that is hard to capture with numerical forecasts and estimate difficult-to-measure economic concepts such as uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, and financial conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;As I mentioned in a previous speech, uncertainty is not directly observable in the same way that inflation and economic output are.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the difficulty in measuring uncertainty, researchers have developed tools to assess it. In fact, in the past two decades, there has been tremendous growth in research devoted to the subject, especially on text-based measures of uncertainty. For example, researchers created an economic policy uncertainty index, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure3-20250221.PNG" id="fig5">figure 3</a>, based on the number of leading newspaper articles that contain a combination of words related to economic policy uncertainty.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;As shown in the figure, economic uncertainty in the U.S. reached an all-time high at the onset of the pandemic, came down slightly after the pandemic, and has recently increased as the potential economic implications of new government policies are discussed in newspaper articles. Research also shows that newspaper text-based measures are highly correlated with stock price volatility, and that higher values of these measures are associated with lower investment and employment. A corollary to that insight is that policymakers should communicate as clearly as possible to avoid increasing uncertainty.</p>
<p>Recent research has also discovered that narrative sentiment conveys information that may be hard to capture in numerical forecasts. For example, it was shown that the tone of text accompanying a set of economic forecasts produced by the Fed's staff, predicts forecast errors of the Fed's staff as well as Blue Chip participants.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;The predictive power of sentiment seems to be arising from signaling the downside risks to economic performance for output, employment, and stock returns. These findings suggest that the tone of the narrative captures information that is not necessarily provided by corresponding forecasts. Not surprisingly, given this information, the tonality has predictive power for stock prices as well as monetary policy surprises.</p>
<p>Another example of how textual analysis is helping researchers estimate difficult-to-measure concepts is new measures of firms' demand and supply shocks. Traditionally, academic researchers use sign restrictions in price and quantity measures to identify and differentiate demand shocks from supply shocks. An increase in price and quantity is considered a demand shock; an increase in price accompanied by a decline in quantity is considered a supply shock. These so-called sign restrictions are useful tools; however, it is possible that an increase in price and quantity can be due to a surge in demand in the face of supply chain disruptions. Other popular measures of supply chain disruptions are supplier delivery times and order backlogs provided by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). These measures, however, only estimate firm activity relative to the previous month and can lack important context for understanding short-term dynamics that can otherwise be captured in qualitative, text-based measures. Thus, it can be useful to complement sign restriction methods, supplier delivery times, and order backlogs with textual analysis techniques that quantify firms' narratives in earnings calls and the Beige Book to identify better demand and supply shocks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure4-20250221.PNG" id="fig6">figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows the Supply Chain Bottleneck Sentiment Index, the solid black line, estimated by a Board economist using textual analysis techniques to quantify the information conveyed in the Fed's Beige Book publications, along with the ISM Supplier Delivery Index, the dashed red line.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;For illustration purposes, both indexes are normalized to have a zero mean and a standard deviation equal to one, with large positive numbers indicating that supply chains are stressed. Both indexes surged in the 1970s after the oil price increase and ensuing energy crisis. Supply chain disruptions reappeared in the 2000s with chip shortages, and, most recently, bottlenecks arose during the COVID-19 pandemic. The figure illustrates how the text-based measure signals a more prolonged period of supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. Comparing both measures, we see that the monthly changes in delivery times improved at a fast pace, as shown in the ISM index, but narratives of the post-pandemic recovery, as captured in the Beige Book, were signaling elevated levels of supply chain disruptions that eased more slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />The idea of using qualitative information on media, government records, central bank, or management communication in economic research to understand better the transmission of monetary policy is not new.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a>&nbsp;What is novel is that, in the past two decades, there have been advances in textual analysis techniques and incredible growth of data that are easily available to researchers and investors, in terms of both volume and variety. The advances in textual analysis techniques and the growth in alternative data have, in turn, helped researchers to better estimate difficult-to-measure economic concepts, to more easily identify who listens to central bank communications, and to investigate how quickly central bank communication is incorporated into asset prices, among other things. Also, we have greater access to high-frequency data, such as millisecond timestamp financial transactions, and "alternative data," which includes textual information from social media posts. As I mentioned earlier, these new textual analysis techniques are important to policymakers because we seek to understand how our communications are being heard, interpreted, understood, and acted upon.</p>
<p>While I am grateful that textual analysis techniques and data access have improved over the years, I will end on a cautionary note. Automatic textual analysis should not be regarded as superseding other analysis of the historical record on monetary policy. A wealth of data and techniques to analyze text does not necessarily translate into greater insight. Therefore, it is important that policymakers, researchers, and investors continue to be diligent in using the right tools and the right data to make the best possible inferences.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#fn26" title="footnote 26"><span>26</span></a><a name="f26"></a></p>

<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. More specifically, according to the expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates, intermediate- and long-term interest rates are importantly affected by the weighted average of expected future short-term interest rates. In addition, monetary policy affects risk premiums (see, for example, Bernanke and Kuttner, 2005; Hanson and Stein, 2015; and Gertler and Karadi, 2015) and term premiums (if monetary policy tightens in response to inflationary shocks, term premiums also tend to rise as longer-maturity bonds become riskier; see, for example, Piazzesi and Schneider, 2006).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#f5"></a></p>

<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. A bag-of-words technique is a natural language processing technique that uses a collection (or "bag") of words and a scoring system to quantify qualitative textual information. Schmanski and others (2023) use this technique to pair a set of topic keywords with modifiers and determine whether the combination of topic-modifier communicates tightening, neutral, or easing news. By construction, the sentiment is high when the media thinks the FOMC is more likely to tighten monetary policy in the near future.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250221a.htm#f11"></a></p>

<h2>T+1 settlement: improving market efficiency</h2>
<p>We are fully supportive of the UK moving to a T+1 settlement cycle for securities trades. Our letter to the Prime Minister on supporting growth highlighted that 'accelerating adoption of securities settlement in 1 day (T+1) ... will make markets more efficient'. We also see other benefits arising from T+1, including improved liquidity, better use of capital and the reduction of risks for market participants.</p>
<p>The move to T+1 is aligned with our strategic objective to ensure markets function well. It also supports our strategy and wider commitment to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets while supporting growth and innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the event today, we have also heard the strong case set out by others for T+1.</p>

<h2>Welcoming the Accelerated Settlements Taskforce&rsquo;s final report</h2>
<p>We welcome publication of the Accelerated Settlements Taskforce&rsquo;s (AST) final report.</p>
<p>I want to commend members of the group for the strong progress they have made in setting out a detailed implementation plan for the UK to move to a T+1 settlement cycle by 11 October 2027. We are grateful to all of you for your work, for the opportunity to act as observers on the group and to Andrew for his strong leadership. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed that the cover of the report is a fetching colour of go-faster green, which is most appropriate for looking forward to the next stage of the work!</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h2>Looking forward &ndash; what should firms do next?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Looking forward, firms must now turn their attention to implementing the new T+1 requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our role will be to support firms as they transition. All firms that participate in wholesale markets are likely to be impacted in some way, from banks, to asset managers, to platforms and corporates. However, the operational changes and challenges faced will likely differ from firm to firm depending on, among other factors, their business models, the settlement systems they currently utilise and the capacity for those systems to be upgraded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is only one message I would like you all to take away today is that you should start thinking now and put a plan in place as soon as possible to move to T+1 by the deadline.</p>
<p>You may think October 2027 is a long way from now, but for some firms there is much to be done and no firm should delay. I want to be clear today on our expectations for firms and what they should be doing to meet the new T+1 requirement in time for October 2027. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider 4 key areas in this context.</p>
<h3>1. Read the AST report</h3>
<p>The move to T+1 is a market-led initiative. The AST report sets out a roadmap of technical and operational recommendations that firms should implement, along with specified timings. It also sets out expected behaviours for firms. Firms should read carefully the contents of the AST&rsquo;s report now and identify how best they can be implemented for their firm. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Plan early</h3>
<p>Firms must plan and prepare early for the move to T+1. This notion is aligned with the Code of Conduct&rsquo;s expected behaviour to 'action this day'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms should not wait until 2027 to put in place relevant changes. Firms must start planning and putting plans into action from now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms should determine what changes are required and how they will need to implement them, while seeking to avoid any unnecessary costs or complexity. Consideration should also be given to any changes to areas related to securities settlement, such as securities financing and foreign exchange markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key recommendations in the report centres on the operational processes that need to take place to ensure faster settlement, including trade allocations and confirmations as well as the submission of settlement instructions to the Central Securities Depository. We encourage firms to consider their own processes and what may need to change to facilitate accelerated settlement.</p>
<p>We also encourage firms to consider taking advantage of appropriate innovations in automation which may bring greater efficiency through increased settlement speed and accuracy. Automation may increase a firm's processing capability, thereby increasing their resilience for dealing with extra volumes and increased risks at times of market stress. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Budget to execute the plan</h3>
<p>Firms should consider any budgeting or resourcing needs for executing the plans they make. For example, plans to make changes to processes or operational systems may need special budgets or additional resources. The AST report contemplates that budgeting activity would happen this year, 2025. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Act to implement and test the changes</h3>
<p>We expect firms to take timely action to put their plans into effect and to maintain momentum for the changes needed throughout the transition period. In considering the timeliness for action, regard must be given to testing. The changes required for T+1, such as the adoption of new or updated operating systems, need to be made in time to allow for testing both internally and with external parties.</p>
<p>Firms will need to engage early and regularly with all parties that are involved with their settlement processes. This includes all relevant internal stakeholders such as the front, middle and back office, legal and compliance, as well as their counterparties and any third-party service providers. Regular engagement and a clear understanding of roles and responsibilities will help to ensure a smoother ride to implementation.</p>
<p>In addition, we encourage firms to engage with the AST to raise any questions, to flag any difficulties and to make suggestions on what the group may do to make implementation happen more smoothly. Also, they could consider, as appropriate, whether to engage with trade associations or other market groups.</p>
<p>The AST report observes that the sooner firms implement the steps they need to take to move to T+1, the sooner they can capitalise on the benefits.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-our-approach-to-support-t-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Our approach to support T+1</h2>
<p>And I want to turn your attention now to what our approach will be as we support the industry move to T+1. Alongside the Treasury and the Bank of England we will continue our role as observers on the group. This will give us the opportunity to understand how firms are progressing through the transition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the move to T+1 by October 2027 is industry-led, we will use aspects of our existing supervisory approach to support industry. We consider this in 3 core areas: engagement with firms, comms and market monitoring. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Engaging with firms</h3>
<p>We will engage with firms on their T+1 plans as a part of our ongoing supervision. We may engage bilaterally or, where appropriate, in a wider forum, such as with trade associations. In discussing their plans, we would expect firms to cover how they are meeting our expectations on preparedness and how their activities are aligned, or not, with the recommendations as set out in the UK T+1 Code of Conduct. We expect firms to be open with us about their plans and any barriers they may face.</p>
<p>We also plan to have engagement beyond our supervised firms with other market participants also impacted by the transition, including corporates and other non-financial counterparties.</p>
<h3>Our communication strategy</h3>
<p>We will use an active communications strategy throughout the transition period. Alongside the press statement released earlier this week, we launched a new T+1 webpage on our FCA website. This page will be updated regularly and used as a &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo;, to promote T+1 awareness and to send other messages, for example, on our expectations for firms. We will also consider the use of other existing communication tools &ndash; including speeches &ndash; where appropriate to promote the transition. So, keep an eye out for all of those! &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Monitoring the market</h3>
<p>Furthermore, with the data and other evidence available to us, we will monitor the market during and after the transition period to help us gauge firm progress on the move to T+1 and identify any issues that need to be addressed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to an orderly, timely transition to the new market standard of T+1 led by the market itself. However, where we see actions or inaction that would harm market integrity through this process, we will consider whether we need to intervene further.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-international-coordination">
<div class="container">
<h2>International coordination</h2>
<p>Securities markets are inherently global and cross-border. We therefore recognise the importance of ongoing international coordination. We believe such coordination should maximise the probability of an orderly transition, while minimising the frictions and costs of misalignment.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we recognise the government&rsquo;s engagement with other European jurisdictions to support an aligned move to T+1 across Europe and the growing convergence around 11 October 2027 as the date for the move. We agree with the government that alignment would be highly desirable, and comparable views have been expressed to us by market participants.</p>
<p>Further, the benefits of international coordination extend to engagement between international regulators, and between industry groups in different countries, on experiences and plans with regards to the T+1 transition. For example, we support the feedback that we should learn lessons from the US transition and are grateful to the many firms involved that have already shared their experiences.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-key-takeaways">
<div class="container">
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<p>Our aim is for all market participants to move to a T+1 settlement cycle efficiently and successfully by 11 October 2027 with limited market disruption.</p>
<p>The clear message to take away today, as we embark on this next phase of the UK&rsquo;s move to T+1, is that we expect firms to be prepared for the move to T+1. Remember the 4 key areas I have just highlighted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read carefully the AST report. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Plan early. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Budget to execute the plan. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Act to implement and test the changes, on a timely basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>We look forward to engaging with firms through the transition to T+1 and realising the benefits and efficiencies this initiative will bring to the UK market, including its role in supporting growth and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, ACER releases its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVVwAGA1RUW0xbBwQHHVZfVgQdCwkIABoGBgJWUgUGBwQEUgIdB1daAg5SDQIdUQtQDx0GCQFVGgxTCwcZUVMEBFNXAABRVVdYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report on the Swedish gas transmission tariff</a>&nbsp;directed at the Swedish National Regulatory Authority (NRA), Energimarknadsinspektionen (Ei), and Transmission System Operator, Swedegas.</p>
<p>The report assesses whether the proposed Reference Price Methodology (RPM) complies with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff structures (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgVTV1BUVkwPAlcGHVZYDQ4dUFsAXhpWAAoCVlJRAgcJUgYdB1daAg5SDQIdUQtQDx0GCQFVGgxTCwcZUVMEBFNXAABRVVdYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The consultation document provides most of the required information, however, the forecasted contracted capacity, tariff comparison between periods, and detailed information on some non-transmission services are missing.</li>
<li>The proposed RPM does not fully meet the transparency requirements of the NC TAR.</li>
<li>The postage stamp methodology is well justified, but ACER cannot conclude that it complies with the NC TAR&rsquo;s cost-reflectivity principle.</li>
<li>Cross-subsidisation levels are reasonable, and the proposed RPM complies with the principles of non-discrimination, volume risk, and the prevention of distortions in cross-border trade.</li>
<li>Insufficient details on the three non-transmission services (fees for extra area consumption, capacity allocation for summer and winter periods, and capacity allocation for daily capacity products) prevent a full assessment of their compliance with NC TAR.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>
<p>ACER recommends that the NRA, when adopting its decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes the missing elements and clarifies inconsistencies in the calculation of input parameters for the tariff-setting process, ensuring stakeholders fully understand the methodology.</li>
<li>Specifies the start of the regulatory period for the proposed RPM and the applicability of the consulted tariff.</li>
<li>Provides the missing information on the three additional non-transmission services.</li>

<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XdBieadRpF9S0yKd4QpSap7HUHaOlGCfd_untOuHtFVGdck1Hal90dyQ9upYXIOEbtRP4GVXf2vr36jG3s6NK9-IYjhXQbmPZ1HY19FXzpr4-dwuPmz5i2j60xHXWbcS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for January 2025. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly decrease in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 4,505 in January, which is down 36.9% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, North American corporate requests were down 24.2% over January 2024 totals. The monthly decrease in volume was driven by a 32.6% decline in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-27.1%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-14.8%) also fell in January.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 14.1% versus December totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 1.8%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 78 new CUSIP requests in January, followed by California and New York, each of which had 59 new municipal CUSIP requests in the first month of the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monthly CUSIP request volume may appear to be off to a slow start when compared to the strong volumes we saw in the second half of 2024, but most major asset classes are seeing gains versus year-ago totals,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s still early in the year, and there is no shortage of uncertainty about the future of interest rates and the broader economy, issuers are likely to enter the markets at a historically brisk pace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 19.5% in January and international debt CUSIP requests rose 14.0%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were down 13.0% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 33.3%.</p>

<p><span>Background:&nbsp;Brief description of the Euronext Lisbon Awards categories</span></p>
<p>Established in 2011, the Euronext Lisbon Awards distinguish issuers, financial intermediaries, and other institutions and individuals who have excelled in the capital market in the year prior to the award.</p>
<p><span>Equity champion</span>&nbsp;| Recognises the listed company with the highest total return, reflecting share price performance and dividend payments. Eligible companies are those listed on the markets operated by Euronext Lisbon, including foreign companies. Companies with a turnover velocity below 10% or those with a negative performance are not eligible. This award is given in two categories:&nbsp;<em>blue chip</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>SME</em>. For the purpose of this award, a company is classified as a&nbsp;<em>blue chip</em>&nbsp;if, at the end of the previous year, it has a market capitalisation equal to or above &euro;1,000 million, while it is classified as an&nbsp;<em>SME</em>&nbsp;if its market capitalisation is below this threshold.</p>
<p><span>Issuer of the year</span>&nbsp;| Recognises the issuer that carried out the most significant and high-profile transaction in the Portuguese capital market.</p>
<p><span>Market member</span>&nbsp;| Awarded to the member with the highest traded value (&euro;) on Euronext Lisbon in the securities identified for this category (equities and bonds).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Fee structure enhancement to align with the notional value traded, taking effect in June 2025</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Minimum and maximum components of the stock settlement fee will be removed, with a new ad valorem rate at&nbsp;</span><span>0.42 bps (0.0042%) for each trade</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Eligible market making trades for Exchange Traded Products (ETP) will be charged at 0.20 bps (0.0020%)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="spanHeading">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (Friday) enhancements to the securities market stock settlement fee structure that are aimed at boosting market efficiency and ensuring consistent fee application across all trade sizes.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The current stock settlement fee structure, which includes a minimum fee of $2 and a maximum fee of $100, disproportionately impacts lower-value trades. To address this, HKEX will remove the minimum and maximum fee components, and adjust the ad valorem rate to 0.42 bps (0.0042%) for each trade. The new fee structure is designed to be cost-neutral to the market as a whole, creating a more equitable fee structure across all trade sizes.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>In addition, the stock settlement fee for eligible market making trades for Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)</span><span>&nbsp;will be set at a rate of 0.20 bps (0.0020%), removing the minimum and maximum fees. This adjustment aligns with the historical costs of ETP market-making activities and aims to ensure the ongoing provision of liquidity to the ETP market.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Based on HKEX data,&nbsp;<a></a>about 77 per cent&nbsp;</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;</span><span>of all securities trades conducted between 2019 and 2024 would benefit from lower fees under the new structure</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Chief Operating Officer&nbsp;<a></a>and Group Chief Financial Officer</span><span class="spanHeading"></span><span>, Vanessa Lau, said: &ldquo;At HKEX, we are committed to building a vibrant and efficient marketplace for our global investors. We are, therefore, pleased to introduce an enhanced stock settlement fee structure that is clear, consistent and equitable&nbsp;</span><span>for all trades sizes, supporting our retail and institutional investors in executing their trading strategies. This is also part of our ongoing initiatives to elevate the breadth and depth of our securities market, reinforcing Hong Kong&rsquo;s position as a premier financial centre of choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">The new fee structure, which has been approved by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), will take effect in June 2025, ahead of the implementation of Phase 1 of the minimum spreads reduction, subject to market readiness. The reduction of minimum spreads would encourage trades to be executed in smaller sizes, thus benefiting from the new fee structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Please refer to the&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/Services/Circulars-and-Notices/Participant-and-Members-Circulars/HKSCC/2025/HKSCC-Circular_Stock-Settlement-Fee-Restructure_20250220_f_clean.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">circular</a></span>&nbsp;</span>and the&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/News/News-Release/2025/250221news/New-SSF-Structure-Infosheet-Feb-2025-EN.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">information sheet</a></span></span>&nbsp;published today for details of the enhancements to the securities market stock settlement fee structure. Amendments will be also made to the General Rules of Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (HKSCC), and will be updated in due course.</p>

<p>The FSB is committed to promoting implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s Global Regulatory framework for crypto-assets and engaging beyond G-20 jurisdictions.</p>
</blockquote>
</header>
<section class="post-content">
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is seeking feedback from stakeholders as part of its thematic peer review on the implementation of its global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities. The framework consists of two sets of high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of (i) crypto-asset activities and markets, and (ii) &ldquo;global stablecoin&rdquo; arrangements.</p>
<p>The objective of the review is to examine progress made by FSB member and select non-member jurisdictions in implementing the FSB&rsquo;s global regulatory framework, including any lessons learnt. The&nbsp;Summary Terms of Reference [link]&nbsp;provides more details on the objectives, scope, and process for this review.</p>
<p>The FSB has distributed a questionnaire to relevant jurisdictions to collect information. In addition, as part of this peer review, the FSB invites feedback from stakeholders on the following issues:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Impact of jurisdictional regulatory frameworks on decisions of crypto-asset issuers and service providers (including stablecoin arrangements) to locate and structure their business.</li>
<li>Experiences and challenges faced by crypto-asset market participants to meet the relevant regulatory and supervisory requirements.</li>
<li>How financial stability vulnerabilities of crypto asset activities, including stablecoins, differ across jurisdictions (e.g. based on the scale and materiality of the adoption of services) and how vulnerabilities are evolving (e.g. in type or magnitude) as jurisdictions implement relevant regulatory and supervisory frameworks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Whether there are specific market practices and/or trends in certain geographies and/or segments that may pose a threat to financial stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback should be submitted by 28 March 2025 to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:fsb@fsb.org">fsb@fsb.org</a>&nbsp;under the subject heading &ldquo;FSB Thematic Peer Review on global crypto&rdquo;.

<p>NZX today announced Group operating earnings (EBITDA) of $48.5 million (excluding integration and restructure costs) for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 &ndash; up 21%. Including integration and restructure costs, reported Group operating earnings (EBITDA) for the same period were $47.2 million &ndash; up 21.3%.</p>

<p><br clear="ALL" /> &ldquo;NZX continued to experience positive momentum towards achieving its strategic goals, due to the diversified nature of the Company&rsquo;s activities and the strong growth opportunities in front of us,&rdquo; NZX Board Chair John McMahon says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For local markets, capital markets issuance and trading activity grew steadily throughout 2024. As interest rates began to fall, NZX saw a meaningful pick-up in capital markets activity in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition, asset prices were stronger both locally and globally through the year and, alongside solid growth in Smart&rsquo;s funds under management and NZX Wealth Technologies&rsquo; fund under administration, this has translated to strong results across the Group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pleasing result demonstrating NZX&rsquo;s all-round business strength as a market operator, fund manager and fund administration platform provider &ndash; especially with NZX Wealth Technologies reaching positive cashflow from its external client activities in December.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a Group level, growth was reflected by operating revenue increasing by 11.4% to $120.8 million, driven by increases in all business units.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operating expenses, excluding integration and restructure costs, were up 5.8% to $72.2 million. This was driven by an inflation and exchange rate-driven lift in IT costs and a cost structure change to Smart (previously known as Smartshares).</p>
<p>NZX produced an audited net profit after tax (NPAT) of $25.5 million, an increase of 88.1% from 2023. Excluding the accounting adjustments to the fair value of the QuayStreet Asset Management earnout provision and the Electricity Authority contract&rsquo;s intangible asset, the underlying net profit after tax was $18.3 million, an increase of 30.1% year-on-year.</p>
<p>NZX Chief Executive Mark Peterson says stimulating New Zealand market activity to enable growth was a significant focus for NZX in 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NZX &ndash; and a small capital markets industry group &ndash; worked closely with the New Zealand Government and regulators to develop appropriate initiatives and market regulatory settings that will encourage investment, boost liquidity, and continue to ensure fair, efficient, and transparent capital markets,&rdquo; Mr Peterson says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was pleasing to see the Government announce a package of intended reforms in December 2024 that acknowledge that healthy and well-functioning New Zealand capital markets are essential to lifting our country&rsquo;s productivity and international competitiveness.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NZX/S&amp;P 50 index (gross) produced a return of 11.4% for 2024. Capital listed and raised totalled $15.8 billion &ndash; up 11.6% on 2023.&nbsp; Total value traded grew strongly in H2 2024 and was positively impacted by significant index rebalance activity and the Auckland Council sell down of its remaining shares in Auckland International Airport.&nbsp; Value traded finished the year totalling $41.5 billion &ndash;up 22.9% on 2023.&nbsp; This was NZX&rsquo;s third-highest result ever.</p>
<p>Mr Peterson says even through the challenging economic environment, the market was able to support companies raising equity and debt capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This highlights the value of being NZX-listed in a capital constrained environment. Expectations are for this positive momentum to continue into 2025 as confidence in the global and local economies continue to build,&rdquo; Mr Peterson says.</p>
<p>Additional NZX Group highlights for 2024 include:</p>
<p>▪&nbsp; Delivery of NZX Dark &ndash; the new anonymous mid-point trading venue: launched in June 2024, 5.24% of on-market value traded was achieved within six months of launch &ndash; well above expectations of 2% after 12 months of trading</p>
<p>▪&nbsp; Dairy market derivatives partnership with Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) &ndash; saw continued volume growth for lots traded of 15.3% and, in May 2024, a record monthly volume of 88,834 traded lots was achieved</p>
<p>▪&nbsp; Smart finished 2024 with $13.5 billion in funds under management (FUM) &ndash; up 22.6% from 2023. In the last six years Smart&rsquo;s FUM has grown $10.6 billion. It was rebranded Smart in October 2024 to reflect its growth ambitions and the broad range of products and services it now offers</p>
<p>▪&nbsp; NZXWT achieved positive cashflow from its external client activities in December. In 2024 it won 12 new clients (22 in the last two years) and transitioned 11 clients on to its platform. In 2024 its funds under administration (FUA) grew by 40.4% ($4.7 billion). Since 2018, FUA has grown from $2 billion to $16.2 billion.</p>
<p>In market development, work is progressing on a relaunch of the S&amp;P/NZX 20 Index Futures later in H1 2025. The launch date depends on a number of factors, including regulatory approvals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A liquid equity derivatives market will help drive growth in the broader New Zealand capital markets through additional cash market trading, participation and data revenues,&rdquo; Mr Peterson says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our results demonstrate that NZX is now a more integrated and resilient financial markets infrastructure and services business with a platform for strong growth prospects. We expect this to create further value to our shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Peterson says a critical role for NZX is to operate the markets efficiently and effectively, which requires ongoing investment in technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was pleasing that 2024 is the third year in a row where NZX maintained 100% uptime for its critical applications with no market outages to the operating platform. This is a credit to the operational management of the senior leadership team and the entire technology team. It also highlights the resilience, capability and capacity of our systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The performance of NZX in meeting its market operator obligations, including its technology and relationships with the market, continued to be positively noted by the Financial Market Authority in its latest annual review of NZX published in June 2024.</p>
<p>The NZX Board has declared a fully imputed final dividend of 3.1 cents per share (2023: 3.1 cents) to be paid on 2 April 2025 to shareholders registered as at the record date of 19 March 2025. Total dividends for the 2024 Financial Year are 6.1 cents per share fully imputed (2023: 6.1 cents).</p>
<p>NZX is forecasting full year 2025 operating earnings (excluding integration and restructuring costs) to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million. The guidance is subject to the usual market risks and outcomes.</p>

<p>Leading financial services trade associations voiced strong support today for the goals of the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The organizations include the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Americas Focus Committee of the Association of Global Custodians, Financial Services Forum, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and The Clearing House Association. In a joint letter, the Associations propose recommendations to bolster U.S. leadership in digital assets by removing obstacles to bank engagement with digital asset activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We strongly support the President&rsquo;s goals for the PWG, and we stand ready to assist you as you proceed with the work plan outlined by the President in his January 23rd Executive Order,&rdquo; the Associations wrote. &ldquo;The federal banking agencies&rsquo; policies and guidance issued over the last few years regarding digital assets activities have hindered banks&rsquo; ability to engage in those activities, and, in turn, the competitiveness of the United States financial system, as non-U.S. firms are not subject to similar requirements. Simply put, the United States will not be able to achieve a leadership position in digital assets and financial technology under the status quo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The recommendations call for several policy statements and guidance documents issued by the federal banking agencies to be rescinded or substantially revised. These policies restrain banks&rsquo; ability to engage in virtually any digital asset-related activity, including offering custody and safekeeping services for digital assets, facilitating customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets, holding crypto-assets on their balance sheets or leveraging public blockchains.</p>
<p>The letter also encourages the Working Group to include the prudential banking agencies &mdash; the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency &mdash; in its ongoing work. Involvement by the banking agencies would help ensure that banks can participate in digital asset activities and, thereby, advance U.S. leadership in the digital assets ecosystem in furtherance of the goal of the Executive Order.</p>
<p><span>Policies and guidance identified that should be rescinded or substantially revised include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Federal Reserve</span> 
<ul>
<li>SR 22-6, &ldquo;Engagement in Crypto-Asset-Related Activities by Federal Reserve Supervised Banks&rdquo;</li>
<li>Policy Statement on Section 9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act</li>
<li>SR 23-7, &ldquo;Creation of a Novel Activities Supervision Program&rdquo;</li>
<li>SR 23-8, &ldquo;Supervisory Nonobjection Process for State Member Banks Seeking to Engage in Certain Activities Involving Dollar Tokens&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>OCC</span> 
<ul>
<li>Interpretive Letter #1179, &ldquo;Chief Counsel&rsquo;s Interpretation Clarifying: (1) Authority of a Bank to Engage in Certain Cryptocurrency Activities; and (2) Authority of the OCC to Charter a National Trust Bank&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>FDIC</span> 
<ul>
<li>FIL-16-2022, &ldquo;Notification of Engaging in Crypto-Related Activities&rdquo;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Tom, and thank you for the invitation to give the Whittington Lecture.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is humbling to be here giving this lecture to honor the memory and legacy of Leslie Whittington. While I did not cross paths with Leslie here at Georgetown University, when I arrived, I heard so many stories about her contributions to the school, the university, and the students. She worked on research about the effects of economic policies on children and families, so I know that if I had had the good fortune to overlap with her as a colleague, I would have benefited greatly from her work and presence. It is also an honor to be giving this lecture, because so many dynamic leaders have previously stood before you, including some who have been inspirations to me in my career, such as Alice Rivlin and Cecilia Rouse.</p>
<p>Today I will be discussing a topic that has certainly captured the attention of central bankers, and the public at large, in recent years: inflation and the relationship between inflation and unemployment. But before I talk about a lens through which to think about the inflation experienced in the pandemic period, I want to update you with my views on the current outlook for the U.S. economy and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) efforts to sustainably return inflation to our 2 percent objective while maintaining a strong labor market.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />The overall picture is that the U.S. economy remains on a firm footing, with output growing at a solid pace. Real gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent in 2024. Consumer spending continued to drive this solid pace last year. While retail sales posted a decline last month, January data are often difficult to interpret. Bad weather and seasonal adjustment difficulties may have affected the release, and it should be noted the slowdown came after a strong pace of sales in the second half of last year. That said, as usual, I pay attention to many indicators to gauge the state of the economy. Employment readings show that the labor market is healthy and stable. Payroll job gains have been solid recently, averaging 189,000 per month over the past four months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). After touching 4.2 percent as recently as November, the unemployment rate has flattened to 4 percent since then, consistent with a labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.</p>
<p>Inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, though the path continues to be bumpy and inflation remains somewhat elevated. Readings last week from the BLS showed price pressures persisted in the economy in January. Our preferred inflation gauge at the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, will be released next week. Based on the consumer price index and producer price index data for January, it is estimated that the PCE index advanced about 2.4 percent on a 12-month basis in January. Excluding food and energy costs, core prices are estimated to have risen 2.6 percent. Those readings show there is still some way to go before achieving the FOMC's 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>Regarding monetary policy, the FOMC judged in September that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels that were strongly restrictive on aggregate demand and putting downward pressure on inflation. We reduced that rate 100 basis points through December, leaving our policy rate at moderately restrictive levels. At our latest meeting in January, I supported the decision to hold the policy rate steady. I see this as appropriate, given that the downward risks to employment have diminished but upside risks to inflation remain. The potential net effect of new economic policies also remains highly uncertain and will depend on the breadth, duration, reactions to, and, importantly, specifics of the measures adopted.</p>
<p>Going forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess the incoming data and evolving outlook.</p>
<p>Now, turning back to the main topic of my speech, I will start with the core mission of the Federal Reserve: to pursue the dual mandate, given to us by Congress, of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. We saw firsthand during the pandemic period why the price-stability portion of the mandate is so important. High inflation imposes significant hardship and erodes Americans' purchasing power, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. As a policymaker and economist, I think it is vitally important to have a good understanding of inflation dynamics and how those dynamics may have evolved over time. This knowledge allows me to pursue the best policies to deliver stable prices while maintaining a solid labor market.</p>
<p><strong>Waves of Inflation</strong><br />Five years after the pandemic took hold suddenly and with little warning, there is a tendency to remember the inflation buildup as a fast and uniform phenomenon. But that was not the case. Inflation stemming from the pandemic shock came in waves. Today I will first describe the different waves of inflation experienced in the pandemic period. Then I invite you aboard the sailboat that we will use to navigate those waves: You could call it the SS&nbsp;<em>Phillips Curve.</em>&nbsp;The Phillips curve is a model that has been used for a long time to try to explain inflation dynamics and the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. Finally, I will discuss with you how this voyage may have changed the charts for policymakers.</p>
<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S., and much of the world's developed economies, experienced a prolonged period of low inflation. Then, when the economy broadly shut down in March and April 2020, the U.S. experienced a brief period of deflation. But by the middle of that year, we saw that the first of several waves of inflation began hitting the economy's shores.</p>
<p>The first notable wave of inflation came from food prices. With many restaurants closed and people fearful of gathering, consumers pivoted their spending to grocery stores and online grocery delivery to meet their families' needs, with some stockpiling essential items because they feared future shortages. This jump in demand was met with snarled supply chains for food processing and groceries. Annual food inflation reached a first peak of 5 percent in June 2020. There was a second food inflation wave with the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the middle of 2022. Beyond the cost alone, grocery prices are an important determinant of inflation expectations for consumers since food is purchased so frequently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Another wave of inflation came from goods other than food and energy&mdash;what economists call "core goods." In the years immediately before the pandemic, goods prices were not a significant source of inflation. During the expansion from 2009 until 2020, core goods inflation declined 0.5 percent annually on average. However, once the pandemic took hold, consumer demand rotated from services to goods. At the same time, additional supply chain issues arose, including closed factories and disrupted ports. As consumption rapidly shifted toward goods, their prices rose sharply.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Core goods inflation picked up markedly in the spring of 2021 and reached a peak of 7.6 percent on a 12-month basis in February 2022. This was a notable development because, during most of this century, goods price deflation offset price increases in other categories and thus kept a lid on overall inflation.</p>
<p>A third wave of inflation came from services costs, excluding housing. Near the start of the pandemic, millions of Americans lost their jobs, and many left the labor market, with some retiring and others fearful of being exposed to the virus. When the economy began to reopen from shutdowns, demand for workers rose faster than the supply. As a result, the labor market quickly became very tight. To attract workers, employers raised wages. And to offset that expense, many raised prices. Given that labor is the most important input into the production of services, core services inflation ensued, reaching a peak of 5.2 percent on a 12-month basis in December 2021. Core services inflation stayed persistently high until it began to turn down in February 2023.</p>
<p>The final wave of inflation I will discuss came from PCE housing services inflation. During the pandemic, many Americans reassessed housing choices, including those who preferred to move to detached homes in the suburbs from multifamily dwellings in cities. The supply of housing has long been constrained, so when a further increase in demand met limited supply, prices rose. Housing inflation rose to a peak of 8.27 percent on a 12-month basis in April 2023 and has moved lower since then. The run-up in housing inflation came more slowly, but it is also the component most slowly to abate. This is an area that experienced catch-up inflation, as housing inflation rises and falls slowly because rents are reset infrequently, usually only once a year for most renters.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this discussion, I will focus on core inflation, and specifically core goods and core services inflation. My objective is to discuss several additions to an augmented Phillips curve model that allow us to capture the dynamics of those waves we encountered on our journey.</p>
<p><strong>The Traditional Phillips Curve</strong><br />Since price stability and maximum employment are the two components of the Fed's dual-mandate goal, it is important for policymakers to be able to interpret the inflation process and relate it to macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment. One traditional way of understanding the usual tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is the use of the Phillips curve. It was first employed by New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips in 1958 to describe a simple relationship between wage growth and unemployment. Basically, it demonstrates that wage inflation is lower when unemployment is high, and higher when unemployment is low. Since then, several variants and updates have been offered to the Phillips curve model, and I will offer updates, too.</p>
<p>One of the most notable updates came from Milton Friedman in 1967 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;In that speech, he argued that there is only a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, because inflation depends on both the unemployment rate relative to a natural rate (the unemployment gap) and expectations of future inflation.</p>
<p>The unemployment gap measures how much unemployment is above or below some reference level such as the natural rate of unemployment, or NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), which is thought to be the normal level of unemployment absent cyclical forces. An unemployment rate that is above the reference level<em>&nbsp;</em>indicates that there is slack in the economy. Conversely, if the unemployment rate is below the reference level, the economy is tight. The unemployment gap has an inverse relation to wage and price inflation, because slack in the economy means that there are excess resources to meet demand while tightness in the labor market means there is little room to expand demand without putting upward pressure on prices. Let's turn now to the other ingredient in Friedman's Phillips curve: inflation expectations. Inflation expectations represent the rate at which people expect prices to rise in the future. A Phillips curve model that includes inflation expectations is called an "expectations-augmented Phillips curve."</p>
<p>The idea behind adding inflation expectations to a Phillips curve is that workers care about their inflation-adjusted wage, rather than nominal wages, over the course of a period of employment when bargaining their pay. Meanwhile, price-setting firms care about their relative price in pricing their products. Both sets of agents must forecast as best as possible the future path of inflation to efficiently bargain their wages or set their prices. In other words, both parties form expectations about the general price level, and these expectations will feed back into the inflation process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Friedman assumed that inflation expectations respond to lagged observed inflation&mdash;or what are called "adaptive expectations"&mdash;and when that is so, it provides a mechanism for inflation to be persistent.</p>
<p>This view captured inflation dynamics in the 1970s and early 1980s fairly well; however, it was not broadly applicable to the period from the late 1980s through 2019, often called the "Great Moderation." Rather, regarding inflation dynamics over an extended period, inflation appears to be more strongly related to long-run inflation expectations than to lagged inflation or short-run inflation expectations measures. Monetary policy can play an important role in setting long-run inflation expectations. Both wage seekers and price setters form their inflation expectations, in part, from their beliefs about the central bank's inflation goal. When long-run inflation expectations stay close to the central bank's goal, we say that inflation expectations are anchored at that goal. That goal is currently set at 2 percent, and long-run inflation expectations have indeed been in a tight range around that target.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>The empirical literature on the Phillips curve has considered additional variables that may affect inflation and used those variables to create new versions of a Phillips curve. For example, Phillips curves have long included measures of "cost-push" pressures such as core import prices. These cost pressures more fully capture shocks to firms' costs coming from global price pressures and not captured by other measures of slack. Other Phillips curves also include lags of inflation to capture persistence in the inflation process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>To summarize, the empirical literature has come to the conclusion that inflation dynamics can best be captured by a Phillips curve that includes lags of inflation, long-run inflation expectations, and a measure of slack, as well as import and energy prices as cost-push shocks. An instance of that formulation of a Phillips curve is included in former Chair Janet Yellen's speech from 2015.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Next, I would like to assess the accuracy of this baseline model during the recent run-up of inflation and consider how to augment the Phillips curve model with some new variables that may be able to capture some of the shocks experienced during the pandemic and post-pandemic period. A large literature has emerged on how to interpret the recent run-up in inflation, and more research is needed to fully understand this complicated episode. The Phillips curve model that I will use is another approach to consider. This is a simple approach, but it is possible to consider more complex models, such as models that consider the joint dynamics of inflation and other variables or models that explicitly consider nonlinearities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;However, I still see value in starting from this simple framework, seeing what it can and cannot explain about pandemic inflation, and then seeing whether the addition of certain variables can help the model more fully account for inflation during the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Estimation of the Phillips Curve Today</strong><br />As I just explained, the Phillips curve model allows flexibility in the choice of variables, but economists employing the model must decide how to weight these variables. And those weights must be chosen in some way. Economists choose weights by examining available data and deciding which capture the inflation process in the best possible way. This decision is called "estimation." The modern way to undertake such an estimation is called "training." Economists train a model on a specific set of data and consider different cuts of the data set to determine different ways to compute those weights.</p>
<p>I will consider quarterly data that have been consistently produced since 1964, allowing us to include the periods of the Great Inflation, the Great Moderation, and the most recent inflation run-up. We could use this entire data set to train the model. However, subsample analysis also serves to prove some valuable points.</p>
<p><strong>First Result: Examining the Great Moderation</strong><br />Let's start by updating former Fed Chair Yellen's results. She estimated the model using the data during the so-called Great Moderation; I will update her results by training the model through 2019, the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the U.S. As the term "moderation" implies, this was a period in which both inflation and output became much less volatile. We do not know exactly what brought about the Great Moderation. Hypotheses include the effects of better inventory management or better monetary policy. We do know, however, that inflation settled into a trend near to or slightly below 2 percent during that period. We estimate the model with data from this period, and we decompose how much of inflation is explained by the variables and how much is left unexplained, which economists call the "residual." As it turns out, this model does a good job of capturing the inflation process over that period before the pandemic, and my results are similar to Yellen's. The model explains 70 percent of the variation in inflation, meaning that only 30 percent of the variation in inflation is attributed to unexplained residuals. An alternative way to understand the unexplained part is as the standard deviation of the residual or the unexplained portion of the model, which was 0.50 percentage point for the period from 2010 to 2019, compared with the standard deviation of inflation of about 0.8 percentage point.</p>
<p>This model, however, struggles to explain the run-up in inflation in the years immediately after the pandemic took hold. The unexplained portion of inflation, the residual, rises dramatically in 2021 and 2022. In 2021, the unexplained portion is almost 2 percentage points, and the following year, it is about 1.5 percentage points. Perhaps we should not be surprised by the outcome. These years saw inflation reach a four-decade peak, but the model has been trained on a Great Moderation sample that saw relatively quiet inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p><strong>Second Result: Using a Longer Sample</strong><br />The results are more encouraging if, instead, we also include data from the previous period of significant inflation and train the model on data starting in 1964. Intuitively, it makes sense that including a period with persistent inflation, like the 1970s, might help us better understand another inflationary episode. I stop at 2019 because I want to see if training on data from the previous 55-year period can explain the post-2020 inflation.</p>
<p>The model captures more of the most recent run-up in inflation when using the longer period of analysis. The unexplained residual drops to about 1.5 percentage points in 2021 and to a bit above 0.5 percentage point in 2022. Allowing for greater persistence in inflation allows an inflation equation to fit the pandemic period better, though it does not settle the question of whether the pandemic inflation was caused by large and persistent shocks or by large shocks and a persistent inflation process&mdash;for example, because of greater feedback between wages and prices.</p>
<p>To improve the model further, it would be useful to include additional explanatory variables that could better capture the overheating of the economy. In what follows, I include variables that might account for factors experienced in the most recent bout of inflation, such as a very tight labor market and supply chain snarls.</p>
<p><strong>Third Result: Alternative Measure of Slack</strong><br />As I mentioned before, the very tight labor market was an important contributor to inflation in recent years, especially to services inflation, yet the weight on the unemployment gap in the Phillips curve for the more recent period is very small. This measure of slack has become less and less important over time in explaining inflation, except during selected episodes such as in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, which was characterized by a very sluggish recovery. Outside of that episode, and very few others, the Phillips curve places little weight on that measure of slack in explaining inflation over the Great Moderation, including during the recent run-up. This is also a reflection of training the model over the Great Moderation, in which inflation moved fairly tightly around a very flat trend. Notice that this would suggest a "flat Phillips curve" or a big penalty in terms of unemployment needed to reduce inflation. Instead, I focus on another very promising alternative measure that I have paid a lot of attention to since I was chief economist at the Department of Labor&mdash;and again since I joined the Board of Governors&mdash;and that I am very familiar with as a scholar of labor markets. The measure is the ratio of vacancies to the level of unemployment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;In effect, this ratio measures how much competition there is for a given job, or the "tightness" of the labor market. Labor is an important input into most production processes, and, thus, tightness in the labor market is closely related to price pressures. I use the standard version of this ratio that measures job openings from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey as the numerator and the unemployment level from the Current Population Survey as the denominator. This allows me to use data back to the 1960s.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;The vacancy-to-unemployment ratio as a measure of slack is more effective at explaining inflation than the unemployment gap. This represents an interesting result because it offers a larger role to heated labor markets in explaining the run-up in inflation. My results echo research that finds the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is a helpful measure of slack to consider in out-of-sample forecasting exercises.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p><strong>Fourth Result: Supply Chain Snarls</strong><br />Although the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio offers a promising measure of slack and supply chain pressures due to labor shortages, that measure does not necessarily capture supply chain snarls whose roots lie outside of the labor market. As I mentioned earlier, there were substantial supply chain disruptions during the past few years that came at the same time as strong demand. That resulted in material and labor shortages. Attempts at quantifying supply-side disruptions have been around for some decades now.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;I rely on a new monthly shortages index created by a team of Fed Board economists, which relies on textual analysis to scan news articles for sentences that include the word pairs "labor shortages," "material shortages," or "food shortages."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;The Shortage Index allows us to better measure cost-push pressures from different sources and is constructed all the way back to the beginning of the previous century. Thus, it makes a difference to have access to advances in natural language processing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;When I add the Shortage Index to the baseline Phillips curve or to the vacancy-to-unemployment&ndash;based Phillips curve, I obtain that the Shortage Index explains an even larger portion of the inflation run-up during and after the pandemic. The residual for 2020 is cut in half, the residual for 2021 is about 1 percentage point, and the residual is effectively eliminated in 2022. I judge this a noteworthy result and a proof of concept that with additional augmentation, the Phillips curve model can better capture inflation dynamics during the recent period. Through the lens of this model, supply shortages played an important role in 2022 in constraining output to grow at an anemic rate and in pushing up inflation. Moreover, the model is also able to capture the decline in inflation in 2023 and 2024 despite the strong expansion in real activity. I view the Shortage Index as a powerful indicator of the nonlinear effects stemming from a compounding of the contemporaneous interaction of demand and supply bottlenecks.</p>
<p>I have offered additional variables to account for a measure of slack as it relates to labor supply and material supply. This exercise could be extended further to better account for some of the subcategories of inflation that caused the waves I discussed earlier. For example, food inflation, which is characterized by two distinct waves, can mostly be explained by the Food Shortage Index, which captures a large portion of the residual in the baseline model.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons for the Policymaker</strong><br />Today I have discussed the waves of inflation the country faced starting five years ago. I also talked about how the vessel we use to navigate those choppy waters can be improved upon. As I conclude, I want to discuss with you how central bankers might recalibrate their compasses, based on what we learned from considering these augmentations to Phillips curve models. I think a clear lesson is that no single model alone can give a policymaker an understanding of every possible state of the economy. Policymakers must be open to various options, models, and frameworks&mdash;and not be afraid to experiment in search of more accurate answers. Policymakers must be very attentive to the most recent contributions from academia and empirical practitioners. Broadly, that is the approach I take, and why I apply the same rigor I did as an academic researcher to the monetary policy decisions that I confront.</p>
<p>The recent run-up in inflation in many ways was a rather unique period, spurred, at least initially, by the first onset of a global pandemic in more than a century. Fully understanding the dynamics at play has provided a tough test for economists. The models I described today have had some success in capturing salient features of the inflation process during the pandemic period. I hope this illustrative analysis helps you see the difficulties of forecasting inflation in real time.</p>
<p>Another lesson to be learned from this experience is that the feared harsh tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, one that requires large costs in terms of job loss and reduction in incomes in order to reduce inflation, did not materialize in the years immediately after the 2022 inflation peak. Inflation has been significantly reduced while the labor market has remained solid. This is a historically unusual, but most welcome, outcome. While this outcome is in part due to the actions of Fed policymakers, it is also possible to explain that remarkable result through the lens of the models that I have presented today. A large fraction of the rise in inflation, most specifically core goods inflation, can be explained by supply chain snarls. The untangling of supply chains contributed to a decline in inflation with little cost in terms of unemployment. Likewise, labor markets were very tight in this period. As workers returned to the labor force, labor markets became less tight, and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio declined. That corresponded with a subsequent decline in inflation. That is a consistent result because services inflation is closely connected to the cost of labor.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today. Once again, it is humbling to be asked to give the Whittington Lecture to honor the memory of fellow educator Leslie Whittington. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. D'Acunto, Malmendier, Ospina, and Weber (2021) show that consumers disproportionately rely on the price changes of goods in their grocery bundles when forming expectations about aggregate inflation; see Francesco D'Acunto, Ulrike Malmendier, Juan Ospina, and Michael Weber (2021), "Exposure to Grocery Prices and Inflation Expectations,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Political Economy,</em>&nbsp;vol. 129 (May), pp. 1615&ndash;39.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f2"></a></p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Ferrante, Graves, and Iacoviello (2020) show that a sharp reallocation of demand from one sector to another can exacerbate supply chain disruption and cause aggregate inflation; see Francesco Ferrante, Sebastian Graves, and Matteo Iacoviello (2023), "The Inflationary Effects of&nbsp;Sectoral Reallocation,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Monetary Economics,</em>&nbsp;supp., vol. 140 (November), pp. S64&ndash;81.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f3"></a></p>

<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Friedman did not consider forward-looking price-setting firms, but more recent advances in macroeconomics do, such as New Keynesian models; see Jordi Gal&iacute; (2015),&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework and Its Applications</em>&nbsp;(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f5"></a></p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. In an earlier speech, I have sketched a model in which agents infer the central bank target by observing inflation, interest rates, and unemployment data; see Adriana D. Kugler (2024), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241114a.htm">Central Bank Independence and the Conduct of Monetary Policy</a>," speech delivered at the Albert Hirschman Lecture, 2024 Annual Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association and the Latin American and Caribbean Chapter of the Econometric Society, Montevideo, Uruguay, November 14.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f6"></a></p>

<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. The model that I will use is similar to the one described by Janet Yellen in her famous speech at the University of Massachusetts in 2015; see Janet L. Yellen (2015), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20150924a.htm">Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy</a>," speech delivered at the Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, September 24.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f8"></a></p>

<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. The results that I obtain for the 1990&ndash;2019 period are similar to those that Yellen reports for the 1990&ndash;2014 period.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f10"></a></p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. The ratio of job openings to unemployment has attracted the attention of many researchers. See, for instance, Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S.

<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. Although job openings from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) go back only as far as the early 2000s, I use here the extended series from Barnichon that pieces together JOLTS data for the more recent period with a corrected version of the help-wanted index originally from the Conference Board for the period before 2001. See Regis Barnichon (2010), "Building a Composite Help-Wanted Index,"&nbsp;<em>Economics Letters,</em>&nbsp;vol. 109 (December), pp. 175&ndash;78.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250220a.htm#f12"></a></p>

<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. Other authors have used natural language processing in an attempt to produce a measure of shortages. For instance, see Paul E. Soto (2023), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/measurement-and-effects-of-supply-chain-bottlenecks-using-natural-language-processing-20230206.html">Measurement and Effects of Supply Chain Bottlenecks Using Natural Language Processing</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 6). Blanchard and Bernanke use Google searches for the word "shortage" as an indicator of sectoral supply constraints in a Phillips curve equation; see Blanchard and Bernanke, "What Caused the US Pandemic-Era Inflation?" in note 11. For an early-attempt, hand-coded shortage index, see Owen Lamont (1997), "Do 'Shortages' Cause Inflation?" in Christina D. Romer and David H.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the Association of Securities and Exchange Commission Alumni (ASECA) for organizing today&rsquo;s event in tribute to Judge Stanley Sporkin, the Commission&rsquo;s first Director of Enforcement. It is an honor to kick off this event featuring a panel of former SEC Directors of Enforcement who have followed in his footsteps. My remarks today reflect my views as Acting Chairman and I am not speaking on behalf of the Commission or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>I also thank John Hartigan for the invitation to provide opening remarks. I have known John since the late 1990s from my days in private practice as a corporate and securities lawyer in Los Angeles. Both of us were members of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and helped organize their annual securities regulation seminar. A highlight of each seminar was the panel featuring Judge Sporkin, who participated nearly every year. It was always entertaining, thought-provoking, and informative. It was a privilege to personally listen to his wisdom and observations.</p>
<p>Judge Sporkin served as the Director of Enforcement from 1974 to 1981. He saw enormous changes in technology and the financial markets during his time at the SEC, and later as a federal judge.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, Judge Sporkin said, &ldquo;I cannot recall any period in the past where change has been so dramatic and rapid. What we are seeing is literally happening before our eyes.&rdquo;[1] He held up the typewriter as one example of the demise of entire products and industries, before observing that the changes &ldquo;so permeate our society that they will have a substantial impact on the future structure and performance of our financial markets.&rdquo;[2]</p>
<p>Sitting here today, it might be hard to imagine how the demise of the typewriter could have an impact on financial markets. But back then, it was just one of many changes happening all at once. If you look at all the changes happening now, it&rsquo;s not so hard to imagine.</p>
<p>If Judge Sporkin wrote his remarks today, he might point to the invention of artificial intelligence or to cryptocurrencies and digital assets, instead of &ldquo;a gizmo called the word processor&rdquo;[3] as emblematic of the &ldquo;technological revolution&rdquo;[4] taking place. But the &ldquo;overall goal&rdquo;,[5] he articulated back then&mdash;that &ldquo;we should regulate only to assure that our markets are honest, fully competitive, and accessible to all&rdquo;[6]&mdash;still holds today.</p>
<p>An important objective of any financial regulator in protecting investors is to ferret out bad actors and foster the provision of information necessary to make informed investment decisions. Capital formation&mdash;a core SEC mission and one that is vital to our economy&mdash;cannot flourish in an environment rife with fraud and deceit. At the same time, any investment involves risk and we must avoid paternalistic regulation that presumes the government knows best. Or, as Judge Sporkin put it, &ldquo;We must permit access to the market place for new and budding enterprises with the minimum restraints. Whatever new forms of regulation are considered, they must be examined in the context of an evolving society designed to be driven by the innovation of the private sector and not an impediment to it. We must make sure that the creativity of our brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs is not stifled by suffocating regulation.&rdquo;[6]</p>
<p>Since its creation in 1972, the Division of Enforcement has played a vital role in the Commission&rsquo;s ability to advance its three-part mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation. That mission plays a key role in promoting innovation, jobs creation, and the American Dream. The work of the Division is key to ensuring that markets are honest, that market forces&mdash;not manipulative ones&mdash;determine the price of securities, and that we protect investors from fraud and deceit.</p>
<p>I have been a securities regulator for more than twenty years &ndash; first at the state level and then at the SEC. Like many of you, I have seen firsthand about the harm that fraud can have on investors, who may lose their entire life savings from deceitful schemes. Time and time again, bad actors have leveraged the prospect of technological innovation to defraud others.</p>
<p>Take innovation involving artificial intelligence (AI). More market participants are using AI in their businesses. More sophisticated investors are using AI tools to help them make investment decisions. More retail investors are seeking out investment opportunities to capitalize on the growth of AI. And&mdash;as with other technological innovations&mdash;we&rsquo;ve seen how bad actors can capitalize on that increased use and interest by offering investment opportunities with false statements or exaggerations about AI capabilities. Thanks to the hard work of the Division, the Commission has brought several enforcement actions to protect investors from such bad actors.[7]</p>
<p>Judge Sporkin understood that SEC enforcement efforts must support broader policymaking and regulatory efforts of the Commission. In the crypto asset space, last month, I announced the formation of a new crypto task force dedicated to developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets.[8] One focus of this task force will be to ensure that we deploy enforcement resources judiciously.[9] The SEC is fully engaged in enforcement efforts against fraud and schemes in all areas, including crypto.</p>
<p>To keep pace with innovation, we have formed a new unit within the Division of Enforcement: the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. This new unit will ensure that the Division remains nimble and stays on the cutting edge of technological developments to better fulfill our investor protection mission and hold accountable bad actors who use innovation to defraud others.</p>
<p>We remain dedicated to our more traditional investor protection efforts. Take elder fraud, for example. The prospect or reality of losing one&rsquo;s life savings is devastating. This is especially in the case of a retiree or a worker in the twilight of their career. Too many bad actors have targeted senior citizens and the retirement savings they have amassed over a lifetime of hard work. Thanks to the Division&rsquo;s efforts, the Commission has brought numerous enforcement cases alleging fraud and other wrongdoing involving elder investors.[10] The Division and Commission will continue to vigorously pursue bad actors who target senior citizens.</p>
<p>Make no mistake&mdash;the Division and Commission will continue to hold wrongdoers accountable, just as they did fifty years ago when Judge Sporkin stepped into the Director&rsquo;s role.</p>
<p>His legacy and leadership continue to inspire the Division and the Commission. It is an honor to celebrate his legacy with you. Thank you.</p>

<title>Risks And Challenges For Bank Regulation And Supervision, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michael S. Barr, At Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Banks play an indispensable role in an economy that works for everyone.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;They enable households to borrow to buy a home, save for the future, and deal with the ups and downs of managing finances. Banks provide the credit for businesses to smooth out income and expenses, supply capital to seize new opportunities and create jobs, and facilitate the flow of payments that are the lifeblood of our economy. And banks borrow from households and businesses as well, such as through federally insured deposits. Because of these vital roles, we need to make sure that banks are resilient and serve as a source of strength to the economy in both good times and when the financial system comes under stress. In our market economy, like any business, banks compete with each other and pursue profits by balancing risk-taking with safety and soundness. But because of the key role banks play in the economy, and the fact that banks do not fully internalize the costs of their own failure, regulation and supervision must ensure that banks do not take on excessive risks that can cause widespread harm to households and businesses.</p>
<p>Bank failures are as old as banking, and we've seen repeated waves of bank failures over the centuries. America learned that hard lesson nearly 100 years ago, when bank failures played a central role in the Great Depression. In response, the United States&mdash;and many other countries around the globe&mdash;set up a system of deposit insurance and enabled emergency lending in times of stress. To balance the moral hazard of the federal safety net, Congress established a framework of regulation and supervision to make it more likely that banks internalize the costs to society of their risk-taking.</p>
<p>But finance is always evolving, and the buildup of new risks led to the banking crisis of the 1980s, and then to the Global Financial Crisis, with devastating consequences. Weaknesses that were revealed in regulation and supervision led to unprecedented and unpopular bailouts, and shuttered American businesses, devastated local communities with foreclosures, and millions of individuals lost their jobs and their livelihoods. Government responded in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and in regulatory reforms by significantly strengthening bank oversight to curb excessive risk-taking. The message from the American people was clear: risk-taking must be balanced with the overarching need to maintain a resilient banking system that can continue to play its crucial role for households and businesses in good times and in bad.</p>
<p>Another, perennial lesson from the history of bank regulation and supervision is that the job is never done, and that the constant evolution of finance means risks will also evolve. As Vice Chair for Supervision, I have recognized the need to approach this mission with humility, aware that I don't have all the answers or perfect foresight of where things can go wrong. Both regulators and banks are limited in our ability to comprehensively identify and measure risks. Our financial system is complex, interconnected, and evolving. We cannot fully appreciate how a specific vulnerability can interact with other vulnerabilities to amplify and propagate risk in the face of shocks, let alone accurately anticipate shocks in time to avoid them.</p>
<p>When I became Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022, the Global Financial Crisis was almost 15 years past, and much had been done to strengthen the resilience of the system to reflect lessons learned. But in March 2023, we experienced the second largest bank failure in history, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the subsequent failures of Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. SVB's failure triggered stress throughout the system and required the issuance of a systemic risk exemption and the creation of an emergency bank lending program.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;We have made some progress toward addressing the gaps that led to the failures. But there will be headwinds that we must guard against in the coming years, as well as ongoing vulnerabilities and areas of risk that require continued vigilance.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I announced I would step down as Vice Chair for Supervision but remain a member of the Board of Governors. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as vice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength of the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of households and businesses. I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as governor. In this role, I'll continue to participate in monetary policy deliberations and vote on matters before the Board, including those related to supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>While it was a tough decision to make, I believe it was the right decision for the institution and, more importantly, for the public, whom we serve. The risk of a dispute over my position would be a distraction from our important mission. I feel strongly&mdash;as Chair Powell has said publicly many times&mdash;that the independence of the Federal Reserve is critical to our ability to meet our statutory mandates and serve the American public. Put simply, our mission is too important to let such a dispute distract from doing our job for the American people.</p>
<p>Since my term for Vice Chair for Supervision will end later this month, I'd like to use one of my last opportunities as Vice Chair to discuss seven specific risks ahead: (1) maintaining and finishing post-financial crisis reforms; (2) maintaining the credibility of the stress test; (3) maintaining credible, consistent supervision; (4) encouraging responsible innovation; (5) addressing cyber and third-party risk; (6) risks in the nonbank sector; and (7) climate risk. Each will continue to be a risk in either the near- or long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining and Finishing Post-Financial Crisis Reforms</strong><br />There is always push back on financial regulation. I felt that even in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, as I helped to draft the legislative response to that crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;And I felt that over the last few years as we worked to finish the job of post-crisis financial reform and take up evolving threats revealed from the latest bank stress. It is important to get the balance right, but it is also important to stand up for the American people.</p>
<p>I urge regulators to finish the job of implementing the final plank of the Global Financial Crisis reforms&mdash;and not to dismantle the hard-fought resilience that banks have built up in the process. Of course, there are always ways to increase efficiency and reform prior methods without costs to resiliency, and I support those efforts. But as I've spoken about many times, capital is critical to absorb losses and enable banks to continue operations through times of stress, and capital requirements should be aligned with the risks that banks take.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The Basel III endgame reforms include many improvements to how we measure credit, trading, operational, and derivatives risks in light of our experience in the Global Financial Crisis. All major jurisdictions except the United States have finalized rules that would implement these standards for their internationally active banks.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve played a central role in developing these standards in the many years before my arrival as Vice Chair. The Board sought comment on a proposal in July 2023 to implement the Basel III reforms, and we received a wide range of comments on the proposal.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;On the basis of those comments, I took steps last fall to outline broad and material changes that would better balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received and would result in a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;These reforms had broad consensus on the Board and the support of the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>
<p>When the U.S. provides leadership in international forums like Basel and then follows through, we set a powerful example and establish a standard that other jurisdictions also uphold. Implementing international standards enables U.S. firms to compete on a level playing field across the globe and makes the system safer. When we don't follow through on our commitments, for whatever reason, concerns about a level playing field rise in other jurisdictions, in an international "race to the bottom" on standards. This harms us all and makes U.S. banks less competitive. And unless the U.S. implements these standards, other jurisdictions will force U.S. banks operating abroad to meet their standards instead.</p>
<p>Let me turn to unfinished business from the March 2023 banking stress. In that event, we learned that bank runs and bank failures can happen fast, much faster than before. Before SVB, the largest bank to fail did so over a period of several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve has worked with banks to improve their ability to borrow from the discount window, and the financial system's collective readiness has improved significantly compared to pre-SVB, including with a substantial increase of $1 trillion in collateral pledged across the system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;The Federal Reserve has also worked to improve the functioning of the discount window, through a concerted effort to gather public input and identify areas for modernization. These efforts have improved the ability of banks to weather stress, both individually and collectively, which enhances financial stability.</p>
<p>However, there is still more work to do. For instance, banks, even the largest banks, are not currently required to establish a minimum level of readiness at the window, and, as a result, there are outlier firms that are not prepared for stress. This needs to change. Without a requirement there is also a significant risk of backtracking on the substantial progress in readiness we have made since March 2023.</p>
<p>Another important lesson from SVB is a classic one: balance sheet vulnerabilities among a group of institutions can be a source of contagion for the financial system and thus a key stability risk. While we did much to improve the resilience of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) in the past decade, March 2023 showed that significant systemic risks can develop and spread from stress anywhere in the system, including in large and regional banks that are not G-SIBs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>The resilience of these firms has improved as they have recognized their vulnerabilities, and we have worked through supervisory channels to encourage risk-management practices that put them on a firmer footing. But we also need to put in place more durable solutions to address risks. For one, the level of capital held by large banks needs to align with the underlying risks on their balance sheets. One important step would be to finalize the requirement that all large firms reflect unrealized losses on available for sale securities in their capital, which is a reform with broad agreement. This will help them manage interest rate risk before it gets to extreme levels, a significant problem revealed in the banking stress of two years ago.</p>
<p>Another lesson from the spring of 2023 is that large and regional banks&mdash;as well as G-SIBs&mdash;should ensure that they can actually monetize the securities on which they rely for their liquidity. Why does this matter? Banks need to be able to turn a portion of their assets into cash with a speed sufficient to meet outflows when uninsured depositors or other short-term creditors demand it. Regulation needs to reflect realistic assumptions about monetization.</p>
<p>We should also consider updating some assumptions about deposit outflows in our liquidity requirements so that they better align with observed stress behavior. During the stress in 2023, we saw uninsured deposits from high-net worth individuals and certain entities, such as venture capital firms, behave more like highly sophisticated financial counterparties than nonfinancial companies or ordinary retail depositors, which is how they are generally treated in regulations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;This mis-measured risk of deposit outflows means banks may not have sufficient liquidity to manage a stress period.</p>
<p>In a related vein, banks have stepped up their use of reciprocal deposit arrangements&mdash;arrangements where deposits are spread across many banks within a network&mdash;as a way to manage the risk of deposit amounts over $250,000.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;While this arrangement spreads risk across the banking system, it is a strategy that has not been tested in a large-scale stress event. It is only logical to wonder how the attenuation of relationships between customers and banks under reciprocal arrangements will affect the behavior of depositors worried about a bank run. We also need to be attentive to operational risks in these arrangements, as well as the risk-management capacity of these companies to manage these relationships under stress.</p>
<p>A final lesson from the bank stress two years ago is that we need to do more to ensure that all banks that come under stress can be resolved in an orderly fashion. One way to do this would be to require all large banks&mdash;including those that are not G-SIBS&mdash;to issue certain amounts of long-term debt. This would have helped reassure depositors worried about the stability of bank funding and aided in the eventual resolution of at least some of the banks that came under stress in 2023. The banking agencies have proposed a rule on long-term debt requirements, we have received many helpful comments that led us to adjust it in draft form, and I support moving forward to finalize it with those adjustments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>As I mentioned, revised Basel III standards, revised long-term debt requirements, and to-be-proposed liquidity standards would help to address gaps in our current framework, and I continue to believe that they should move forward.</p>
<p>Moreover, banks and supervisors should also stay vigilant to known risks in the current environment. For instance, risks remain in the commercial real estate market, particularly within the office segment, as borrowers may find it difficult to refinance maturing loans. And interest rate risk, especially for those with high levels of uninsured deposits, remains a key area of focus.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain the Credibility of the Stress Test</strong><br />We face a challenging environment with the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. The stress tests helped the financial sector emerge from the Global Financial Crisis and rebuild its credibility. The annual stress tests are still important to the financial sector's credibility today. The stress tests help banks, market participants, and supervisors understand the banks' vulnerabilities to shocks and to guard against those shocks by holding sufficient capital.</p>
<p>In December, the Board announced that, due to the evolving legal landscape, we would be undertaking significant changes to the stress tests to reduce capital volatility and improve transparency.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;While I recognize that we need to increase transparency to reflect changes in the legal environment in which we operate, there are good reasons why I and many of my colleagues and predecessors have been averse to such full disclosures since the inception of the stress test fifteen years ago. There are several risks that we will need to guard against.</p>
<p>First, we need to guard against the risk that the process results in reduced capital requirements. As they did during the Basel III process, banks are likely to argue against various aspects of the Fed's models that result in higher capital requirements, and not to highlight the areas in which the models underestimate risks. We should take those comments on the Fed's models seriously and adjust the models as appropriate, but we should be careful not to overcorrect and lower bank capital requirements in ways that underestimate aggregate risk. The Administrative Procedure Act should be a vehicle for transparency and public input into agency action, not used to weaken regulatory requirements that preserve the safety and stability of our financial system.</p>
<p>Second, we need to guard against the risk that banks lower their capital requirements because of increased transparency. Increased disclosure of details about the Fed's stress models could enable banks to optimize stress test results by adjusting their balance sheet based on their knowledge of where the models underprice risk, in order to reduce their capital requirements without materially reducing risks. Gaming the test in this way would be a bad outcome for risk management and our economy.</p>
<p>Third, banks are likely to change their behavior in other ways that increase risk. We should be aware of the risk that full transparency into the models and scenarios used by regulators could discourage banks from investing in their own risk management if the test becomes too predictable. Full transparency may also encourage concentration across the system in assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test. And banks are likely to reduce their management buffers over required levels, which will bring greater risks of breaching the minimums and regulatory buffers when a significant risk event eventually happens.</p>
<p>The fourth risk, and perhaps the greatest one, is that over time, given the difficulty of navigating the notice and comment rulemaking process on an ongoing basis to update the models we use, the dynamism and accuracy of the stress test will fade.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;And as the events of two years ago show, it is hard to predict where risks will emerge in the financial system; an inherent challenge of preserving the relevancy of stress testing is coming up with a set of adverse scenarios that are novel enough, and dynamic enough, to reflect the risks that banks may face from unanticipated developments. I believe that the Fed should commit to investing in a credible, effective process to maintain the dynamism of the binding stress test by regularly updating its models and scenario variables to reflect changes in the environment and changes to bank behavior. This will require resources and a strong commitment up front and over time, but it will be necessary to maintain a credible stress test.</p>
<p>One effort we've already undertaken should help: to maintain the dynamism of the stress test, we launched exploratory stress scenarios to consider a wider range of possible conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;The Fed used this approach during the pandemic, and we've now made it a regular part of our annual stress test exercise.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;The exploratory scenarios are not used to set binding capital requirements and are only reported on an aggregate level, but they help the Fed better understand risks posed to individual banks and to the banking system as a whole that are not captured in binding scenarios. I hope and trust that the Fed will continue this important analytical work.</p>
<p>As an additional backstop to help ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand losses, the Fed should preserve its discretion to set individually binding capital requirements on firms based on supervisory judgment under the International Lending Supervision Act. Jurisdictions around the world undertake a similar process under a so-called Basel "Pillar 2" approach, and the United States would benefit from using such a framework as well. That is all the more important given the changes the Fed is undertaking for the binding stress tests.</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining Credible, Consistent Supervision</strong><br />Another area warranting continued vigilance is supervision. There will undoubtedly be calls to revamp supervision to reduce burden. And I am all for making sure supervision is the most effective and efficient it can be. Supervisors need to focus on the most urgent and important risks, and not burden firms with unnecessary or distracting matters. But we need to be careful to preserve and enhance the ability of supervisors to act with speed, force, and agility as appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>Supervisors have emphasized proactive supervisory engagement, which helps banks address issues before they grow so large as to threaten the bank or broader financial stability. Earlier intervention means that firms are likely to have more options to fix their problems, with little impact on bank profitability.<a name="f5"></a><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>We should continue work to improve the effectiveness of our supervision and use data-driven analysis to improve our scoping and prioritization of supervisory issues. I support this work to the extent that it makes our supervision more effective and focused on the right issues. But the Board should resist initiatives that impede effective supervision by discouraging examiners to flag issues early, or initiatives that increase unnecessary process around issuing findings in a manner that impedes the speed and agility of supervision when it is needed. More generally, supervision is another area in which "efficiency and competitiveness" should not be used as an excuse for lax oversight that significantly impairs the safety and soundness of individual institutions and undermines broader financial stability.</p>
<p>We should take caution from our experience with SVB. While some have claimed that the examiners at SVB did not focus on the right issues, it's important to highlight that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the Fed allocated an insufficient number of examiner resources to SVB while in the RBO portfolio, and that the examiners assigned to SVB as it was growing did not have sufficient expertise in supervising large, complex institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Once it was in the large bank portfolio, examiners highlighted the risk from interest rate risk and uninsured depositors, but did not act with sufficient force to get the bank to change course in a timely way. We've made important changes since then, but we need to be sure we get the staff resources in place, and provide support to examiners on the front line, so that they can act with the speed, force, and agility warranted by the facts.</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging Responsible Innovation</strong><br />Another set of risks involve those related to the role of innovative technology in the financial sector. Innovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers, financial institutions, and the economy at large. For instance, blockchain technology underlying crypto-assets has the potential to make financial services better, cheaper, and faster. Responsible use of this technology could make banking more efficient and accessible to more consumers.</p>
<p>With any new technology, there are new risks. To achieve the benefits in a durable manner over time, we must ensure that the associated risks are managed appropriately. With crypto-assets, investors do not currently have the structural protections they have relied on for many decades in other financial markets. It is important that those guardrails are put in place to avoid issues such as the misuse of client funds, misrepresentations, obfuscation about availability of deposit insurance, and fraud. We should also recognize that some of the attractive attributes of crypto-assets&mdash;the pseudonymous actors that are parties to transactions, the ease and speed of transfer, and the general irrevocability of transactions&mdash;also make crypto-assets attractive for use in money laundering and terrorist financing. It is encouraging to see innovators develop tools and processes to better manage these risks, while harnessing the benefits of the technology. But regulation and supervision also have an essential role to play.</p>
<p>Responsible innovation is in everyone's interest. In the past few years, we stood up the Novel Activities Supervision Program, which dedicates resources to understanding how technology is transforming banking and supports banks' ability to innovate while ensuring that banks clearly understand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;I hope and trust that approach will continue.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing Cyber and Third-Party Risk</strong><br />Cyber risk from both foreign powers and non-state actors has become a major concern for banks, and regulators will need to ensure that these risks are being properly managed. The operational disruption propagated through a third-party security company last summer was a wake-up call for banks and regulators about vulnerabilities in a system where security is outsourced. Disruption of one of these critical systems may compromise a bank's ability to execute important functions and adversely affect individual firm safety and soundness as well as the broader financial system. Given the significant concentration in the IT industry, we should expect operational failures at single IT entities to have potentially far-reaching effects, no matter their original cause. And advances in artificial intelligence are likely to give bad actors new tools for fraud and infiltration, while also providing banks with new tools to combat these attacks. Both banks and the Federal Reserve need to continue to invest in cyber resiliency.</p>
<p><strong>Risks in the Nonbank Sector</strong><br />Let me speak next to the perennial concerns of intermediation by financial firms outside the bank regulatory perimeter. An increasingly varied and evolving collection of nonbank clients, including hedge funds, private credit, and insurance companies, is playing a significant role in the global economy and presenting new risks.</p>
<p>Beginning with hedge funds, bank exposures to hedge funds have risen over the past several years, and concurrently, hedge fund leverage remains near historic highs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Archegos's failure revealed the risks presented by hedge funds and the degree of interconnectedness between banks and hedge funds. And the exploratory analysis as part of last year's stress test showed that banks have material exposures to hedge funds under certain market conditions, and that the hedge fund counterparty exposures can vary significant based on the specific set of shocks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>One area that has grown substantially is the Treasury cash-futures basis trade.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;The basis trade helps provide liquidity and price discovery in normal times, as hedge funds trade with asset managers and other financial institutions to align returns to holding Treasury securities and related futures. But the trade involves high levels of leverage, which can contribute to a rapid unwinding in positions and exacerbate market stress, as we saw in the spring of 2020. In principle, margining practices and participants' risk-management activities should limit these risks, but individual firms do not account for the spillovers their actions can have on market functioning. These externalities suggest a role for regulation, and the central clearing mandate for Treasury market trading is an important step in supporting the resilience of this market. At the same time, we need to continue to consider how we can support the collection of minimum margin across trading venues and in bilateral trades to avoid loopholes and risks, and continue to monitor banks' credit risk management practices with these hedge fund counterparties.</p>
<p>Another area that has experienced rapid growth in recent years is private credit, which is now comparable in size to the high-yield bond market and leveraged loan market.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;Traditional private credit arrangements rely on limited leverage and generally have long-term funding, making them less vulnerable to the deleveraging spiral associated with high leverage and short-term funding. Nonetheless, risks may be growing. The connections between private credit and banks have been expanding, and private credit remains opaque, with limited information relative to asset classes of similar size.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;Moreover, the rapid growth and opacity of the sector raise the risk that recent private credit arrangements may be assuming new risks. Retail investors can now gain exposure to the asset class through mutual or exchange traded funds, which could present the age-old consumer and financial stability risks we see when opaque, illiquid assets are converted to liquid ones.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a></p>
<p>We also need to monitor risks in the insurance industry. Households planning for retirement often rely on life insurance companies to provide them a steady stream of income. In principle, life insurance companies are the ultimate patient investor and thus the natural vehicle to finance long-maturity and risky projects. Indeed, while venture capital funding gets a lot of the attention, mobilized retirement savings through life insurance companies have supported long-term investments in capital-intensive projects. However, life insurance companies, just like other financial institutions, can overpromise and be tempted to take on greater risk than their liability holders or regulators appreciate. Given the complexity of some investment vehicles, the institutions themselves may not fully appreciate all of the risks. The life insurance sector has been changing. Even as the life insurance industry has been increasing its holdings of assets originated by private equity firms, private equity firms have been acquiring life insurers directly. Moreover, private-equity-affiliated insurers rely more heavily on nontraditional liabilities, which may prove flighty in a stress event. This is something to watch carefully. In the next business cycle downturn, it's possible that unexpected losses at insurance companies could lead to a sharp pullback and deeper credit crunch.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Risk</strong><br />Finally, regulators will need to continue to confront the financial risks from climate change. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to recognize emerging risks to the safety and soundness of banks, to the ability of households and businesses to access financial services, and to financial stability. Costly natural disasters could present just such risks.</p>
<p>The recent wildfires in California should be a wake-up call that we need to focus on how insurance markets will need to adjust to more frequent and severe weather events. The loss of life and hardship borne by many households is tragic, and the economic losses associated with the wildfires, while uncertain, are likely to be among the largest losses from a natural disaster on record. The wildfires should remind us of the problems in property and casualty insurance markets&mdash;just as the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Helene reminded us of significant gaps in flood insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Often the structure and regulation of insurance markets prevents risk from being appropriately priced, limiting the ability of market signals to influence development and adaptation in high-risk areas and contributing to the buildup of risks. And there is a broader question of the extent to which private capital will be sufficient to cover increasing natural disaster risk.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has an important but narrow role to play with respect to climate change, and that is to focus on risks from climate change to bank safety and soundness and financial stability. The pilot climate scenario analysis conducted by the Federal Reserve was an important step forward in assessing the capacity of the largest banks, as well as in building our own capacity, to perform the kind of analysis that is increasingly crucial as risks arising from more severe weather events become a driver of financial risk for specific firms and the broader economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250220a.htm#fn26" title="footnote 26"><span>26</span></a><a name="f26"></a>&nbsp;Guidance for the largest banks also plays an important role in reminding banks of basic principles in prudent risk management as it applies to these types of climate-related risks.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In conclusion, the United States has the benefit of a strong, vigorous economy, the deepest and most liquid markets in the world, and a critical place in the world economy through the role of the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve has an essential role in maintaining the strength and resilience of the U.S. economy, including through its vigilance about the risks I discussed today. A strong and resilient banking system benefits the American people. We need to be humble about our ability to predict shocks to the financial system, and how they will propagate through vulnerabilities in the system. That is why it is so important to have strong regulation and supervision as shock absorbers to protect households and businesses from risks emanating from the financial system.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to speak directly to the staff of the Federal Reserve and express my deep gratitude. Your rigorous analysis and deep expertise are fundamental to our ability to promote a strong and stable financial system that serves the American people. Thank you for your outstanding service.</p>

<p>Chancellor launches coalition to improve sustainable sovereign debt financing to developing economies, shoring up London&rsquo;s position as development finance leader amid growing global uncertainty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reeves aims to boost private capital mobilisation for development ahead of her attendance of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&rsquo;s annual meeting on 13-15 May in London</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In Canary Wharf today (20 February) the Chancellor met with some of the UK&rsquo;s biggest financial services firms such as Aviva, HSBC and Schroders and urged them to work with development institutions including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>) and British International Investment. To go further and faster in delivering the government&rsquo;s Plan for Change and put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets, the Chancellor encouraged firms to seize investment opportunities in emerging markets for Britain&rsquo;s brightest and best companies.</p>
<p>Co-hosting a roundtable with Odile Renaud-Basso, president of the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>, the Chancellor launched the &ldquo;London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt&rdquo;. This will be co-chaired by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Emma Reynolds.</p>
<p>The Coalition will bring together government and private sector stakeholders to find innovative solutions to more sustainable sovereign debt financing in developing economies.</p>
<p>Promoting orderly and transparent debt restructuring and more resilient borrowing will mean that emerging economies can make progress meeting their climate and development targets. The Coalition capitalises on London&rsquo;s financial services expertise and will help cement its position as a global leader in development finance, in turn supporting economic activity and financing investment across the country. Investing in emerging markets themselves can boost UK growth by creating new opportunities for British businesses in areas such as financial services, and boost trade ties with fast-growing economies amid an increasingly uncertain global environment.</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business and government must work together to seize opportunities in emerging markets and kickstart economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
<p class="last-child">Today&rsquo;s roundtable shows how the UK&rsquo;s world-leading financial centre can help countries unlock new opportunities for our brightest and best British companies to create wealth and drive growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Odile Renaud-Basso said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Mobilising private capital is key to meeting global development needs. I&rsquo;m delighted to co-host UK business leaders with the Chancellor to discuss how multilateral banks like the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>&nbsp;can help channel further financing to emerging markets. By joining forces, we aim to deliver the much-needed impact for developing countries while creating new opportunities for businesses from developed economies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chancellor and Renaud-Basso also signed a Memorandum of Understanding setting out cooperation on the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>&nbsp;annual meeting and business forum in London, which will be held from 13 to 15 May this year.</p>
<p>The Chancellor will attend the bank&rsquo;s first annual meeting in London since 2016 where it will see governors approve the bank&rsquo;s next 5-year strategy and highlight opportunities for UK businesses to work with the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>&nbsp;in its key markets such as Ukraine, Poland and Turkey.</p>
<p>Reeves and Renaud-Basso discussed with business leaders how to create the right environment for investment. This is being done at home, for example through reforms to the pensions system which could unlock around &pound;80 billion in productive investment and the launch of the Transition Finance Council led by Lord Alok Sharma. It is also key to work overseas, where British International Investment and UK-backed programmes including MOBILIST and the Private Infrastructure Development Group have unlocked billions in private investment for climate and development around the world. A new Institutional Investor Taskforce will advise government and institutional investors on how they can work together to open up even more of this much-needed investment and establish London as the world&rsquo;s leading climate and development finance hub.</p>
<p>Reeves outlined the UK&rsquo;s growth priorities, both at home and abroad, and highlighted the financing tools and instruments to help achieve this such as the National Wealth Fund, which is expected to mobilise over &pound;70 billion in private investment into the high-growth industries of the future. Reeves also underscored the importance of multilateral development banks in helping to mobilise private capital, through working together more effectively as a system and with the private sector.</p>
<p>As the largest institutional investor in Ukraine, the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>&nbsp;has also been working with the UK government to support Ukraine&rsquo;s resilience and recovery. In December, the UK confirmed its participation in a EUR 4bn capital increase which will unlock billions each year to support critical sectors of Ukraine&rsquo;s economy. The&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>&nbsp;and Aon also launched an innovative $110m war insurance facility with UK support in the same month to rebuild the country&rsquo;s insurance market.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the&nbsp;<abbr title="European Bank for Reconstruction and Development">EBRD</abbr>&nbsp;invests in 36 economies across three continents including in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, Central Asia and North Africa. This year it will also begin operations in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The roundtable comes ahead of the Chancellor&rsquo;s visit to Cape Town, South Africa, next week to attend the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting. She will be advocating for the UK&rsquo;s Growth Mission on the global stage and championing how private capital and the role of the City will kickstart economic growth and raise living standards around the world.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Baroness Shriti Vadera, Chair of Prudential PLC and Co-Chair of the World Bank Private Sector Investment Lab, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">It is critical for governments, international financial institutions, and the private sector to work together to mobilise, at scale and pace, greater levels of finance for climate and development where it is most needed - in emerging and developing markets. I particularly&nbsp;welcome the focus today on practical steps to develop and deploy risk-sharing and blended financial instruments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dame Elizabeth Corley, Chair of Schroders PLC, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">I firmly believe asset managers play a key role in crowding in private capital and unlocking it at scale in emerging markets. Schroders, with its impact pioneer BlueOrchard, is eager to share our expertise in blended finance and impact investing to overcome barriers to private sector investment, redressing some of the world&rsquo;s biggest challenges like climate change and inequality.</p>

<title>Innovation In UK Financial Markets - Shortening The Settlement Cycle – Speech By Sasha Mills, Bank Of England, Executive Director, Financial Market Infrastructure - Given At The UK T+1 Accelerated Settlement Market Event, Hosted By KPMG</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The industry Task Force has set out a roadmap to shorten the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1. In her speech, Sasha Mills explains why it is important that firms and settlement infrastructures put in place plans for sustainable change that can bring long term efficiencies, while maintaining resilient settlement processes. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing to have dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p><a id="_Hlk190163440"></a>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank Andrew Douglas and the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce for inviting me to speak today,</p>
<p>And also to thank KPMG for hosting today&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>Last year I spoke about the Bank of England&rsquo;s (the Bank) aim to facilitate safe innovation in the often overlooked post-trade segment of financial markets.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-speech-at-uk-accelerated-settlement-market-event-kpmg#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;For those of you who read that speech, you might characterise my comments today as faster horses leading to faster settlement.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m pleased to have an opportunity to continue the theme of post-trade innovation - with a focus on bringing innovation to the post-trade settlement process for shares and bonds, making it more efficient, resilient and shorter.</p>
<p>We along with most other countries around the world - think that shorter settlement cycles - and the automation of manual processes this will incentivise - can bring a lot of benefits, for the UK as well as the market participants, domestic and international who make use of our markets.</p>
<p>As I'll come on to explain in more detail in a moment, a shorter settlement cycle supports financial stability by reducing the risks faced by market participants and central counterparties, it will provide investors with quicker access to their funds, and it will free up resources for other productive uses, supporting growth.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-speech-at-uk-accelerated-settlement-market-event-kpmg#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>And a "by-product" of moving to T+1 is that post-trade processes will be made more resilient, faster, and more efficient.</p>
<p>But in order to achieve the reduction in risks and the freeing up of resources, firms need to help make a smooth transition to T+1 happen by preparing and testing changes to their systems and procedures, well ahead of the transition. By doing this we'll help to avoid an increase in settlement fails and disruption that would undermine the benefits and confidence in UK markets.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that today&rsquo;s high levels of operational resilience and low levels of settlement failure are maintained.</p>
<p>As I'll come on to say in a moment, for the Bank, ensuring this is largely a question of time and money:</p>
<p>firms need to make use of the time available to prepare, adapt, and test systems - and they also need to provide sufficient budget to pay for these preparations.</p>
<h3>Bank's Stance on T+1</h3>
<p>Before getting into some of the specificities, I wanted to set the stage by confirming that the Bank, along with colleagues at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HMT, supports the UK's move to T+1 and notes the many benefits this move should deliver to the UK and the UK financial markets which are used by UK companies and households as well as market participants around the world:</p>

<li>A shorter settlement cycle will mean that firms and central counterparties (or "CCPs") face lower counterparty risks - and I anticipate this will lead to significant amounts of margin being released by CCPs to members and their clients,</li>
<li>We estimate that the amount of margin released may be on the order of &pound;1 billion<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-speech-at-uk-accelerated-settlement-market-event-kpmg#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;- a significant sum which could be used by market participants for other productive purposes, supporting the UK economy,</li>
<li>It should reduce the costs and risks associated with the existing misalignment of settlement cycles. The UK's settlement cycle is currently misaligned with the cycles in jurisdictions (such as the US) which have already transitioned to T+1 settlement,</li>
<li>The transition to T+1 should catalyse firms' investment in automation and standardisation, leading to lower settlement costs in the medium term and more efficient markets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite these many benefits from transitioning to T+1, there are a number of challenges which will need to be addressed:</p>
<p>I'll focus on two of these challenges: adapting to multiple time zones and standardising and automating settlement instructions.</p>
<p>UK financial markets serve a host of domestic investors, issuers and intermediaries.</p>
<p>But they also serve market participants around the globe: international participants which are located in a multiplicity of time zones.</p>
<p>In light of the international character of UK markets, the industry group tasked with leading on the T+1 transition, the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce (or "AST") - a group incorporating institutions from the sell-side, buy-side and infrastructure providers is alive to this challenge.</p>
<p>The AST has laudably sought to consider the needs of both UK-based participants - as well as the needs of the many market participants based in other countries and other time zones!</p>
<p>And a shortening of the UK securities settlement cycle will mean that UK financial market participants will need to make corresponding adjustments to their processes and systems.</p>
<p>This cycle shortening (unless carefully planned and executed) runs the risk of creating challenges for market participants such as investors and intermediaries which are many time zones away.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity here is the fact that participants in other time-zones will often have an "FX leg" and FX settlement to organise in addition to organising the settlement of the underlying securities purchase or sale.</p>
<p>Unless carefully managed, there's a risk that participants in other time zones will struggle to meet the opening hour windows for settlement instructions and related communications with settlement platforms (whether for FX or securities settlement).</p>
<p>In light of this risk, we are pleased that the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce has set out an approach which should make it technically feasible for participants in other jurisdictions to accomplish the steps needed in time to permit settlement to occur within the T+1 timeframe.</p>
<p>Another important area of challenge relates to the slightly "niche" topic of settlement instructions:</p>
<p>Settlement instructions are an important part of the settlement process.</p>
<p>Buyers and sellers submit these instructions to the CSD (or centralised securities depository) a key step in the settlement process enabling settlement to occur.</p>
<p>But for many years, the industry has recognised issues with these instructions, in that settlement processes can get "snarled up" and even fail due to instruction formats not being standardised and instruction submissions not being automated, often involving manual processes.</p>
<p>Given this, we applaud the efforts of the industry - and in particular, the efforts of the Financial Markets Standards Board (or FMSB):</p>
<p>The FMSB's recent publication of standards and templates for settlement instructions<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-speech-at-uk-accelerated-settlement-market-event-kpmg#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;is a very welcome step towards resolving this issue. This publication marks an important milestone in making the settlement process more efficient and operationally resilient.</p>
<p>Market participants should read the FMSB report and adopt their recommendations.</p>
<h3>What T+1 means for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs)</h3>
<p>Having touched on the benefits and some of the challenges of a move to T+1, I'd like to turn now to the topic of today's event: namely the implementation plan published by the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce:</p>
<p>A plan which effectively charts out how the UK industry can safely transition to T+1 settlement.</p>
<p>The AST has set out in their plan what needs to be done by when for a smooth transition to T+1.</p>
<p>For example, among the "critical actions", the report calls for Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) to review all existing procedures, policies, and technology to ensure that there are no barriers to T+1 settlement.</p>
<p>And among the report's "highly recommended" actions is a direction for FMIs to ensure that their rulebooks are amended to accurately set out the updated T+1-compatible FMI systems and processes.</p>
<p>Another highly recommended action is for the industry group and the UK CSD to define and publish a target rate for settlement efficiency.</p>
<p>As the supervisor of FMIs, the Bank has an important role in making the UK's transition to T+1 a reality.</p>
<p>As you will know, FMIs play a vital role in&nbsp;the UK's financial system. They provide the critical "plumbing" which allow for financial markets to function. And they ensure that the flow of payments and securities related to trading, issuance and other market activities occurs reliably and efficiently, managing risks and providing confidence that financial transactions will be completed safely. This confidence is an engine for growth as businesses take investment decisions and plan their futures accordingly.</p>
<p>The UK's move to T+1 is aligned with the Bank's primary and secondary objectives of protecting and enhancing the stability of the financial system of the UK, and facilitating innovation in the provision of CCP and CSD services with a view to improving the quality, efficiency and economy of the services.</p>
<h3>The Bank as FMI Supervisor</h3>
<p>As FMI supervisor, the Bank&nbsp;expects relevant FMIs to prepare for and implement necessary changes for a move to T+1, maintaining operational resilience throughout, changing their rules and systems, and facilitating preparations by their members.</p>
<p>All of these things are commensurate with the central roles FMIs play in the UK financial system.</p>
<p>As the report indicates, a successful transition will be made more likely if firms (sell-side firms, buy-side firms, FMIs and others) automate their settlement processes and systems (some of which (as I mentioned earlier) are still surprisingly manual in nature!).</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead, I encourage firms, their senior executives, and boards to prioritise this work and seek the necessary budget for system adaptations.</p>
<p>And after these adaptations are implemented, firms must test and mitigate any issues arising from these adaptations and any new process flows well ahead of the transition date.</p>
<p>I'd like now to say a word or two on the topic of "Alignment".</p>
<p>As HMT, AST and others have said, it would be desirable for the UK and other jurisdictions (including, for example, the EU and Switzerland) to coordinate and align timetables on the transition to T+1.</p>
<p>There are obvious benefits to alignment and we are pleased that the UK, EU and Swiss are working towards transitioning on the same date - 11 October 2027.</p>
<p>We are pleased that both the UK Government and the European Commission have proposed that transition happen on 11 October 2027. This is evidence of a desire to align.</p>
<h3>The road ahead</h3>
<p>In the coming couple of years, market participants and FMIs will be executing their<br />firm-specific T+1 project plans - in line with the recommendations set out in the report.</p>
<p>And the Bank looks forward to continuing to actively engage with this workstream by acting as an observer on the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce and by engaging with the relevant FMIs we supervise - and having discussions about FMIs' preparations for transition.</p>
<p>As a concluding comment I'd like to be clear that FMIs and market participants need to do four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>to carefully read the implementation plan;</li>
<li>to produce their own firm-specific project plans;</li>
<li>to obtain the necessary funding to execute their project plans; and lastly,</li>
<li>they should implement and test the changes to their systems and procedures in accordance with the timelines set out in the report.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bank is committed to supporting the UK's transition to T+1, which is an important innovation that supports financial stability and growth and ensures UK financial markets remain among the most resilient and efficient in the world.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank Charles Gundy, Barry King, Shane Scott, and Michael Yoganayagam for their assistance in preparing these remarks.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the creation of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) to focus on combatting cyber-related misconduct and to protect retail investors from bad actors in the emerging technologies space. The CETU, led by Laura D&rsquo;Allaird, replaces the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and is comprised of approximately 30 fraud specialists and attorneys across multiple SEC offices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under Laura&rsquo;s leadership, this new unit will complement the work of the Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Importantly, the new unit will also allow the SEC to deploy enforcement resources judiciously,&rdquo; said Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda. &ldquo;The unit will not only protect investors but will also facilitate capital formation and market efficiency by clearing the way for innovation to grow. It will root out those seeking to misuse innovation to harm investors and diminish confidence in new technologies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specifically, the CETU will utilize the staff&rsquo;s substantial fintech and cyber-related experience to combat misconduct as it relates to securities transactions in the following priority areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fraud committed using emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning</li>
<li>Use of social media, the dark web, or false websites to perpetrate fraud</li>
<li>Hacking to obtain material nonpublic information</li>
<li>Takeovers of retail brokerage accounts</li>
<li>Fraud involving blockchain technology and crypto assets</li>
<li>Regulated entities&rsquo; compliance with cybersecurity rules and regulations</li>
<li>Public issuer fraudulent disclosure relating to cybersecurity</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, is publishing today technical standards on different aspects of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) Refit.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The rules relate to the information to be provided by European CSDs to their national competent authorities (NCAs) for the review and evaluation process, to the criteria for assessing the importance of European CSDs in a host Member State and to the information to be notified by third-country CSDs.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The technical standards are set out in three separate final reports:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA74-2119945925-2089_CSDR_Refit_Final_Report_on_TS_on_Review_and_Evaluation.pdf">The&nbsp;<span>review and evaluation process</span>&nbsp;of EU CSDs</a>, where ESMA suggest a harmonisation of the information to be shared by CSDs for feeding the overall assessment of the competent authorities, plus a one-year implementing period for the new reporting items that will require an adaptation of the IT processes of CSDs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA74-2119945925-1951_CSDR_Final_Report_on_Draft_RTS_on_CSD_substantial_importance.pdf">The&nbsp;<span>criteria</span></a>&nbsp;under which the activities of an EU CSD in a host Member State could be considered of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of investors. It includes details about the data collection process for the indicators needed to assess the substantial importance of European CSDs in a host Member State. This will be the basis to determine the CSDs for which colleges of supervisors have to be established.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA74-2119945925-2141_CSDR_Refit_Final_Report_on_third-country_CSDs.pdf">The&nbsp;<span>notifications from third country CSDs</span></a>, where ESMA is proposing to streamline the information to be notified, aiming for an accurate understanding of the provision of notary, central maintenance and settlement services in the Union.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">The CSDR Refit aims to fine-tune and clarify the CSDR framework. All the Final Reports published today considered the input from the relevant stakeholders and the cross-cutting effort of regulatory burden reduction when possible.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">The three final reports with the draft technical standards have been submitted to the European Commission (EC) for adoption.</p>

CFCA is an authoritative electronic certification body established by the People's Bank of China and approved by the National Information Security Administration.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>The vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity pioneered by GLEIF and&nbsp;</span></span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC0XauvKen-2BAw2v2fpxe0d5PHccQa2D6iexbZ1IJqlhs-2B-2Ffm8YnXJ92pzZYWjlFrbT57mNBgEcfcpV4nW-2F-2FXZ35pkkHG8XqNdDR8F2uODBTgL31hQFl6fK6JMTU8GphgRWOdSVZKW-2BxOkmxY2v0C694-2FULYkk1PkJwdyqIlbh2MqS3ArQhSABLU-2ByYrzLpd7p00xkwxrM9MtYx1fUpMghep4XvA2pZA8-2BcIxM9DVeXgZa9zH9_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgopkqlx8cS0FFNxZUe51piZ6n6okyeDMJdkH51q5lbJ1CbKrK-2FN9A2-2FZ3E0Qhk1jsCvnSIougtAdmFq1VzyVxoy9eiYZf-2BghL-2BHp-2FuioF7xi4HH1If8trGyy22VU7Ynyn5ajhyxuufKwu4xDlVpyg4wfboJ6Cw58lHl7A98w0heVSD77who8ul9vzlhQKIZncG1xq44hNs1EX8fNeN1ffzXtFFcy2pB-2Bp2B30odiEOULYxVoCUPN-2BakBsjvPtBwz9-2FX9VfD6-2FuEGstg8T-2BfezzuSNdydm0iLBagxYaNquj6TdYL3bmoRh2h0gFEis2Dnes-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"><span>. It addresses the urgent global need for digitized, automated authentication and verification of organizations and the individuals acting on their behalf. It supports sensitive business transactions and official interactions across use cases where digital trust is paramount.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>As a QVI, CFCA will utilize the vLEI to complement and interoperate with existing Chinese identity verification tools for enterprises and individuals. vLEI role credentials will enable individuals affiliated with legal entities to be credibly disclosed and recognized, helping businesses mitigate identity fraud risks and improve the efficiency and quality of risk control and compliance identification in areas such as trade and payment transactions. For individuals, including their vLEI credentials in personal identity records will help to mitigate fraud risks and enhance their identity credibility when conducting actions on behalf of an entity in a certain role.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, comments: &ldquo;The digitalization of businesses has given rise to many new identity-based risks, and confidence in digital authenticity is still in short supply. As businesses increasingly cooperate and transact remotely and across borders, the LEI and vLEI systems have been designed to ease global trade by ensuring verifiable organizational identity and building trust into every business relationship. Becoming China's first qualified vLEI issuer is a recognition of CFCA's technical prowess and influence in the fight against global financial crime and evidence of its continued leadership in financial technology innovation and security in the digital age."</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Gang Zhu, General Manager of CFCA, comments: "Since its establishment in 1998, CFCA has been dedicated to driving the secure digital transformation of the financial industry and has been an engaged, innovative member of the Global LEI System. As a Qualified vLEI Issuer, we will actively explore how this new form of digital identity can augment China's existing tools to advance the transparency and verifiability of Chinese business and trade data. There are a great many observable applications for the vLEI and the potential benefits, both domestically and on the global stage, are manifold. We look forward to collaborating closely with GLEIF to advance this important field."</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Now qualified, CFCA will explore various vLEI-enabled digital identity scenarios. These include real-time account registration verification, tamper-resistant digital signing, verifiable SME credit records, ESG-based credentialing, simplified cross-border payments, secure judicial data verification, and AI-driven customs oversight.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Already an early participant in the GLEIF Certification Authorities Stakeholder Group, CFCA was confirmed in 2021 as the first Certification Authority globally to become a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System and was the first to demonstrate a commercial model for embedding LEIs in digital certificates.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>iFAST Global Bank ("iGB" or the "Bank"), the digital banking division of iFAST Corporation Ltd. ("iFAST Corp"), has reached a major milestone, achieving profitability in the October to December 2024 quarter (4Q2024) and exceeding S$1 billion in customer deposits as at end-December 2024.</p>
<p>A fully licensed UK bank, iGB offers multi-currency deposits, payment services, and remittance solutions. The Bank is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and is a direct member of the Bank of England's Faster Payment Scheme, Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), and SWIFT.</p>
<p>In less than three years since its acquisition by Singapore-headquartered iFAST Corp, iGB has successfully turned profitable. Meanwhile, customer deposits surged 182.6% year-on-year (YoY), reaching S$1.01 billion by year-end &ndash; a testament to growing global confidence from customers in the Bank.</p>
<p>"Achieving profitability in under three years is a major milestone for iFAST Global Bank," said&nbsp;<b>Lim Chung Chun, CEO of iFAST Corp</b>. "Crossing S$1 billion in deposits further reinforces our successful execution of a truly global business model. These achievements highlight our ability to deploy new technology solutions rapidly, in a secure manner, and at far lower costs than most banks around the world."</p>
<p>The Bank's strong revenue growth was driven by its Digital Personal Banking (DPB) division, which was launched in April 2023. In 4Q2024, gross revenue surged 163.7% YoY to S$17.22 million, while net revenue climbed 136.4% YoY to S$7.72 million.</p>
<p>"The expanding DPB customer base significantly boosted deposit growth, particularly in fixed-term accounts," said&nbsp;<b>Simon Lee, General Manager of the DPB division in iGB</b>. "We are further strengthening our product offerings, including the upcoming launch of a debit card to enhance our local presence."</p>
<p>With continued expansion of its digital banking ecosystem, iGB is expected to build upon its profitable quarter and achieve full-year profitability in 2025.</p>
<p><b>Key Developments in 2024:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Record Deposit Growth:</b>&nbsp;Customer deposits crossed S$1.01 billion (GBP 593.50 million), led by 39.8% QoQ growth in DPB, particularly in fixed-term deposits.</li>
<li><b>Profitability Achieved:</b>&nbsp;Net profit of S$0.30 million in 4Q2024, a turnaround from a S$2.57 million loss in 4Q2023.</li>
<li><b>DPB Expansion:</b>&nbsp;Increasing customer base and product offerings, including an upcoming debit card launch.</li>
<li><b>EzRemit Growth:</b>&nbsp;Record-high transaction volumes and expansion in the GCC region.</li>

<p>ICJ, Inc, (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.icj.co.jp/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Investor Communications Japan</a>) announced today that they will further utilize the services of global Fintech leader,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE:BR), to handle part of their electronic proxy voting service platform&rsquo;s data processing following the full-scale launch of the Japan Securities Depository Center (JASDEC) 2025 project. ICJ is a joint venture by Broadridge and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/corporate/about-jpx/profile/01.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.&nbsp;</a>Broadridge&rsquo;s solution will enable ICJ to continue this service after the current solution and infrastructure are decommissioned in accordance with the security enhancement of the JASDEC2025 New Shareholder Information System initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;To date, we have worked closely with Broadridge operating our joint electronic proxy voting platform for over 1,800 Japanese issuers, launching the ESG Access service in August 2024, and now we have decided to further expand this collaboration to promote the digitalization of data processing and the enhancement of security,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;<b>said ICJ President, Shigeo Imakiire.</b>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Given Broadridge&rsquo;s proven global track record of leveraging transformative technology to expand corporate governance, we are excited to enhance our client services with the digitalization of the annual general meeting of shareholders (AGM) process.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Broadridge is proud to support the ongoing growth of ICJ, by providing innovative digital technology solutions to benefit issuers and investors and help modernize the industry in compliance with market changes such as JASDEC2025,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;<b>said David Runacres, President of APAC at Broadridge.</b>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;With our history of delivering transformative technology, clients confidently rely on us to provide the critical infrastructure that powers investing, corporate governance and communications.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>ICJ, who provides electronic proxy voting platform services for Japanese issuers and domestic and global institutional investors aiming to digitalize the AGM process, will use Broadridge JASDEC Processing Solution (JASDECPS) for the process of managing proxy voting data and reduce administrative risks and errors, while incorporating the safe and secure handling of subscriber information into the process.</p>
<p>JASDEC is the Central Securities Depository (CSD) responsible for the equities, corporate bond and investment trust settlement infrastructure in Japan. Its upcoming major system changes, referred to as JASDEC2025, are expected to go live by Q1 2026. ICJ will adopt JASDECPS for administrative data flows related to requests for disclosure of shareholder inquiry codes to JASDEC, which are carried out by ICJ on behalf of financial institutions participating in its electronic voting platform.</p>
<p>Broadridge and ICJ offer a range of services to support smooth transitions for clients in the event of such major system changes in capital markets infrastructure.</p>

<title>GCEX Releases Multi-Asset XplorAllocate – A Smarter Way For Fund Managers To Trade And Allocate At Scale</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/gcex-releases-multi-asset-xplorallocate-a-smarter-way-for-fund-managers-to-tra-2025220/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.gc.exchange/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GCEX (GCEX Group)</a>&nbsp;a leading provider of digital assets, foreign exchange solutions and trading technology has launched XplorAllocate,&nbsp; a multi-asset tool designed to help fund managers and professional traders allocate trades more efficiently, accurately, and transparently across crypto spot, crypto derivatives, forex CFDs, and traditional financial products.</p>
<p>Trade allocation has traditionally been a time-consuming and error-prone process. GCEX&rsquo;s XplorAllocate addresses this by streamlining trade execution and allocation, resulting in improved accuracy and enhanced compliance. Instead of managing individual client accounts separately, fund managers and professional traders can now execute a single block trade, which is then automatically allocated across their clients based on their proportional share of the total investment pool - reducing the time spent on this task without having to use a PAMM, MAM, or similar tools. It simplifies workflows and minimises operational risks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="row">
<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Professor Ho for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to the Vassar community.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I am happy to be back on campus. As a teenager in Washington, D.C., I had the very good fortune that a high school counselor pushed me to apply to Vassar College. I was accepted, and I earned my bachelor's degree here. Attending Vassar opened a wider variety of opportunities to me than I would have otherwise had available. But I encountered one problem: Vassar did not offer any banking or business courses, which is what I wanted to study. So, I enrolled in an economics class, figuring it was the next best thing. I was hooked, and I have been studying economics ever since.</p>
<p>My time here as a student was transformative, and I was honored to have served on Vassar's board from 2002 to 2022. Vassar is a vibrant intellectual community.</p>
<p>To motivate the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-roadmap-20250219.PNG" id="fig2">topic</a>&nbsp;of today's speech, let me begin by sharing with you briefly my assessment of the current state of the U.S. economy. The performance of the U.S. economy has been quite strong overall.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Last year, gross domestic product grew at a solid pace of 2.5 percent. I see the labor market as being in a solid position, with job creation steady and the unemployment rate at 4 percent in January. Inflation has come down a great deal over the past two and a half years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent target. Based on recently released data, it is estimated that the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures price index was 2.4 percent in January. Progress toward our 2 percent objective has been slow in the past year. I expect the path of inflation to continue to be bumpy. While a cumulative cut in the policy rate by 100 basis points last year has brought the stance of monetary policy closer to a neutral setting, monetary policy continues to be restrictive. I believe that, with a strong economy and a solid labor market, we can take our time to assess the incoming data to make any further adjustments to our policy rate.</p>
<p>Household consumption grew by 3.2 percent over last year. Understanding the causes of the continued robustness in consumer spending is important because it accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity. Therefore, any accurate forecast of future economic activity would need to get the growth in consumer spending right.</p>
<p>Today, I will discuss one important factor behind the recent strength in consumer spending: households' balance sheets&mdash;that is, their assets, such as stocks, bank accounts, and houses, and their liabilities, such as mortgages, car loans, and other forms of borrowing. At first glance, households appear to be in a strong financial position. Overall, American households currently possess a very high level of wealth that is driven by elevated house values, relatively low overall debt levels, and a strong stock market.</p>
<p>Asset performance and the amount of debt, however, explain only part of the picture. The health of household finances also depends on the cost of new and existing debt and the availability of credit. Household balance sheets are an important factor behind the recent strength in consumer spending. That said, some households may have a difficult time weathering unexpected costs or economic shocks. Looking at a variety of indicators across the income distribution shows that, while, in aggregate, household balance sheets are indeed strong, low- and middle-income households, and those with lower credit scores, may be stretched.</p>
<p>The remainder of my talk is organized as follows. I will begin by discussing household wealth, both in aggregate and across the distribution of income. Then, I connect elevated wealth to recent spending patterns. After that, I discuss the assets side of household balance sheets. Then, I turn to liabilities, including the cost of servicing debt. Next, I discuss households' ability to get new credit and the cost of such credit. Before concluding, I discuss the role of households' balance sheets in the transmission of monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Household Wealth and Its Implications for Spending</strong><br />Let me now turn to the overall picture of household wealth.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure1-20250219.PNG" id="fig3">Figure 1</a>&nbsp;shows a stylized household balance sheet, with assets on the left and liabilities on the right. Net worth, also called wealth, is the difference between the two sides of the balance sheet&mdash;assets less liabilities&mdash;and it is a key indicator of households' financial health. Relative to income, households' net worth is near its highest level in the past 30 years. Total net worth in the U.S. was over $50 trillion higher in the third quarter of last year than it was at the end of 2019. After one accounts for inflation, this accumulation represents an increase in overall wealth of about 20 percent for U.S. households, as shown by the solid black line in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure2-20250219.PNG" id="fig4">figure 2</a>.</p>
<p>These recent gains in household net worth have been broad based across the income distribution. The net worth of low- and middle-income households&mdash;defined as the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution and shown by the dashed red line&mdash;has increased in line with aggregate net worth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Although these households account for 25 percent of total consumption, which is less than their population share, they are still key to the performance of the economy overall.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the implications of household net worth for our understanding of the recent strength in spending.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure3-20250219.PNG" id="fig5">Figure 3</a>&nbsp;shows the saving rate, which measures the share of disposable income&mdash;that is, income after taxes and government transfers&mdash;that households save rather than spend. The saving rate has fluctuated widely over the past few years. It rose during the pandemic, as many households received supplementary income support from the government and some cut back on spending. Then, households spent some of the savings that they had accumulated during the pandemic, leading the saving rate to fall to a relatively low level in 2022. The saving rate has recovered somewhat since then. Now, it hovers around 1 to 1.5 percentage points below its level before the pandemic, indicating that households are still spending more of their income than usual. It seems likely that elevated household wealth helps explain this higher-than-usual spending.</p>
<p>Overall spending has been elevated, but how has high consumption been spread across the income distribution? Recent research shows that the spending of low- and middle-income households has lagged that of higher-income households over the past few years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure4-20250219.PNG" id="fig6">figure 4</a>, although real retail spending growth moved similarly for all households before the pandemic, it has diverged since the middle of 2021. Since then, spending for low-income households moved roughly sideways until the middle of last year, when it began to grow again. High-income households' consumption, by contrast, has grown more consistently over this period.</p>
<p><strong>Assets</strong><br />Having discussed net worth and its implications for spending, now I drill down into the two components of net worth&mdash;household assets and liabilities. With regard to the asset side, elevated net worth largely reflects gains in two important asset categories: stock market holdings and real estate. Each category accounts for roughly one-fourth of households' assets. The stock market valuation has increased at a very rapid pace over the past five years, leading to a $20 trillion rise in the value of households' stock portfolios. As house prices rose, the value of households' real estate has also increased by about the same amount.</p>
<p>Real estate is a particularly important source of wealth for low- and middle-income households, comprising 40 percent of their net worth. Therefore, the growth in real estate wealth over the past five years accounts for a very significant share&mdash;over half&mdash;of the increase in these households' overall wealth. That said, many low-income households do not own their home, and so they did not benefit from the growth in house prices. Equities comprise a smaller share of these households' wealth, and so they account for only around 10 percent of the increase in their wealth.</p>
<p>Wealth allows households to weather unexpected shocks, such as the loss of a job or a surprise bill; however, not all forms of wealth are quickly and easily accessible in case of such emergencies. It can be expensive for households to access the equity that they have in their homes. Also, much of households' stock holdings are in retirement accounts that are difficult to liquidate. So, to understand how resilient households' financial situations are, I also pay close attention to the most liquid components of their net worth, which include bank deposits and money market mutual funds. As the solid black line in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure5-20250219.PNG" id="fig7">figure 5</a>&nbsp;shows, in aggregate, households hold about 20 percent more of these liquid assets than they did before the pandemic. As the dashed red line shows, in contrast to the aggregate, low- and middle-income households have a slightly smaller liquid asset buffer than they did before the pandemic. This smaller buffer suggests that some of these households may not be as equipped to handle economic shocks as they were five years ago. That said, low- and middle-income households still hold more of these assets than they did 10 years ago, when many of them were still recovering from the Great Recession.</p>
<p>On the whole, the asset side of households' balance sheets paints a very healthy picture of their financial positions. Rising house and equity prices have increased net worth for households across the income distribution, and elevated asset valuations seem to help explain strong consumption growth last year.</p>
<p><strong>Liabilities</strong><br />Let me now turn to household liabilities&mdash;what households owe to their lenders.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure6-20250219.PNG" id="fig8">Figure 6</a>&nbsp;plots three major categories of household debt relative to disposable personal income.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;You see home mortgages, the largest share, at the bottom in blue; consumer credit, which includes credit cards, auto loans, student loans in orange; and other consumer loans in beige.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>Total household debt rose through the 2000s and peaked around the time of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. It then began a slow decline as households "deleveraged." The evolution of total debt is driven by mortgage debt, which currently accounts for about 60 percent of total household debt. Mortgage debt levels remain relatively subdued after rising somewhat during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly due to increasing home prices leading borrowers to take out larger loans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure7-20250219.PNG" id="fig9">Figure 7</a>&nbsp;zooms in on revolving credit&mdash;largely, credit card balances&mdash;which is part of the previous "consumer credit" category.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Balances were at about 7 percent of disposable income until the COVID-19 pandemic. Households reduced their spending&mdash;decreasing the need for credit card debt&mdash;and in part used income support programs to pay down existing credit card debt. The result was a nearly 3 percentage point drop in revolving credit relative to disposable personal income. As consumer spending rose and households began to take on more credit card debt, this ratio began to rebound in 2021 but remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Although levels of debt may be low, how costly is it for households to remain current on that debt?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure8-20250219.PNG" id="fig10">Figure 8</a>&nbsp;plots the debt service ratio, which is the amount of required debt payments relative to disposable personal income.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Along with the fall in debt to which I just referred, this ratio plummeted during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has since risen, but it remains about 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. That said, interest payments on revolving debt, which excludes mortgages, have risen over the past few years. The share of disposable personal income going to pay this interest rate is now slightly higher than it was just before the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Availability and Costs</strong><br />So far, I have discussed households' current debt liabilities and how households are able to manage their current debt payments. Even households with elevated levels of assets may wish to obtain new credit. Policymakers and economists often ask, how easy is it for households, in general, to increase their borrowing, and at what cost?</p>
<p>Lenders consider a range of factors in determining whether to supply credit and how much credit to extend. One key factor is the borrower's "credit risk score." These scores, which are calculated by private companies, use information on individuals' past payment behavior and a variety of other factors to create a number that is predictive of their ability to repay debt.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure9-20250219.PNG" id="fig11">Figure 9</a>&nbsp;plots the fraction of individuals with credit risk scores in the subprime, near-prime, and prime categories since 2014. There has been a gradual increase in the fraction of borrowers with prime scores, in part reflecting the deleveraging that I referred to earlier, which is mirrored by the decline in the fraction with subprime scores. As you can see, the fraction of subprime scores took a sharp turn downward at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, many people were able to use the pandemic-era income support programs to become current on their debt and otherwise boost their scores into near-prime and prime categories. This "credit score migration" helped many individuals obtain credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>Before obtaining new credit, people may first turn to lines of credit that they already have&mdash;for example, credit cards.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure10-20250219.PNG" id="fig12">Figure 10</a>&nbsp;plots "utilization rates"&mdash;the ratio of credit card balances to credit limits&mdash;for subprime, near-prime, and prime consumers. Utilization rates fell for all three groups at the beginning of the pandemic but have risen since then and are now somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels for both subprime and near-prime borrowers. These groups may be reluctant to draw down their credit lines further.</p>
<p>It can be challenging to determine the availability of new credit. While the total amount of credit that people have and their new borrowing can be observed, these quantities are determined both by lenders' willingness to supply credit and borrowers' demand for credit. Borrowers taking out fewer new loans may be due to a reduced supply of credit, lower demand for credit, or a combination of the two. Sometimes, however, one of these factors can be identified. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, reductions in household spending and increases in income support programs likely reduced the demand for credit, contributing to the decline in debt levels during that period.</p>
<p>A more systematic method that we have used at the Federal Reserve to help disentangle credit supply from demand has involved questions in our Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, or SLOOS.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;This quarterly survey asks officials who oversee bank lending practices for their institutions about how they have changed loan underwriting standards over the past quarter for a variety of loan categories. "Loan underwriting standards," also known more simply as lending standards, refers to the requirements that banks impose before extending a loan. For example, banks may establish minimum credit risk scores for potential borrowers to qualify for certain kinds of consumer borrowing. Banks that raise minimum credit scores are said to have "tightened" standards and those that lower them to have "eased" standards. Tightening standards likely reduces the supply of credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Because the SLOOS surveys commercial banks, its results are most informative for those loan categories for which banks do a substantial amount of lending. Hence,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure11-20250219.PNG" id="fig13">figure 11</a>&nbsp;shows survey results for consumer loans (credit card and auto loans), averaged together, weighting by balance sheet size.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Banks make almost all credit card loans, and about one-third of auto loans. The figure plots the fraction of banks that have reported tightening less the fraction that have reported easing each quarter, weighted by the bank's loan portfolio&mdash;so that plus-100 percent would indicate that all banks tightened, and minus-100 percent would indicate that all banks eased standards. For both credit cards and auto loans, banks eased standards in the early days of the pandemic but began to tighten them in 2022. More recent responses suggest that banks continued to tighten standards over 2024, making it more difficult for borrowers to obtain new loans. Although this tightening could limit growth in spending by those households that would need more credit cards to do so, recall that higher-credit-score borrowers are not close to exhausting their credit lines. In the most recent survey, banks have eased standards, which could support spending.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy Transmission</strong><br />Now, before I conclude, let me say a few things about how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy has been affecting the cost of borrowing for households. The primary tool that the Federal Reserve uses to influence the economy is the federal funds rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to discuss the appropriate setting of the committee's target range for the federal funds rate. The FOMC's objective when setting this range is to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. Changes in the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate affect overall financial conditions through various channels, including its effect on interest rates that matter for consumers' decisions to purchase houses and cars or borrow on their credit cards. For example, when the FOMC eases monetary policy&mdash;that is, reduces its target for the federal funds rate&mdash;the resulting lower interest rates on consumer loans elicit greater spending on goods and services. Higher spending can, in turn, lead prices to rise. Lower mortgage rates make buying a house more affordable and encourage existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages. Of course, the rates charged on longer-term loans, such as mortgages, are also affected by expectations of how monetary policy and the broader economy will evolve over the duration of the loans, not just by the current level of the federal funds rate.</p>
<p>With respect to lending costs, the reductions in the target range for the federal funds rate last year have begun to pass through to rates on consumer borrowing. In the credit card market, interest rates are floating and are set as a fixed markup over the prime rate. By convention, the prime rate is equal to the upper end of the target range the FOMC sets for the federal funds rate, plus 3 percentage points.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;As seen in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure12-20250219.PNG" id="fig14">figure 12</a>, auto loan and credit card rates have fallen in recent months, with the decline in the prime rate. Rates on auto loans are also influenced by the interest rates on shorter-maturity Treasury securities and risk spreads lenders assess to account for delinquencies and defaults. Auto loan rates have declined, thus far largely because of falls in risk spreads.</p>
<p>In the U.S., mortgages are generally fixed rate and have a longer duration than most other forms of consumer borrowing. Consequently, rates on new and existing loans can differ substantially. As shown by the solid blue line in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-figure13-20250219.PNG" id="fig15">figure 13</a>, the majority of households still have mortgages with rates below 4 percent that were set some time ago. But rates on new mortgages are elevated compared with the ranges observed since the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis, with the current average 30-year fixed rate around 7 percent. As I noted earlier, mortgages' long duration means their rates are driven more by longer-term interest rates, which are in turn determined by many factors beyond just monetary policy. Households who recently became homeowners or moved must bear the cost of paying elevated mortgage rates. As a result, many are not moving.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250219a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>Overall, interest rates for many forms of consumer credit&mdash;with the notable exception of mortgages&mdash;have declined in recent months, starting to show the effects of the recent fall in shorter-term interest rates. Nonetheless, available data suggest that while new credit is available for households with higher credit scores and income levels, those households with lower credit scores and income levels are finding it relatively more difficult to obtain credit.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />Let's return to the title question: How strong are households' balance sheets? Generally, households appear to be in a good position: Asset holdings are high across the income distribution, driven by high house and equity prices, and debt levels are subdued. Interest rates on some forms of debt have begun to come down, and required debt service is low as a share of income. That said, some households appear to be stretched. Lower-credit-score households' utilization rates are elevated, and banks have tightened loan underwriting standards on some forms of credit. And even though, as a group, low- and middle-income households possess elevated levels of overall wealth, they have less of a buffer of liquid assets than they did before the pandemic. These indicators suggest that certain groups of households may have a hard time weathering unexpected costs or economic shocks.</p>
<p>In closing, let me reiterate that it is important to monitor closely the strength of household balance sheets, which inform forecasts of overall economic activity. Strong balance sheets help support consumption spending, which in turn can help deliver the economic growth that puts the Federal Reserve in the best position to achieve its policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.</p>

<p>Founded in 2007, Nodal Exchange is a derivatives exchange and a leader in innovation, having introduced the world&rsquo;s largest sets of electric power locational (nodal) futures contracts and environmental contracts. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, Nodal Exchange currently offers over 1,000 power contracts on hundreds of unique locations, providing the most effective basis risk management available to market participants. The majority of U.S. power futures open interest is on Nodal Exchange with 1.43 billion MWh representing 57% market share as of the end of January 2025. In addition, Nodal Exchange offers natural gas and environmental contracts. All Nodal Exchange contracts are cleared by Nodal Clear, which is a CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) registered derivatives clearing organization and a wholly owned subsidiary of Nodal Exchange.&nbsp; Nodal Clear is also the clearing house for Coinbase Derivatives. Nodal Exchange is a designated contract market regulated by the CFTC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to Nodal Exchange on your expansion and thank you for being a vital part of Fairfax County&rsquo;s dynamic and innovative business community.&rdquo;&nbsp;said Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeffrey C. McKay.&nbsp;&ldquo;Your groundbreaking work in energy and financial markets showcases the excellence that defines our community and inspires economic growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to celebrate Nodal Exchange&rsquo;s second expansion in Fairfax County in three years&rdquo;&nbsp;said Victor Hoskins, president and CEO of Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA). &ldquo;Their achievements highlight the strength of Fairfax County as a hub for business excellence, and we look forward to seeing the continued impact that Nodal Exchange will have both on our local economy and community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FCEDA worked with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) to secure the project for Virginia. VEDP will support Nodal Exchange&rsquo;s job creation through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vedp.org/incentive/virginia-jobs-investment-program-vjip">Virginia Jobs Investment Program (VJIP)</a>, which provides consultative services and funding to companies creating new jobs in order to support employee recruitment and training activities. As a business incentive supporting economic development, VJIP reduces the human resource costs of new and expanding companies. VJIP is state-funded, demonstrating Virginia&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing job opportunities for citizens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nodal&nbsp;Exchange&rsquo;s expansion in Fairfax County demonstrates Virginia&rsquo;s ability to attract and retain global financial technology leaders,&rdquo; said Governor Glenn Youngkin. &ldquo;As North America&rsquo;s largest power futures&nbsp;exchange,&nbsp;Nodal&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;showcases how international firms can thrive in the Commonwealth while developing innovative solutions for the world&rsquo;s energy markets. This expansion reinforces Virginia&rsquo;s position as a premier location for businesses at the intersection of finance and technology.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Capital Markets &amp; The Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia, February 19, 2025, Opening Remarks, Scott O’Malia, ISDA Chief Executive</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/capital-markets-and-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia-february-19-2025-opening-remark-2025219/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, everyone. I&rsquo;d like to add my thanks to Saudi Tadawul Group for working with us on this event, as well as all our sponsors for supporting us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very excited to be holding this event with ICMA, ISLA and Saudi Tadawul Group, because it comes at a critical time for the development of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Saudi authorities published netting legislation that we think sets the foundation for vibrant, robust capital markets &ndash; a big step to achieving one of the Saudi Vision 2030 strategic objectives to ensure the formation of an advanced capital market.</p>
<p>Derivatives play a central role in that &ndash; they&rsquo;re vital for healthy, competitive and liquid financial markets and help spur economic growth. They offer companies the ability to raise financing at the best rate, reduce costs and manage risks, giving those firms the confidence to borrow, invest and hire.</p>
<p>According to a new report we&rsquo;ll shortly publish to mark our 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary, 87% of nearly 1,200 companies across seven major stock indices use OTC derivatives for a variety of purposes. That includes blue-chip multinational corporations, agricultural companies, asset managers, pension funds and banks.</p>
<p>This vast universe of companies all over the world use derivatives because they find them useful, and because they create value by enhancing predictability and protecting against losses.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is among the world&rsquo;s top 20 economies, but the country&rsquo;s derivatives market remains relatively small, with OTC interest rate derivatives turnover accounting for approximately 0.01% of the global daily average in 2022.</p>
<p>We think there&rsquo;s a significant opportunity here. But for derivatives markets to grow, we first need to have robust foundations in place &ndash; which is why publication of the Saudi netting legislation is so important.</p>
<p>By allowing counterparties to offset their various obligations into a single net amount owed by one party to the other, netting significantly reduces credit risk and increases the capacity for firms to lend and trade.</p>
<p>Since our inception 40 years ago, ISDA has worked with authorities around the world to make the case for netting and develop the necessary legislation to ensure its enforceability. Saudi Arabia is no exception, and I&rsquo;m proud to say that &ndash; in line with many other jurisdictions &ndash; the country&rsquo;s netting legislation is based on ISDA&rsquo;s Model Netting Act, which acts as a template for those jurisdictions wanting to enshrine netting enforceability into domestic law.</p>
<p>With the legislation now finalized, ISDA will shortly publish a netting opinion, adding to our 90 existing opinions around the globe. This will be for conventional and Islamic derivatives with Saudi counterparties.</p>
<p>This is critical. Regulators allow close-out netting to be risk-reducing for the purposes of capital requirements, so long as there is a high degree of legal certainty over the enforceability of close-out netting under the local law in each jurisdiction. A clean netting opinion gives firms that certainty, encouraging greater participation in local capital markets by foreign and domestic institutions, boosting competition and liquidity.</p>
<p>We strongly believe certainty on close-out netting creates the foundations for safe, efficient and liquid derivatives markets &ndash; in turn, leading to a robust and vibrant ecosystem for capital markets funding and hedging.</p>
<p>But, as important as close-out netting is, other steps are also necessary to establish deep and liquid derivatives markets. Local policymakers need to determine the scope of permitted activity, whether registration requirements are necessary and what disclosure standards should apply. Broader regulatory issues &ndash; for example, whether to introduce clearing, margin or reporting mandates for OTC derivatives &ndash; also need to be considered, as well as expectations on risk governance and management.</p>
<p>We commend the Saudi authorities for their work so far and stand ready to help as they consider further initiatives to promote a safe and efficient derivatives market.</p>
<p>Companies, financial institutions and governments around the world rely on access to capital markets to finance growth and create stability in their business and activities. Derivatives are a critical component of healthy capital markets, enabling firms to lock in the cost of issuing debt and transfer risk, encouraging them to lend, borrow and invest with confidence.</p>
<p>Saudi authorities have taken a very important step to realizing the objective of advanced capital markets outlined in Vision 2030, and the future looks very bright indeed. Today&rsquo;s event is a great opportunity to discuss these issues, share best practices and highlight possible next steps in developing vibrant, liquid and competitive capital markets.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank you all for coming today, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to the conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Natural Resources And Innovation Companies Central To Global Economic Interests, The Annual TSX Venture 50™ Ranking Shows - TSX Venture Exchange Releases The 2025 TSX Venture 50, Canada's Top-Performing Growth Stage Public Companies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="sizeable">Canada's natural resources and technology-driven businesses continue to shape the country's economy. Today, TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) announced the 2025 TSX Venture 50&trade;, spotlighting how mining and innovation companies are advancing Canada's long-term economic agenda and global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"The performance of the TSX Venture 50 underscores the strategic importance of Canadian natural resources and high-growth innovation," said Tim Babcock, President, TSX Venture Exchange. "With heightened demand for critical minerals, energy security and transition, and advanced manufacturing, this year's TSX Venture 50 showcases how TSXV is empowering Canadian businesses to raise capital, scale operations, and contribute to a secure and prosperous future for Canada."</p>
<p class="sizeable">The TSX Venture 50, a ranking of the 50 top-performing early- and growth-stage companies, assesses each issuer's performance in 2024 across three key indicators&mdash;market capitalization growth, share price appreciation, and Canadian consolidated trading value. Collectively, the 2025 TSX Venture 50 companies represent a combined market capitalization of $21.7 billion as at December 31, 2024, a surge of over $16 billion (up 289%) in just one year. During that same period, these companies delivered an average share price appreciation of 207%, far outpacing the 121% growth seen in 2023 and 73% in 2022.</p>
<h3 class="sizeable">Top Performer: Kraken Robotics Inc.</h3>
<p class="sizeable">Securing the overall top spot on the 2025 TSX Venture 50 is Kraken Robotics Inc. (TSXV:PNG), a marine technology pioneer headquartered in Newfoundland. Kraken's market capitalization soared by 437% last year&mdash;adding more than $587 million&mdash;as it accelerated key growth strategies and expanded globally. This is Kraken's fourth appearance on the TSX Venture 50 since listing on TSXV in 2015 with an initial valuation of $10.6 million.</p>
<h3 class="sizeable">Mining sector continues to shine</h3>
<p class="sizeable">A defining theme in the 2025 ranking is the dominance of mining companies, which account for 31 out of the 50 top performers. Many are focused on critical minerals (nickel, copper, and uranium) and precious metals (gold and silver)&mdash;resources crucial to long-term energy security, advanced manufacturing, and industrial technologies. Collectively, these mining companies have increased their market capitalization to $8.1 billion, marking a 174% increase last year, driven by strong financing activity and trading volumes. More than 80% of these issuers raised capital on TSXV in 2024 to help realize their growth objectives and meet a rising global demand for essential resources.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Among these leaders is Artemis Gold Inc. (TSXV:ARTG), a gold development company with a wholly owned project in central British Columbia. Artemis recorded the highest consolidated value traded of any TSX Venture 50 issuer in 2024, with $1.3 billion worth of shares traded.</p>
<h3 class="sizeable">Innovation sectors gain momentum</h3>
<p class="sizeable">Beyond mining, the second-largest cohort includes technology (5), clean technology &amp; renewable energy (4), and life sciences (3) companies. These high-growth innovation businesses posted some of the most impressive share price and market cap gains on TSXV in 2024. Clean technology &amp; renewable energy and technology issuers on the list saw the highest average share price growth last year&mdash;400% and 345%, respectively&mdash;highlighting continued investor interest in public companies driving energy transition and scaling in-demand technologies.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Among the standouts is SPARQ Systems Inc. (TSXV:SPRQ), a Kingston, ON-based provider of advanced power electronics for the renewable energy sector, which recorded the highest increases in share price (944%) and market capitalization (1,379%) of any company on this year's list.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Other highlights from the 2025 TSX Venture 50:</p>
<ul class="sizeable">
<li><span>Homegrown champions:</span>&nbsp;46 of the 50 ranked companies are headquartered in Canada, with the largest concentration in British Columbia (23), Ontario (15), and Alberta (5). This speaks to the importance of early- and growth-stage firms on TSXV in fueling economic growth, innovation, and job creation in their communities.</li>
<li><span>BC in the spotlight:</span>&nbsp;Almost half (46%) of this year's TSX Venture 50 companies are headquartered in British Columbia, with 20 of 23 operating in the mining sector. This underscores the province's global leadership in resource exploration and development.</li>
<li><span>Global footprint:</span>&nbsp;At least 40 of the companies on this year's list operate outside Canada&mdash;across Europe, South America, Africa, and beyond&mdash;highlighting the global impact of investing in TSXV-listed companies.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), a leading global financial markets infrastructure and data provider, today announces Deutsche Bank has selected its Trade Discovery solution, a key tool for compliance for the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) regulation.</p>
<p>The FRTB regulation requires institutions implementing the rules via their own market risk models, to access accurate and comprehensive data on cross-asset class financial instruments traded in both regulated and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Our Trade Discovery solution aggregates this critical data from a variety of sources, including regulated markets, &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; OTC markets, and &ldquo;opaque&rdquo; OTC markets. LSEG has extensive coverage across exchange-traded and OTC derivative instruments through LCH and Tradeweb as well as through strategic partnerships with other providers such as Fenics Market Data, and Parameta Solutions.</p>
<p>Trade Discovery provides access to billions of data points spanning rates, credit, FX and equities, across multiple jurisdictions &ndash; empowering banks to meet FRTB&rsquo;s rigorous data requirements. The offering has been independently audited, ensuring that its data solution meets the high standards required for FRTB compliance, providing Deutsche Bank &ndash; and the broader market- with confidence and reliability of the data.</p>
<p><span>Fausto Marseglia, Head of Product Management, FRTB and Regulatory Propositions at LSEG,</span>&nbsp;commented &ldquo;We are excited that Deutsche Bank has chosen our Trade Discovery solution for their FRTB needs. The independent audit of our solution reaffirms its accuracy and regulatory compliance. With our broad data coverage and trusted partnerships with major global market infrastructure providers, we are confident that we can help Deutsche Bank meet the complex requirements of FRTB.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Piers Robson, FRTB Initiative Director at Deutsche Bank,</span>&nbsp;commented &ldquo;LSEG&rsquo;s Trade Discovery solution provides us with comprehensive and trusted data to ensure our market risk models comply with regulation while supporting our fixed income business to retain its competitive edge in a dynamic market environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For most banks, the biggest FRTB data gap is in over-the-counter (OTC) products. Legacy technology infrastructure, data governance issues, and other challenges can mean that working with a trusted data partner will reduce the time and resources needed to achieve FRTB compliance. Our position as a leading provider of these data solutions for FRTB compliance underscores the market&rsquo;s growing confidence in our ability to meet the evolving regulatory demands of the financial services industry.</p>

<title>Artificial Intelligence Alone Not The ‘Silver Bullet’ As Compliance Chiefs Wrestle With Rising Costs And Complexity</title>

<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<ul>
<li><span>87% of firms globally expect Know Your Customer Enhanced Due Diligence (KYC EDD) budgets to rise over the next 12 months.</span></li>
<li><span>90% say the volume of EDD requests has risen over the last three years.</span></li>
<li><span>AI is viewed as an important tool to increase efficiency, but the human element is key to ensuring compliance accuracy and risk mitigation.</span></li>
<li><span>AI, once safely implemented will speed up reporting, improve ongoing monitoring, identify hidden risks, and reduce overall program costs.</span></li>
<li><span>Sanctions, data privacy and crypto were identified as the biggest hurdles in the KYC compliance space going forward.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>Growing levels of financial crime and regulatory scrutiny are forcing organisations to step up spending on compliance, but they are less sold on AI as the standalone solution, according to a global survey of risk and compliance officers by LSEG Risk Intelligence.</p>
<p>The survey finds that 87% of respondents expect their organisation&rsquo;s annual budgets for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/risk-intelligence/due-diligence-services/kyc">Know Your Customer Enhanced Due Diligence</a>&nbsp;(KYC EDD) to increase over the next 12 months, with an average expected increase of 5.2%.</p>
<p>The average annual EDD spend is currently US$632,026 &ndash; rising to over US$900,000 for organisations that turn over more than US$1 billion. The demand for compliance checks has taken its toll, too &ndash; with 90% of respondents reporting an increase in requests over the last three years.</p>
<p>However, as compliance teams look to technology to streamline due diligence, the survey finds trusted human oversight is still paramount. 58% believe KYC EDD should be mostly or fully human-driven, compared to 42% who think KYC EDD should be either fully or mostly AI-automated.</p>
<p><span>Daniel Hartnett, Head of Enhanced Due Diligence at LSEG Risk Intelligence, comments:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Our research shows that higher spend and rising volumes of Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) requests are anticipated &ndash; and as many organisations struggle with doing more with less, there is a now an urgent need to control costs, while remaining compliant and not compromising the quality of EDD.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While at first glance, AI appears to be a silver bullet, a more nuanced approach is needed &ndash; one that is human-centric in nature. AI undoubtedly offers a range of core benefits in the EDD space, but it must be implemented safely and responsibly, with trusted human oversight throughout. To do otherwise will lead to more risk, not less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many respondents believe that once a responsible, safe strategy for AI risk mitigation is in place, AI will offer a range of core benefits in the EDD space, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster turnaround times for generating comprehensive reports (cited by 41%).</li>
<li>Ongoing monitoring and automatic updates of due diligence data (cited by 37%).</li>
<li>An enhanced ability to uncover hidden risks or patterns (cited by 36%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cost savings (cited by 35%).</li>
<li>Although AI is viewed as an important tool to increase efficiency, the survey underscores that &ldquo;Responsible AI&rdquo; is key to ensuring compliance accuracy and risk mitigation.</li>

<p>As the compliance landscape evolves, organisations identified key concerns that will create challenges in the KYC EDD space moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>49% highlighted increased global sanctions and watchlists.</li>
<li>48% selected increasing customer privacy concerns and data protection laws.</li>
<li>43% cited the expansion of digital currencies and crypto transactions.</li>

<p>Over the next three years, organisations expect KYC EDD programs to be shaped by two key drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>52% highlighted an increased focus on identifying beneficial ownership and complex corporate structures.</li>
<li>50% cited a greater reliance on technology and data analytics to manage rising volumes of customer data.</li>
</ul>
<p>As financial crime risks increase and regulations tighten, firms must adopt cost-effective and scalable due diligence solutions while ensuring they maintain compliance with evolving global standards.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="newsc">
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today outlined 12 major initiatives to enhance the security, innovation and growth of Hong Kong&rsquo;s virtual asset (VA) market under a five- pillar&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/News-and-announcements/Policy-statements-and-announcements/A-S-P-I-Re-for-a-brighter-future-SFCs-regulatory-roadmap-for-Hong-Kongs-virtual-asset-market" target="_blank">&ldquo;<span>ASPIRe</span>&rdquo; roadmap</a>, which stands for&nbsp;<span>A</span>ccess,&nbsp;<span>S</span>afeguards,&nbsp;<span>P</span>roducts,&nbsp;<span>I</span>nfrastructure and&nbsp;<span>Re</span>lationships (see Appendix).</p>
<p>The initiatives will streamline access for global liquidity, enable adaptive compliance and product frameworks focusing on security, and drive infrastructure upgrades for traditional finance to tap into blockchain efficiency.</p>
<p>Under the roadmap, new frameworks for regulating VA over-the-counter and VA custodian services will be developed, while VA product and service offerings will be expanded. Other measures encompass optimisation of operational requirements for VA trading platforms, combatting illicit activities, investor education and proactive stakeholder engagement (Note 1).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adhering to the core principles of investor protection, sustainable liquidity and adaptive regulation, the roadmap in itself is a calibrated response to emerging VA market challenges and thus helps future-proof our ecosystem,&rdquo; said Dr Eric Yip, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The roadmap is not a final destination but a living blueprint, one that invites collective efforts to advance Hong Kong&rsquo;s vision as a global hub where innovation thrives within guardrails,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>As part of its engagement efforts under the &ldquo;<span>Re</span>lationships&rdquo; pillar, the SFC has recently conducted constructive dialogue with senior management of all licensed virtual asset trading platforms at the inaugural meeting of the Virtual Asset Consultative Panel. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=25PR17" target="_blank">SFC&rsquo;s press release</a>&nbsp;issued on 14 February 2025 for details.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Board of Governors (BoG) of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), at its meeting today, approved the revision framework for confidence-building measures initially implemented in 2024. The Board has thoroughly considered holistic approaches and measures to ensure appropriate implementation aligning with prevailing market conditions, aiming to strengthen investor confidence and create stability in the Thai stock market. As the next step, SET will conduct a public consultation with stakeholders before submitting the proposals to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for approval. Implementation is expected by the late second quarter of this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key highlights of the approved measures include:</p>
<p><b>(1)&nbsp; </b><b>Short-selling Supervision</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Revised eligibility for short-selling to include <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only SET100 index securities</span>, compared to the current criteria which allow short-selling of both SET-100 securities and qualified non-SET100 securities (those with a three-month average market capitalization of at least THB 7.5 billion (approx. USD 222.24 million), minimum monthly turnover of 2 percent over 12 months, and minimum free float of 20 percent of paid-up capital).</li>
<li>Introduction of a conditional uptick rule: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zero-plus tick will be the default</span>, but will switch to the uptick rule when a stock's price falls beyond a specified threshold (e.g., &ge;X% from the previous day's closing price) for the following trading day.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(2)&nbsp; </b><b>High Frequency Trading (HFT) Regulations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Registered HFT participants will be eligible to trade <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only SET100 stocks</span>, with exceptions for market makers and certain security types.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(3)&nbsp; </b><b>Relaxation of 2024 Measures</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Revocation of the Minimum Resting Time measure.</li>
<li>Postponement of Phase 2 implementation of the Dynamic Price Band measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure policy confidence, SET will maintain both existing and newly revised measures until the next review in 2026.</p>

Conducted by the IOSCO Assessment Committee, this Thematic Review assessed the consistency of outcomes arising from the implementation by market authorities in 34 IOSCO member jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Review found that most market authorities have implemented the recommendations and have made significant progress in addressing technological challenges to market surveillance, particularly in more complex markets.</p>
<p>However, some issues of concern were identified, noting that some regulators lack the necessary organizational and technical capabilities to conduct effective surveillance of their markets in the midst of rapid technological developments.</p>
<p>The absence of regular review of the surveillance capabilities of market authorities was also identified as an issue of concern. For some markets with multiple trading venues, difficulties were identified for the collection and comparison of data across these venues. The inability of many regulators to map their cross-border surveillance capabilities was also identified as an issue of concern, given the risks in an increasingly globalized financial landscape.</p>
<p>Jean-Paul Servais, IOSCO Board Chair, stated: &ldquo;Securities regulators must always endeavour to keep abreast of technological developments affecting their markets. I am pleased that IOSCO&rsquo;s review highlights the significant progress made by the majority of our members in addressing technological challenges to market surveillance in line with IOSCO&rsquo;s 2013 recommendations. In today&rsquo;s borderless environment, regulators need both organizational and technical capabilities to conduct effective surveillance of their markets. Systematic and robust analysis of accessible, reliable and good quality data should remain a priority for all securities regulators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurent van Burik, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Assessment Committee, said: &ldquo;Market surveillance has made significant improvements over the years in different jurisdictions, yet the challenge of addressing market abuse remains significant for market authorities, especially in the wake of rapid technological advances. IOSCO members should ensure that they have adequate and up-to-date powers, tools, and resources for effective market surveillance.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Financial markets will be modernised to drive capital market competitiveness and deliver growth &ndash; the priority of the government&rsquo;s Plan for Change.</span></p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chancellor hosts senior representatives of investment banking and asset management sectors in No11 to hone Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meeting comes as government goes further and faster to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change by speeding up settlement of securities trading, such as buying and selling shares.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change brings the UK in line with best-in-class international markets such as the US, strengthens capital markets competitiveness, and cut costs for investors.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In a meeting with the country&rsquo;s top bankers, the Chancellor set out a plan to speed up settlement of securities trades which will make the UK&rsquo;s capital markets more competitive to drive economic growth through the Plan for Change and put more money into people&rsquo;s pockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy &ndash; one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group &ndash; confirming that the UK will move to a &lsquo;T+1&rsquo; standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027.</p>
<p>The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed &ndash; instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades.</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people&rsquo;s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe.</p>
<p>The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts.</p>
<p>The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible.</p>
<h4 id="notes-to-editors">Notes to editors&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Stakeholder commentary:</p>
<p><strong>Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU.&nbsp;Based on Citi&rsquo;s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO &amp; Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the Chancellor&rsquo;s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government&rsquo;s efforts to make it happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the UK Government&rsquo;s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional notes:</p>

<title>ICAEW Partners Securities Commission Malaysia To Strengthen Expertise In Sustainability Disclosures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) have initiated a collaboration through a Letter of Intent to collaborate in certain areas.</p>
<p>This collaboration focuses on capacity-building, with ICAEW providing specialised training on climate-related financial disclosures, the provision of a programme to obtain Sustainability Certifications, the use of ICAEW training films and other areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, ICAEW conducted a workshop on 14 February 2025 at the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF) Chairs Meeting in Penang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This workshop covered key sustainability disclosure requirements and regulatory best practices, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>IFRS S1 and S2 standards for climate and sustainability-related disclosures </li>
<li>Scope 3 emissions reporting and measurement challenges </li>
<li>The impact of global climate regulations, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) </li>
<li>The role of regulators in sustainability policy and stakeholder engagement </li>
</ul>
<p>This collaboration is timely as Malaysia has assumed the ASEAN Chairmanship for 2025, under the theme &ldquo;Inclusivity and Sustainability.&rdquo;&nbsp; With global ESG standards evolving, equipping regulators with the right expertise is crucial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICAEW Chief Executive Alan Vallance welcomed this milestone, stating, &ldquo;Trust, ethics, and sustainability must be at the core of capital markets. Sustainability is not just about compliance&mdash;it is a business imperative that drives resilience, innovation, and long-term success. Through this collaboration with the Securities Commission Malaysia, ICAEW reaffirms its commitment to strengthening regulatory expertise in sustainability across ASEAN.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This collaboration will equip regulators with the tools and insights needed to align with global ESG standards while ensuring that regulation remains supportive, not punitive. By fostering capacity-building, knowledge-sharing, and sustainable finance innovation, we can work together to build an interconnected, inclusive, and resilient ASEAN capital market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Echoing this sentiment, SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi, highlighted the need to upskill regulators:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malaysia&rsquo;s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025 presents an opportunity to drive sustainability and financial resilience. Our collaboration with ICAEW ensures we stay ahead of global standards while equipping regulators to support market participants. Together, we can strengthen ASEAN&rsquo;s capital markets and investor confidence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As ICAEW continues to champion sustainability and professional excellence worldwide, this partnership exemplifies its role in empowering financial professionals, policymakers, and regulators with the tools needed to drive meaningful change.

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For December</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-december-2025219/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-december-2025219/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for December 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for January 2025, is scheduled for March 19, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in December of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $87.1 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $162.5 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $75.3 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in December; their net purchases were $79.6 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $130.5 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $50.9 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $7.6 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $72.0 billion in December.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $16.8 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $22.0 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased&nbsp;by $6.8 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system</a></p>
<h3>About TIC Data</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated rapidly over the past few years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is now commonplace to see autonomous vehicles navigating city streets, and generative AI tools are available on phones and other devices wherever we go. AI innovations make headlines and play a big role in financial markets, and generative AI has the potential to change how we think about productivity, labor markets and the macroeconomy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Today, I will address that question by outlining two hypothetical scenarios for AI's impact and the implications for businesses, regulators, and society. I will focus my comments on Generative AI, or GenAI, a subset of AI that has seen significant growth and integration into economic activity in just a few short years.</p>
<p><strong>GenAI and Its Adoption</strong><br />Compared to earlier iterations of AI, GenAI is able to generate content, which allows it to significantly enhance productivity across a range of knowledge-based activities and be used by people without coding skills. GenAI will likely become a "general purpose technology," with widespread adoption, continuous improvement, and productivity enhancements to a wide range of sectors across the economy. We are already seeing GenAI improve the productivity of its own R&amp;D.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;There is widespread enthusiasm for GenAI, and survey evidence shows much faster rates of consumer adoption of GenAI already than were seen for the personal computer or the internet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;While actual deployment of GenAI is limited to some business functions, and there have been pitfalls along the way, businesses in almost every sector are experimenting with or considering how to make use of the technology.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Firms are also exploring Agentic AI&mdash;Gen AI systems that not only produce new content, but are also able to proactively pursue goals by generating innovative solutions and acting upon them at speed and scale.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Imagining Agentic AI's ultimate application, some speculate that we could experience a "country of geniuses in a data center"&mdash;a collective intelligence that surpasses human capabilities in problem-solving and collaboration.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Some believe Agentic AI has the potential to connect ideas in disparate domains, potentially transforming research and development and society more broadly.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p><strong>Hypothetical Scenarios Considering How GenAI Could Evolve</strong><br />Today, I will outline two hypothetical scenarios for considering how GenAI could evolve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;In one, we see only incremental adoption that primarily augments what humans do today, but still leads to widespread productivity gains. In the other, we see transformative change where we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences. For each scenario, I consider the potential implications for the economy and financial sector.</p>
<p>Thinking through hypothetical scenarios can help widen our lens to a range of possible outcomes and provide a framework for assessing the balance between benefits and risks. Scenarios are not predictions of the future, but provide a framework for analyzing the factors that could lead to different outcomes. Reality is complex. GenAI adoption rates will vary across industries, leading to diverse impacts on market structures. Elements of both scenarios will likely come to pass, and play out at different rates, which will influence the effects on the economy and society. In the short term, GenAI may be overhyped, while in the long run, it may be underappreciated. And, of course, things might turn out differently from these hypotheticals.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothetical 1: Incremental Progress with Widespread Productivity Gains</strong><br />First, let me begin with the incremental scenario, where GenAI primarily augments work in existing processes and leads to steady and widespread productivity gains, but does not fundamentally unlock new capabilities or transform the economy.</p>
<p>In this state of the world, GenAI tools enhance efficiency and enable more personalized solutions across industries, in ways that have incremental&mdash;but still meaningful&mdash;effects on people's lives. For instance, in customer service, professional writing&mdash;but not this speech&mdash;and software engineering, GenAI-powered tools are already supporting workers, improving accuracy and speed, and these effects could spread to other sectors.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In this world, health care sees significant improvements as GenAI reduces administrative burdens, assists with diagnostics, and personalizes treatment plans based on real-time patient data. Medicines and other treatments are developed at a faster pace.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Education is similarly affected, as GenAI alleviates administrative tasks for teachers, allows lessons to be tailored to individual students, and permits students to learn by doing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;In manufacturing, GenAI-optimized supply chains anticipate and adjust more quickly to disruptions, and current manufacturing processes are refined through virtual iteration.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;In materials science, GenAI-driven experimentation accelerates the discovery of new materials, leading to advances in everything from construction to electronics.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;Turning to the financial sector, we could see similar productivity gains. Community banks leverage GenAI-powered chatbots to provide customized financial advice rooted in local knowledge, while institutions of all sizes continue to advance use of GenAI for compliance monitoring, fraud detection, risk management, and document analysis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>The impact to society would be incrementally positive in this state of the world. Humans would use GenAI as a tool to deliver goods and services that we currently produce in a more efficient way. Productivity would go up. The economy would grow at a faster pace.<span><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16">16</a><a name="f16"></a></span></p>
<p>What does this mean for the labor force? The impact will depend on the industry and the nature of the job. GenAI experiments suggest the technology holds the promise of levelling up skills and bringing productivity of lower-performing workers into line with higher performing workers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;In other cases, it could augment the highest performers, leaving them more time for creativity or strategic aspects of their roles. Increasing automation for certain tasks may displace some workers, where certain skills can be replicated by GenAI. Historically, as technology has replaced some jobs, it has augmented existing roles or created new ones.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;However, this is not to downplay the individual cost for workers who need to retrain, find other employment, or change careers in response to major changes in labor demand. Society will need to account for these possible effects of AI.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the economy? As I noted before, the economy should grow, if the incremental productivity gains are widespread. However, in this scenario, it is possible that the expected value creation from GenAI was overhyped, anticipating transformative breakthroughs rather than incremental productivity gains. This could trigger market corrections for the firms that have heavily invested in this technology if reality doesn't measure up to expectations. While the U.S. economy experienced a surge of productivity growth during the dot.com boom in the late 1990s, it was followed by a wave of bankruptcies, capital overhang, and a cautious business investment climate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;The effects of the ensuing recession were widespread.</p>
<p>What does this mean for financial stability and other financial risks? In this incremental scenario, GenAI may magnify both the vulnerabilities and sources of resilience that already exist in the system. Attractive trades become more crowded, but risk managers gain new insights.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Malicious actors gain new tools, but cyber defenders become better armed. So long as financial regulators, enterprise risk managers, and others charged with managing downside risks prioritize efforts to keep pace with the evolving financial ecosystem, there's nothing to suggest a wholesale transformation of the balance of risks. Of course, keeping pace will pose challenges, and it's important that we all focus on the need to meet these risks.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothetical Scenario 2: Transformative Change</strong><br />Now, let's consider a more dramatic hypothetical scenario, in which GenAI adoption extends beyond improving on what we currently do, and provides new expertise and capabilities that have transformative effects on the economy and society. In this scenario, humans deploy their imagination and creativity&mdash;combined with robust investment in research and development&mdash;to deploy intelligent GenAI systems to make rapid breakthroughs in, for example, biotechnology, robotics, and energy, fundamentally reshaping existing industries and creating new ones. In this instance, to focus the mind, we can think of GenAI as no longer only a tool for scientists to analyze data&mdash;in a sense, it becomes the scientist, directing the research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>For instance, let's say that GenAI applications in health care do not simply improve how we currently deliver care, but also enable therapies that target genetic mutations and cure diseases previously considered incurable.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Similarly, manufacturing evolves to create GenAI-driven robotic factories, with goods produced with new materials and atomic precision.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;Materials science is transformed through the discovery of programmable materials and self-healing substances, all of which reshape construction, technology, and consumer goods.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, GenAI optimizes fusion energy research, expediting the shift to sustainable energy sources.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a>&nbsp;And GenAI helps to create the next generation of quantum computing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn26" title="footnote 26"><span>26</span></a><a name="f26"></a>&nbsp;In that way, GenAI improves its own energy sources and computing capabilities, enabling it to become a more powerful creative tool.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn27" title="footnote 27"><span>27</span></a><a name="f27"></a></p>
<p>Finance also looks radically different than it does today. Individuals with access to hyper-personalized financial planning and businesses with innovative products and services seamlessly connect with one another through near-frictionless or novel forms of financial intermediation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn28" title="footnote 28"><span>28</span></a><a name="f28"></a>&nbsp;Trading strategies and risk-management practices are boosted by greater GenAI-based analytic tools that have dynamic real-time access to an enormous knowledge base in both the public and private domains.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn29" title="footnote 29"><span>29</span></a><a name="f29"></a></p>
<p>Although this transformative scenario is more speculative and is accompanied by a far greater degree of uncertainty than the first, it is important to consider given the extraordinary opportunities for human advancement and welfare that could arise, even if just one of its transformative components were to come to fruition. We would need to fundamentally reimagine how the economy is structured.</p>
<p>What are the impacts on the labor force, in a world where GenAI's capabilities extend beyond what humans can accomplish today? Humans may have a role to manage multi-agent GenAI frameworks, or fill gaps where GenAI solutions remain expensive or inefficient for some applications. But this is a world where some workers may see their current jobs disappearing. It is also a world in which they may see their own work transformed and have many more choices about the work they do. The nature of labor would radically change, and this will require us to have broader conversations about how to organize the economy. These conversations should wrestle with how to navigate major economic shifts in a way that recognizes the impact on the human condition, and the extent to which people derive their communities, friendships, personal sense of meaning and dignity from their work.</p>
<p>What about the competitive landscape? There is probably a greater likelihood that rewards for businesses would be distributed more unevenly at first, as significant breakthroughs with far-reaching ramifications may benefit a subset of firms and industries and concentrate economic power in firms that control GenAI breakthroughs. If only a handful of firms have the ability to accomplish the incredible things I've mentioned above, they may dominate markets and crowd out competitors. To the extent that GenAI becomes broadly effective, widely available, and cheap, these market advantages could lessen over time if the right regulatory environment supports competitive market dynamics.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn30" title="footnote 30"><span>30</span></a><a name="f30"></a>&nbsp;But history suggests caution in this regard; a handful of players may dominate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn31" title="footnote 31"><span>31</span></a><a name="f31"></a></p>
<p>And finally, for finance, we should anticipate fundamental changes in this scenario. When it's working well, the financial system helps move money and risk through time and space.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn32" title="footnote 32"><span>32</span></a><a name="f32"></a>&nbsp;To the extent there are fundamental changes to how the economy is organized, we could need a new set of institutions, markets, and products to facilitate transactions among households, businesses, and GenAI agents.</p>
<p><strong>What Should We Do?</strong><br />Among the many ways in which we can help to harness the potential benefits of GenAI and minimize its risks, I will highlight only a couple today.</p>
<p>Financial institutions, and the Federal Reserve System, should consider investing sufficient resources in understanding GenAI technology, incorporating it into their workflows where appropriate, and training staff on how to use the technology responsibly and effectively.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn33" title="footnote 33"><span>33</span></a><a name="f33"></a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the financial regulatory community should approach the changing landscape with agility and flexibility. And beyond the financial sector, collaboration between governments, private industry, and research institutions will be critical to ensure that GenAI systems are not weaponized in catastrophic ways. We should continue to focus on responsible AI research and development and implement safeguards against misuse, including monitoring systems, standards for secure AI system development, and agreement on red lines for acceptable use cases.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn34" title="footnote 34"><span>34</span></a><a name="f34"></a>&nbsp;We should be attuned to the impact of GenAI on our economic and political institutions. There's a risk that it concentrates economic and political power in the hands of the very few and could lead to the gains being realized only by a small group, while the rest are left behind.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to emphasize is AI governance. I think most would agree that the goal of the technology is to improve the human condition, and to do that, we need to be intentional in advancing that goal. We should make sure that we think about GenAI as enhancing, not replacing, humans, and set up best practices and cultural norms to that end. Every financial institution should recognize the limitations of the technology, explore where and when GenAI belongs in any process, and identify how humans can be best positioned to be in the loop. We should also focus on data quality, and make sure that uses of GenAI do not perpetuate or amplify biases inherent in the data used to train the system or make incorrect inferences to the extent the data is incomplete or nonrepresentative.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn35" title="footnote 35"><span>35</span></a><a name="f35"></a>&nbsp;In the realm of regulation, frameworks for understanding model risk may need to be updated to address the complexity and challenges of explaining AI methods and the difficulty of assessing data quality.</p>
<p>We need to be attuned to the risk in finance. The very attributes that make GenAI attractive&mdash;the speed, automaticity, and ability to optimize financial strategies&mdash;also present risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn36" title="footnote 36"><span>36</span></a><a name="f36"></a>&nbsp;When the technology becomes ubiquitous, use of GenAI could lead to herding behavior and the concentration of risk, potentially amplifying market volatility. As GenAI agents will be directed to maximize profit, they may converge on strategies to maximize returns through coordinated market manipulation, potentially fueling asset bubbles and crashes. Speed, automaticity, and ubiquity could generate new risks at wide scale.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm#fn37" title="footnote 37"><span>37</span></a><a name="f37"></a></p>
<p>We also should monitor how introduction of this technology changes the banking landscape. Nonbanks may be more nimble and risk-forward in incorporating GenAI into their operations, which may push intermediation to less-regulated, less transparent corners of the financial sector. In addition, this competitive pressure may push all institutions, including regulated institutions, to take a more aggressive approach to GenAI adoption, heightening the governance, alignment, and financial risks I mentioned before.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while AI's impact will vary across industries and the reality is evolving, the scenarios I have outlined today provide a framework to begin thinking about how we should respond to developments in GenAI. However, as I mentioned above, elements of both scenarios will likely be present in the future, and play out at different rates, which will influence the effects on the economy and society. Rapid advances in this technology, such as Agentic AI and advancements in open-source models, underscore just how new this technology is and the importance of understanding what it means for individuals, businesses, and markets. Thank you.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Appropriate Capital Rules Needed For Deep, Liquid Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-appropriate-capital-rules-needed-for-deep-liquid-markets-2025218/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-appropriate-capital-rules-needed-for-deep-liquid-markets-2025218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Basel III capital framework was designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks in response to weaknesses exposed by the global financial crisis. As the last components of the framework are finalized and implemented around the world, it is critical that this quest for stability in the banking sector is balanced with the need to maintain deep and liquid financial markets. If capital requirements are disproportionately punitive, this will compromise the liquidity and smooth functioning of markets, which will negatively affect economic growth.</p>
<p>It has long been clear that the Basel III &lsquo;endgame&rsquo; package of proposed rules, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230727a.htm">US regulators published for consultation in 2023</a>, is inappropriately calibrated and would constrain the capacity of banks to offer vital intermediation and risk management services. If the rules are not comprehensively revised, this would have grave consequences for hundreds of thousands of companies that rely on banks to raise financing for growth and investment. From diminished access to funding to a lack of hedging solutions and increased vulnerability to external shocks, it is companies that will suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why ISDA stands firmly by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">the recommendations we made to US regulators last year</a>, which were based on the results of a quantitative impact assessment. Those recommendations, which include greater recognition of diversification in the market risk framework to reflect actual risk exposure and changes to certain aspects of the rules for credit valuation adjustment and securities financing transactions, would improve the risk sensitivity of the Basel III endgame and avoid negative repercussions for US capital markets.</p>
<p>It is also vital that regulators take a holistic view of how different rules interact with each other. Capital requirements must not be implemented in a vacuum, without due consideration of how they might affect other regulations and market processes.</p>
<p>Central clearing, widely recognized to be a vital risk-reducing activity, is a good example of this. Unfortunately, ISDA&rsquo;s analysis has shown that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/15/capital-for-clearing-must-be-risk-appropriate/">the US Basel III rules and the capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIB) would increase capital for six US G-SIB client clearing businesses by $7.2 billion, which is equivalent to more than 80%</a>. This punitive tax is completely at odds with the post-financial crisis policy objective to promote greater use of central clearing and would negatively affect market stability. We have set out the steps that are necessary to fix this issue and will continue to advocate for those changes so the provision of vital client clearing services is not compromised.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is due to introduce mandatory clearing in the US Treasury market from the end of this year. ISDA has been leveraging its experience in derivatives clearing to help firms prepare for this transformational change, but the prudential framework must also be calibrated appropriately.</p>
<p>As it stands,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/08/08/getting-to-grips-with-treasury-clearing/">the proposed US capital rules don&rsquo;t recognize cross-product netting for transactions based on US Treasury securities and interest rate futures</a>. Services like these allow firms to obtain initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of transactions, reflecting reduced risk, but there is no commensurate benefit from a capital perspective under the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. As more Treasury securities and repos are cleared under the SEC rules, the lack of recognition of cross-product netting will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing.</p>
<p>We also think changes are necessary to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which is inconsistent with the objective to improve the efficiency and resilience of the Treasury market, as we pointed out in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/05/isda-submits-letter-to-us-agencies-on-slr-reform/">letter to prudential regulators last year</a>. The SLR acts as a non-risk-sensitive binding constraint on banks that can impede their ability to act as intermediaries, including their capacity to offer client clearing. We are pleased to hear Federal Reserve chair&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/cpi-report-today-inflation-stock-market-02-12-2025/card/powell-says-easing-bank-capital-requirements-could-help-treasury-market-s2FgvVH2xlHnNChGEb3o">Jerome Powell acknowledge in testimony to the US House Committee on Financial Services last week that changes are necessary</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why regulators can&rsquo;t begin work on the SLR, cross-product netting and the G-SIB surcharge now, even before the Basel III endgame is finalized.</p>
<p>These are complex, challenging issues but the stakes are too high for inaction. With a new administration in the US and fresh faces at some of the key agencies, it is vital that policymakers take the time to correct these calibration issues. Deep and liquid markets, which are critical for economic growth, depend on a risk-appropriate capital framework. We must get this right.</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Leans In On Consumer-Driven Banking Framework - Announces Consultation With The Public And Private Sectors To Explore How To Support Open Banking Among CIRO Members</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is exploring how it can support the adoption of consumer-driven banking, also known as open banking, while reducing burden and duplication.</p>
<p>Consumer-driven banking allows consumers and small businesses to securely share their financial data with approved service providers. Canada&rsquo;s proposed consumer-driven banking framework is designed to provide a secure and efficient way for Canadians to access and share their financial data while enabling new financial tools and services.</p>
<p>CIRO will consult with its Members, and other stakeholders, to clarify accreditation, regulatory oversight, and compliance expectations within the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/financial-sector-policy/open-banking-implementation/budget-2024-canadas-framework-for-consumer-driven-banking.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">federal standards</a>. CIRO&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/7981/download?inline" target="_self" title="CIRO Strategic Plan FY 2025-2027">2025-2027 Strategic Plan</a>&nbsp;identified the need for transformational initiatives to advance the structure of regulation in Canada specifically aimed at enabling innovation, while still maintaining strong consumer protections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of our members have told us that they would like to voluntarily opt into the consumer-driven banking framework. Those who do will need to meet accreditation requirements, follow security standards, and support reciprocal data-sharing,&rdquo; said Karen McGuinness, Senior Vice-President, Finance, Investor and Member Relations at CIRO. &ldquo;By helping support the adoption of consumer-driven banking, CIRO seeks to drive meaningful transformation and the modernization of industry practices, and to foster greater efficiencies for the benefit of Canadian investors and the broader public. We can build a more connected and investor-centric financial ecosystem by embracing innovation and reducing barriers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As appropriate, CIRO intends to coordinate our efforts with other key stakeholders and regulatory agencies, including the Canadian Securities Administrators.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Invite Industry Participation On Data Portability Study As Part Of New Testing Initiative</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-regulators-invite-industry-participation-on-data-portability-2025218/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-regulators-invite-industry-participation-on-data-portability-2025218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Securities regulators in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are inviting industry to engage in discussions &ndash; and potentially participate in testing of tools and strategies &ndash; to foster greater portability of client data in the investment market.</p>
<p>The consultation and potential testing will be conducted under a new Canadian Securities Administrators program called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/collaboratory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;CSA Collaboratory</a>,&rdquo; a mechanism to explore the market impact and regulatory implications of new technologies and business models.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The acceleration of technological change is having profound effects on the investment market,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;As regulators, we need to anticipate those changes. The CSA Collaboratory will allow us to engage more intensively with both established market participants and innovative businesses pioneering new tools and business practices, and hopefully assess those innovations under real-world conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CSA Collaboratory&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/collaboratory/data-portability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first project</a>&nbsp;will consider issues raised by all aspects of data portability, with a focus on data portability and the process of collecting client information using digital means, known as electronic Know-Your-Client (&ldquo;e-KYC&rdquo;) solutions. These issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand for and benefits of data portability solutions;</li>
<li>The use of data portability in mitigating investor risk;</li>
<li>Privacy and security concerns related to increasing data portability;</li>
<li>Technological standards and innovations related to data portability; and</li>
<li>Possible regulatory barriers affecting the development of data portability solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Governments around the world are exploring how to give users greater control over their own data, while also providing safeguards for data privacy,&rdquo; said Brenda Leong, Chair and CEO of the BC Securities Commission, which is championing the data portability project with the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;The CSA wants to better understand how this trend &ndash; and the corresponding technological solutions &ndash; mesh with current securities regulations, and what changes might be necessary to facilitate those innovations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the data portability consultation and focused discussions progress to a test of technological tools or business strategies, eligible businesses would be allowed to simultaneously pilot those innovations in a controlled space, within pre-defined parameters and timeframes. Companies will receive direct feedback from CSA staff throughout the testing process, and the CSA will gain a deeper understanding of companies&rsquo; technological capabilities, goals and challenges.</p>
<p>More details about the consultation stage of the project, including questions for which the CSA is seeking comment, are provided in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/02/6207521-CSA-Multilateral-Discussion-Paper-11-406.ashx">CSA Multilateral Discussion Paper 11-406,&nbsp;<em>CSA Financial Innovation Hub Introduces Collaboratory and Data Portability Test</em></a>, available on CSA members&rsquo; websites. Comments should be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/consultations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted in writing on or before May 19, 2025</a>. Once the CSA has considered the feedback, it will provide an update on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/collaboratory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA Collaboratory&rsquo;s website</a>, which will likely identify topics of focus and a schedule for the discussions. As appropriate, the CSA intends to coordinate its efforts with other key stakeholders and regulatory agencies, including the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO).</p>
<p>The data portability consultation is envisioned as the first of several topics that could be explored through the CSA Collaboratory&rsquo;s cohort-based approach to testing new technologies and innovative business models in capital markets. Each cohort test theme will be led by one or more Canadian securities regulators, with opt-in available for other CSA members to participate. The CSA encourages industry participants and other interested stakeholders to provide suggestions about future topics or trends that can be explored through the CSA Collaboratory on the CSA Collaboratory&rsquo;s webpage.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ICE Bonds Sees Record Trading For Corporate, Municipal And Agency Bonds In 2024 - Demand For Enhanced Sweeps Session-Based Protocol For Corporate Bonds Increases In Fourth Quarter</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced record 2024 trading volume for corporate bonds, municipal bonds and agencies trading on ICE Bonds. ICE Bonds attributes this strong growth to increased usage of its corporate bond sweeps protocol and the expansion of its global liquidity network of traders and portfolio managers.</p>
<p>Trading on ICE Bonds reached record notional volume of $212 billion for corporate bonds in 2024, up 40% from 2023. Municipal bond trading reached record notional volume of $178 billion in 2024, up 5% from 2023, while Agencies, or bonds issued by government-sponsored enterprises or federal agencies, had record notional trading volume of $28 billion in 2024, up 20% from 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The volume growth we are experiencing is primarily driven by increased adoption of our trading protocols by a combination of retail-oriented brokerage firms and institutional investors,&rdquo; said Peter Borstelmann, President of ICE Bonds. &ldquo;Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve made significant progress in expanding our customer network, expanding our execution protocols and workflows, and introducing our unique liquidity to a more diverse set of market participants, which is resulting in record transactional activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE Bonds attributes its strong growth in corporate bond volumes to customer adoption of its enhanced sweeps session-based protocol called Risk Matching Auction (RMA). In the fourth quarter of 2024, RMA volumes increased by 100% from the prior quarter and were up over four-fold since the fourth quarter of 2023. ICE Bonds conducts multiple RMA sessions each week, with 50 registered firms and over 400 users participating.</p>
<p>The ICE Bonds RMA allows traders to efficiently upload their inventory of bonds and our proprietary algorithm then proposes potential matches between buyers and sellers of the same bond or list of bonds. The protocol leverages ICE&rsquo;s Continuous Evaluated Pricing (CEP&trade;) to propose a pricing level for the bonds, which traders can either affirm or reject on a line-item basis or in bulk. We believe that this process gives traders an efficient way to reduce risk exposure as they access a broadening pool of fixed income liquidity.</p>
<p>ICE Bonds offers deep liquidity pools that support multiple trading protocols including click-to-trade, sweeps, auctions and RFQ, with a vast breadth of fixed income data. Focused on execution efficiency, ICE Bonds enables both anonymous and disclosed counterparty interactions, and trading from odd-lots to blocks for Corporates, Municipals, Agencies, Treasuries and Certificates of Deposit.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) are advancing in the implementation of the pan-European oversight framework of critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) with the objective to designate the CTPPs and to start the oversight engagement this year.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>CTPP designation and engagement</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">To designate the CTPPs in 2025, the ESAs will perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Collection of the Registers of Information:</span>&nbsp;Competent Authorities are required to submit to the ESAs, by 30 April 2025, the Registers of Information on ICT third-party arrangements they received from financial entities.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Criticality assessments</span>: The ESAs will perform the criticality assessments mandated by DORA and notify ICT third-party service providers of their classification as critical by July 2025. This notification will start a six-week period during which ICT third-party service providers may object to the assessment with a reasoned statement and relevant supporting information.</li>
<li><span>Final Designation</span>: After the six-week period, the ESAs will designate CTPPs and start oversight engagement with them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">ICT third-party service providers not designated as critical may voluntarily request to be designated as critical once the list of CTPPs is published. Details on how to request this will be provided soon.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Implementation of the oversight framework and setup of the joint ESAs oversight function</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">The ESAs have been preparing the governance, procedures and methodologies necessary to conduct oversight activities.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To maximise synergies, ensure consistency in the oversight tasks and use resources efficiently, the ESAs have set up a joint DORA oversight function, led since October 2024 by a joint Director. The establishment of this function will allow the ESAs to perform their day-to-day oversight duties with an integrated approach across their sectors.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">To provide clarity to the market on preparatory activities, the designation process and on the ESAs&rsquo; oversight approach, the ESAs plan to organise an online workshop with ICT third-party providers in the second quarter of 2025. Further details on the exact date will be published in due course.</p>
<p><img alt="DORA designation timeline" height="489" src="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/DORA_designation_timeline_0.png" width="699" /></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">The EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), along with the oversight framework of CTPPs, entered into application on 17&nbsp;January&nbsp;2025, marking a significant milestone for enhancing the digital operational resilience of the financial sector in the EU.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Mako For Failings Relating To cum-ex trading</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Mako Financial Markets Partnership LLP (Mako) &pound;1,662,700 for failing to ensure it had effective systems and controls to guard against financial crime.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mako also failed to adequately apply the policies and procedures it did have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This eighth enforcement case brought by the FCA, concludes its investigations into cum-ex trading. Working closely with EU and global law enforcement agencies, the FCA has imposed fines of more than &pound;30m in relation to this trading.</p>
<p>Between December 2013 and November 2015, Mako executed purported over-the-counter equity trades on behalf of clients of the Solo Group, worth approximately &pound;68.6bn in Danish equities and &pound;23.6bn in Belgian equities. Mako received commission of approximately &pound;1.45m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trading was circular, which is highly suggestive of financial crime. It appears to have been carried out to allow the arranging of withholding tax (WHT) reclaims in Denmark and Belgium. Several individuals have now been convicted in Denmark as part of this scheme.</p>
<p>Mako additionally failed to identify red flags in other instances related to the Solo Group business. This involved a series of transactions which had no obvious rationale, and which resulted in the Solo Group&rsquo;s controller incurring a &euro;2m loss, to the benefit of his business associates. Mako also received payment from a United Arab Emirates-based third party connected to the Solo Group for outstanding debts owed by the Solo Group&rsquo;s clients without performing any due diligence which created an increased risk of money laundering.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: &lsquo;Mako failed to spot clear red flags and facilitated highly suspicious trading that made it vulnerable to being used to support financial crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For UK financial services to grow and compete, investors need to have trust in it. That&rsquo;s why it is vital we stamp out these unacceptable practices which risk the reputation and integrity of UK markets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As Mako has not disputed the FCA&rsquo;s findings and agreed to settle, it qualified for a 30% discount on its fine under the FCA&rsquo;s settlement discount scheme. &nbsp;</p>

<li>This is the eighth and last enforcement case brought by the FCA in relation to cum-ex trading. The previous 7 FCA cases relating to cum-ex trading include in May 2021 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/sapien-capital-limited-2021.pdf" title="Final Notice 2021: Sapien Capital Ltd">Final Notice: Sapien Capital Ltd</a>; November 2021 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/sunrise-brokers-llp-2021.pdf" title="Final Notice 2021: Sapien Capital Ltd">Final Notice: Sunrise Brokers LLP</a>; July 2022 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/the-tjm-partnership-limited-formerly-known-as-neovision-global-capital-limited-in-liquidation-2022.pdf" title="Final Notice 2022: TJM Partnership Limited">Final Notice: TJM Partnership Limited</a>&nbsp;(in liquidation); June 2023 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/edf-man-capital-markets-ltd-2023.pdf" title="Final Notice 2023: ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets Ltd">Final Notice: ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets Ltd</a>; July 2023 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/bastion-capital-london-ltd-2023.pdf" title="Final Notice 2023: Bastion Capital London Ltd">Final Notice: Bastion Capital London Ltd</a>; September 2023 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/decision-notices/nailesh-manubhai-teraiya-2023.pdf" title="Decision Notice 2023: Nailesh Teraiya">Decision Notice: Nailesh Teraiya</a>; and January 2025 &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/arian-financial-llp-2025.pdf" title="Final Notice 2025: Arian Financial LLP">Final Notice: Arian Financial LLP</a>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Nailesh Teraiya has referred his Decision Notice to the Upper Tribunal. Any findings in his Decision Notice are therefore provisional and reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers his behaviour should be characterised.</li>
<li>The Solo Group consists of 4 previously authorised firms: Solo Capital Partners LLP, West Point Derivatives Ltd, Old Park Lane Capital Ltd and Telesto Markets LLP.</li>
<li>The &lsquo;Solo clients&rsquo; means entities introduced by the Solo Group to Mako and the other broker firms, on some of whose behalf Mako executed purported equity trades during the relevant period.</li>
<li>Cum-ex trading involves trading of shares on or just before the last cum-dividend date. If in a suitable jurisdiction this can then allow a party to claim a tax rebate on withholding tax, sometimes without entitlement.</li>
<li>The intention of dividend arbitrage trading (of which cum-ex is an example) is to place shares in alternative tax jurisdictions around dividend dates, with the aim of minimising withholding tax or generating withholding tax reclaims. This may involve several different trading activities including trading and lending securities and trading derivatives, designed to hedge movements in the price of the securities over the dividend dates.</li>
<li>Withholding tax (WHT) is a levy deducted at source from income and passed to the government by the entity paying it. Many securities pay periodic income in the form of dividends or interest, and local tax regulations often impose a withholding tax on such income. In certain cases where WHT is levied on payment to a foreign entity it may be reclaimed if there is a formal treaty, called a double taxation agreement (DTA), between the country in which the income is paid and the country of residence of the recipient. DTAs allow for a reduction or rebate of the applicable WHT. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA publication of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/newsletters/marketwatch-52.pdf" title="Market Watch 52 (June 2017)">Market Watch 52</a>&nbsp;highlighted various issues and concerns around dividend arbitrage in 2017.

<h4 class="elementToProof"><b><i>Diffusion Cloud for Financial Services<br /></i></b></h4>

A key benefit for financial organisations is more cost-effective development, deployment and maintenance vs an in-house build. Development teams will save weeks of effort and drastically reduce bandwidth consumption.</p>
<h4><b><i>Diffusion Cloud for iGaming<br /></i></b></h4>
<p>iGaming is highly event-driven and demands applications that instantly react to fast-changing market prices before a game&nbsp;(Pre Match), and during the game (In Play). Industry leaders and well-known high-street&nbsp;brands use Diffusion Cloud to eradicate missed bets and provide real-time market lines that keeps them ahead of competitors&nbsp;(In Play, Cash Out, Live Scores, Personalised Offers etc.). Diffusion Cloud handles the large increased spike in users that comes with a major sporting event and delivers data to all the users in real-time &ndash; providing superior customer experiences across&nbsp;all your iGaming offerings be it Sportsbook, Casino, Bingo, and eSports.</p>
<p>iGaming companies use the Diffusion Cloud framework to seed development and shorten go-to-market time for new offerings; control and secure gaming event-data flowing to and from millions of online customers; reduce development and ongoing operational costs; simplify deployment; assure regulatory compliance for geographic expansion; and deliver personalised and enriched individual experiences. All of this is achieved by our clients through Diffusion Cloud today.</p>
<h4><i>Industry Challenges</i></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4><i>Scalability and Reducing CapEx and OpEx Costs</i></h4>
<p>Competition and speed of innovation requires organisations to reduce their development cycles and deploy new technologies, in particular around data transformation. It is critical to keep operational costs under control. To reduce costs there is a need for a proven and performant framework which can reduce operational complexity and cost, manage increased scale of real-time data delivery to meet market demands, and assure data access control and security. The key to success is deploying a framework, i.e. Diffusion Cloud, that can easily and reliably scale up and down as required and deliver data with optimal efficiency using patented data optimisation and compression algorithms to reduce bandwidth costs by up to 90%.</p>
<h4><b><i>Connecting, Transforming and Delivering Real-Time Data<br /></i></b></h4>
<p>Technology providers are looking to introduce solutions which reduce bandwidth and infrastructure requirements for customers to enable lower day-to-day operational costs, less system stress during peak events, and reduced support costs. The reality is that legacy technologies are not smart and send too much data to too many people unnecessarily, which is inefficient and expensive. Peak events will frequently cause massive loads on infrastructure, increase bandwidth needs and result in bottlenecks that affect the business&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>Streaming technologies need to be aware of how data is being used to minimise bandwidth requirements. In order to manage and transmit only the data that has changed, the framework must have the capability to know what has been sent, when it was sent, and to whom it was sent. Such features allow companies to enhance their applications and expand revenue opportunities. Diffusion Cloud addresses the demanding needs of vendors when handling scale, performance, regulatory requirements, disparate geographies, and infrastructure efficiency, are vital to business success.</p>
<h4><b><i>Personalisation<br /></i></b></h4>
<p>One of the key differentiators for many companies is to offer a personalised user experience. There is a business need to anticipate customer desire based on their actions. Responding to customers in a personalised manner can move the goal posts away from churn and towards customer retention and increased engagement and revenue per customer. When a customer engages through online applications, it is critical that they can easily choose options which address their specific requirements. To achieve this goal, one needs to be able to connect to a variety of data sources. In the past, this has meant engaging in an expensive and time-consuming data integration proje</p>
<p>Diffusion Cloud allows our customers to meet these goals without the integration burden. Diffusion is purpose-built to oversee the unique, real-time data ingestion, processing, and delivery challenges among data sources, applications, users, and devices for companies.</p>
<p>Grethe Brown, CEO&nbsp;at DiffusionData, said: &ldquo;Diffusion Cloud removes many of the obstacles developers face when using open source or in-house built solutions, most notably in terms of scalability and latency. By providing developers and architects with a free month&rsquo;s t</p>
<h4><b><i>In summary &ndash; Diffusion Cloud<br /></i></b></h4>
<p>Diffusion Cloud is a pub/sub cache server based on web socket technologies, letting clients keep a connection open and get notified of state changes instead of polling for updates. Diffusion Cloud minimises traffic flow with minimal latency and enables end-to-end data flow, securely, and at scale.</p>
<h4>Diffusion Cloud enables:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Efficient, real-time messaging</b>: Optimised to stream a high rate of messages to many connected clients;</li>
<li><b>Optimised distribution</b>: Understands your data and can automatically remove out-of-date or redundant data; and</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>Tehran Securities Exchange (TSE) published its sustainability report 2024 and invited its listed issuers to proceed with this initiative and the global trends.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sustainability has become one of the fundamental pillars of the economic activities and investment communities. A sustainability report is a document that organizations and companies prepare to clarify their performance in the areas of their economic, social, environmental and corporate governance. The sustainability report provides a clearer picture regarding companies' commitment to sustainable development to their stakeholders, including investors and shareholders&rdquo;, TSE wrote in a letter to the executives of its listed companies.</p>
<p>The invitation maintained that publishing the sustainability report demonstrates corporates&rsquo; responsibility towards society and the environment and allows them to gain public trust and create sustainable value in the long term by increasing transparency.</p>
<p>The publication of the first sustainability report by the Tehran Stock Exchange is an important step towards strengthening this philosophy in Iran&rsquo;s capital market and provides a model for other entities and corporate participants. We expect that issuers listed on Tehran Securities Exchange will make the required arrangements to prepare and publish their sustainability reports (voluntarily at this level) in order to strengthen the process of transparency and accountability, and to demonstrate their commitments to creating a sustainable future for their investors and the entire society.</p>

<p>ASIC is proposing additional relief to further assist Australian financial services and credit licensees comply with the reportable situations regime.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s proposed additional relief aims to reduce the reporting burden on industry while still ensuring that ASIC receives reports of high regulatory value.</p>
<p>We are inviting feedback on our proposal to give relief from reporting certain breaches of the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions, and certain contraventions of civil penalties where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the breach has been rectified within 30 days from when it first occurred (this includes paying any necessary remediation), and</li>
<li>the number of impacted consumers is not more than five, and</li>
<li>the total financial loss or damage to all impacted consumers resulting from the breach is not more than $500 (including where the loss has been remediated), and</li>
<li>the breach is not a contravention of the client money reporting rules, and clearing and settlement rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Licensees are required to have systems and processes in place to identify, escalate, investigate, rectify and capture incidents and breaches as part of their general obligations.</p>

<title>Disinflation Progress Uneven But Still On Track Rates Cuts On Track As Well, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller, At The University Of New South Wales Macroeconomic Workshop, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Bruce, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. It's great being back in Sydney and seeing old friends&mdash;like the Opera House!</p>
<p>As I look at the U.S. economy today, I see that the real side is doing just fine but progress on lowering inflation has come in fits and starts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250217a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;After two good months of inflation data for November and December, January once again disappointed and showed that progress on inflation remains uneven. I continue to believe that the current setting of monetary policy is restricting economic activity somewhat and putting downward pressure on inflation. If this winter-time lull in progress is temporary, as it was last year, then further policy easing will be appropriate. But until that is clear, I favor holding the policy rate steady.</p>
<p>Spending by households and businesses has proved to be resilient, we have solid growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) and the latest data on employment, including revisions to most of 2024, support the view that labor market is in a sweet spot. Meanwhile, last week's January inflation data have a similar feel to that of January 2024, albeit to a smaller degree; they surprised on the high side and raised concerns that the progress we made in pushing inflation toward our 2 percent goal would stall out. But once we got past the first quarter of last year, we did see continued progress in reducing inflation in the latter part of the year. The question now is if we will see progress again later this year, as we did in 2024.</p>
<p>Progress on inflation is an important consideration in policymakers' judgment about whether monetary policy needs adjustment in the near term. The continued solid labor market is one reason why I supported the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision at the end of January to hold our policy rate steady. After two good inflation reports for November and December there was concern about a January bounce back in inflation. So based on good labor market data and concerns about a seasonal shock to inflation not fully adjusted in the data, I felt it was prudent to stand pat at our January meeting. Given last week's inflation report, that concern was warranted.</p>
<p>Let me pause here for a moment to address some commentary after the FOMC meeting that cited uncertainty about the new Administration's policies as a leading reason for that decision. We must keep in mind that there is always a degree of uncertainty about economic policy, and we need to act based on incoming data even when facing great uncertainty about the economic landscape. We have done this in the past and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>Let me provide two recent examples where the FOMC acted in the face of great uncertainty. In March 2022, inflation was roaring, and rate hikes were on the table. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, which created tremendous economic uncertainty around the globe. Not only did the FOMC raise the policy rate in March 2022 for the first time since 2019, but in subsequent meetings we also implemented large rate hikes for several meetings. We could not wait for uncertainty about the war to be resolved.</p>
<p>The second episode was in March of 2023 when stresses emerged in the U.S. banking system, stemming in part from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, with the latter occurring the weekend before our March FOMC meeting. There was great uncertainty as to whether these events would lead to financial instability and a significant contraction of credit that could trigger a recession. Many forecasters projected a recession would hit in the second half of 2023 as a result. Consequently, there were calls to stop hiking the policy rate due to a tremendous amount of financial and banking uncertainty. But the Federal Reserve worked in concert with other government agencies and used its financial stabilization tools to deal with the banking issues and continued raising the policy rate to deal with inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250217a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;So the moral of this story is that monetary policy cannot be put on hold waiting for these types of uncertainty to resolve.</p>
<p>Putting uncertainty aside, let me turn to my view of the economic data. As I noted, real GDP continued to grow solidly in the fourth quarter, at a pace of 2.3 percent, and would have been nearly 1 percentage point stronger without a reduction in inventories, which tend to be volatile. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which are typically two-thirds of GDP, grew a robust 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter. As was noted in the Fed's latest&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>&nbsp;to Congress, households have a solid level of liquid assets to sustain their spending. Based on the limited data we have for the first quarter of 2025 this solid growth seems to be continuing. The employment report for January, which I will focus on in a moment, indicated a continued strong labor market, which should support consumption. Retail sales are reported to have fallen back in January after a strong rise in December, but given how volatile these data can be, and given that the cold weather in January probably held down sales, I'm not putting much weight on that reading for the time being. Business sentiment, as reflected in surveys of purchasing managers in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing, was among the most consistently positive in a while. The index for manufacturing businesses was 50.9, the first time since October 2022 that these results topped 50, as sentiment indicators about orders, production, and employment were all expanding. The corresponding index for the large majority of businesses outside manufacturing also indicated expansion, as it has for some time. The Blue Chip consensus of private forecasters and the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now forecast based on the data in hand predict growth this quarter similar to that of the end of last year. To circle back to my message earlier, many people predicted that tariffs proposed by the Administration on February 1 would have a significant effect on trade and consumption in the first quarter, not to mention prices, but after the postponement of some of those tariffs, it is unclear to me if and when that might show up in the data. I will, of course, be watching closely, but I haven't altered my outlook based on what has been implemented to date.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, data on the labor market indicate that it is in a good spot, with employers having an easier time filling jobs than earlier in the expansion but with still ample demand for new workers and new jobs being created. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4 percent, which is just about where it has been for the past year. Employers added a net 143,000 jobs in January, down some from a 204,000 average for the final three months of 2024 but right around the 133,000 average for the quarter before that. Two factors that may have held down this number a bit were cold weather and the fires in Los Angeles, which prevented thousands of people from getting to or performing their jobs. Beyond payrolls, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people stands at 1.1, close to the level before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Wage growth continues to be strong, and it has considerably outpaced price increases, but is down from two years ago, and for a few reasons, I don't judge recent data as indicating that wages are a factor preventing inflation from making continued progress toward 2 percent. Though the January reading of average hourly earnings was a bit elevated, this series is pretty volatile and the reading may have been held up by weather-related issues. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations, we see wage growth fairly steady at 4 percent a month over the past year. Broader measures of worker compensation show a more distinct moderation in growth. The Labor Department's employment cost index has fallen gradually but consistently from 4.2 percent at the end of 2023 to 3.8 percent at its last reading.</p>
<p>As for whether 4 percent wage growth is consistent with 2 percent inflation, I will note, as I have before, that productivity has grown at roughly a 2 percent annual rate since the advent of the pandemic&mdash;and slightly faster than that in 2023 and 2024. Unless that productivity trend changes a lot, wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Turning to inflation, last week's data taken as a whole were mildly disappointing but not nearly so disappointing as a focus on the consumer price index (CPI) alone would have indicated. Total CPI inflation for January came in hot at 0.5 percent, and core was 0.4 percent, which brings the 12-month changes to 3.0 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. These 12-month readings are lower than we had in January 2024, so we have made some progress over the past year, but they are still too high.</p>
<p>However, we also received producer price data last week, and, combining that information with the CPI data, forecasts for January PCE inflation aren't as alarming as the CPI inflation data. Estimates for total PCE inflation, the FOMC's preferred measure, are about 0.3 percent and that for core PCE inflation was around 0.25 percent. These numbers will mean a bump-up in the monthly pace of core inflation of about one-tenth of 1 percentage point from readings of under 0.2 percent in November and December. And this would leave the 12-month and 6-month average core PCE inflation around 2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. These rates are lower than where they stood in January 2024, which is good, but progress has been slower than I expected on reducing inflation to our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>As a policymaker, I rely on these data to help me judge how close we are to meeting our inflation target. And I'm thinking hard about how to interpret these recent numbers because there seems to be some pattern over the past few years of higher inflation readings at the start of the year. This pattern brings into question whether the inflation data have "residual seasonality," which means that statisticians have not fully corrected for some apparent seasonal fluctuations in some prices. Many firms reset their prices at the beginning of each year, and the Commerce Department tries to factor this in, but even after this adjustment, there is a consensus among economists that some seasonality remains. Incidentally, this probably isn't just a problem in January. Some recently updated research by the Fed staff shows that inflation in the first months of the year has been higher than in the second half for 16 of the last 22 years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250217a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I'm alert to this issue and will watch the data over the next few months to evaluate if we are having what looks like a repeat of high first quarter inflation data that could be followed by lower readings later in the year.</p>
<p>Before I get to my outlook for monetary policy, I want to address a topic of some debate recently, which is the divergence between long-term interest rates and the FOMC's policy rate since we started cutting rates in September. While the FOMC has reduced the policy rate 100 basis points since then, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury security have increased by a noticeable amount. In theory, longer-term rates should follow the expected path of the overnight policy rate set by the FOMC. But this relationship is based on the classic economic assumption of ceteris paribus, or "all other factors remaining constant." The 10-year Treasury security trades in a deep, liquid global market, and its yield is affected by a variety of factors other than the path of the policy rate. This means that all other factors are not constant and that the 10-year Treasury yield may not follow the federal funds rate.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous example of the divergence of market interest rates and policy rates began in the mid 2000's. The FOMC was tightening monetary policy from 2004 to 2006 and raised the policy rate 425 basis points. Over that time, Treasury yields barely moved. This was so surprising that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan referred to it as a "conundrum." At about the same time, future Chair Ben Bernanke identified what he called a "global savings glut" that was pushing up foreign demand for Treasury securities and putting downward pressure on yields. Over time, this has come to be seen as a significant factor for the conundrum then and as a factor for low Treasury yields subsequently. This example is just to illustrate that the 10-year Treasury yield may not respond to the policy rate as expected because of a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the FOMC.</p>
<p>So, what does my economic outlook mean for monetary policy? The labor market is balanced and remarkably resilient. If you want an example of a stable labor market with employment at its maximum level, it looks a lot like where we are right now. On the other side of the FOMC's mandate, inflation is still meaningfully above our target, and progress has been excruciatingly slow over the last year. This tells me that we should currently have a restrictive setting of policy, as we do&mdash;to continue to move inflation down to our goal&mdash;but that setting should be getting closer to neutral as inflation moves closer to 2 percent and should allow the labor market to remain in a good place.</p>
<p>So for now, I believe a pause in rate cuts is appropriate. Assuming the labor market continues to be in rough balance, I can wait and see if the higher inflation readings in January moderate, as they have in the past couple of years. If so, I'll have to decide if this reflects residual seasonality that will go away later in the year and if the underlying trend in inflation is toward 2 percent, or if there is a different issue holding up inflation and how that may play out. Whichever case it may be, the data are not supporting a reduction in the policy rate at this time. But if 2025 plays out like 2024, rate cuts would be appropriate at some point this year.</p>
<p>And while we are waiting on data to understand how the economy is moving relative to our objectives, we will learn more about Administration policies. My baseline view is that any imposition of tariffs will only modestly increase prices and in a non-persistent manner. So I favor looking through these effects when setting monetary policy to the best of our ability. Of course, I concede that the effects of tariffs could be larger than I anticipate, depending on how large they are and how they are implemented. But we also need to remember that it is possible that other policies under discussion could have positive supply effects and put downward pressure on inflation. At the end of the day, the data should be guiding our policy action&mdash;not speculation about what could happen. And if the incoming data supports further rate cuts or staying on pause, then we should do so regardless of how much clarity we have on what policies the Administration adopts. Waiting for economic uncertainty to dissipate is a recipe for policy paralysis.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Almaty hosted an international conference organized by Kazakhstan Stock Exchange JSC (KASE) dedicated to the Exchange joining the international trading platform Tabadul Hub. KASE is the the sixth stock market to join Tabadul.</p>
<p>In August 2024, KASE and KASE Clearing Center JSC (KACC) officially signed an agreement on their work in the Tabadul Digital Exchange Hub. Tabadul was launched by ADX in July 2022 as the region's first digital exchange operating on a mutual market access model. The platform creates a digital network of exchanges that allows investors to trade securities on international markets with remote access for brokerage firms partnering with the exchanges. Tabadul allows investors to access access shares of companies in various sectors including banking, finance, energy and telecommunications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cooperation opens up new opportunities for cross-exchange trading between participants and strengthens the strategic partnership between the two exchanges. In addition, KASE joining Tabadul Hub will optimize trading processes and enhance investment opportunities for market participants by providing access to over 490 listed securities traded on both exchanges for duty-free cross-exchange trading.</p>
<p>In 2024, four new exchanges joined the Tabadul digital exchange platform, significantly expanding ADX&rsquo;s global footprint. The platform now connects eight exchanges, providing ADX investors access to 490 listed companies and a network of over 7.6 million investors. With a combined market capitalization of nearly USD 1 trillion, Tabadul has become a key driver of cross-border investment opportunities. Trading values on the platform reached approximately USD 200 million in 2024, representing a remarkable 317% growth compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Tabadul represents an important step towards building a sustainable economy in the region and beyond, offering investors a wide range of trading opportunities across all member exchanges. The platform is available to all investors registered with local brokers who meet the requirements of the exchanges. Brokers also gain access to IPOs on all participating exchanges.</p>
<p>"KASE's joining Tabadul Hub expands investment opportunities for participants of Kazakhstan's financial market. Operating in Tabadul Hub will increase liquidity and attract more foreign investors, both private and institutional, to Kazakhstan. Kazakh investors can now trade foreign securities on exchanges connected to Tabadul Hub, including Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), Bahrain Bourse (BHB) and Muscat Stock Exchange (MSX). The connectivity of other international exchanges is ongoing. Now it is possible to settle transactions through KACC in Kazakhstani tenge," said <b>Alina Aldambergen, Chairman of the Board of KASE.</b></p>
<p><b>Abdulla Salem Alnuaimi, Group Chief Executive Officer of ADX</b>, stated "We are pleased to officially welcome Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) to the Tabadul digital exchange platform, marking a key milestone in expanding cross-border investment opportunities. With KASE now on Tabadul, ADX investors gain broader international market access at no additional cost. This reflects our commitment to fostering innovation and strategic partnerships to build a globally connected financial ecosystem. The rise in Tabadul trade volumes in 2024 is a testament to the success of these efforts."</p>
<p>Joining Tabadul Hub opens new horizons for Kazakhstani investors, allowing them to increase access to financial instruments and improve the efficiency of international operations.</p>

<title>ACER Suggests Better Reflecting The Benefits Of Europe’s Internal Electricity Market In Poland’s National Resource Adequacy Assessment</title>

This is the second ACER Opinion on a National Resource Adequacy Assessment (NRAA).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a resource adequacy assessment?</span></p>
<p>The European Resource Adequacy Assessment (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUAw4CBVYBB0xfAlVTHVYPVg8dUAsIAhpTVwMFVgMEDgRTD1UdUwAHAghXBwYdVwEGBR0GCFJQGgxVB1UZUVNRVARTAVVQXVQHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ERAA</a>) evaluates electricity resource adequacy across the EU and provides an objective framework to assess the need for additional national measures to ensure security of supply. ERAA is carried out annually by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and reviewed by ACER.</p>
<p>Member States can complement the European analysis with their own national assessments (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPVwRUVwVdAkwMAFBQHVYOVw8dC1tXBxoBUlVWBQoGAABUAAMdUwAHAghXBwYdVwEGBR0GCFJQGgxVB1UZUVNRVARTAVVQXVQHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NRAAs</a>). While the latter follow the ERAA methodology, they may capture new developments or national specificities that have not been reflected in the latest ERAA.</p>
<p>When a national assessment identifies new adequacy concerns, and the Member State informs ACER, ACER must issue an Opinion on the differences between the national and European assessments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s findings?</span></p>
<p>In its Opinion, ACER identified three main differences between the Polish NRAA and ERAA<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>ACER finds that Poland&rsquo;s assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updates assumptions on capacity resources</strong>, for example, by using revised estimates for nuclear and renewable energy capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Introduces additional modelling elements</strong>, e.g. thoroughly assessing the economics of capacity resources by analysing their revenues and costs. However, it does not fully account for the development of demand response and battery storage in the Polish market.</li>
<li><strong>Does not adequately consider the interconnected nature of Europe&rsquo;s electricity market</strong>, as: 
<ul>
<li>the country&rsquo;s maximum import capacity indicated in the NRAA is more constrained than in practice; and</li>
<li>exports are not considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This simplification does not highlight the benefits of cross-border electricity exchanges, which help reduce overall system costs and improve adequacy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER recommends that the Polish Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Polish TSO take these findings into account and, if necessary, revise the NRAA.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUAFVUUQNQBUxfAVIGHVYOV1MdUFwGAxoBV1BSDVADUQ5SV1MdUwAHAghXBwYdVwEGBR0GCFJQGgxVB1UZUVNRVARTAVVQXVQHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you here in Phoenix at the ABA's Conference for Community Bankers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;For the past seven years, this conference provided an excellent forum for me and bankers to meet and interact with a range of state and federal regulators, policymakers, service providers, and other stakeholders. Today I would like to share a brief update on my views on monetary policy and the economy, before I turn to bank regulatory issues, and describe how I think that regulators should approach the important work of "maintenance" of the regulatory framework.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy</strong><br />Toward the end of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began the process of moving the target range for the federal funds rate to a more neutral setting to reflect the progress made since 2023 on lowering inflation and cooling the labor market. At our September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range, for the first time since we began tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, by 50 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent.</p>
<p>You may remember that I dissented from that decision, the first time a Fed Governor dissented from an FOMC rate decision in nearly 20 years. I preferred a smaller initial cut to begin the policy recalibration phase. I explained my reasoning in a statement published after the meeting noting that the strong economy and a healthy labor market did not warrant a larger cut. In addition, moving the policy rate down too quickly could unnecessarily risk stoking demand, potentially reigniting inflationary pressures, and could be interpreted as a premature "declaration of victory" on our price-stability mandate.</p>
<p>At the most recent FOMC meeting last month, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this action because, after recalibrating the policy rate by 100 basis points through the December meeting, I think that policy is now in a good place, allowing the Committee to be patient and pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves.</p>
<p>In my view, the current policy stance also provides the opportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get further clarity on the administration's policies and their effects on the economy. It will be very important to have a better sense of these policies, how they will be implemented, and establish greater confidence about how the economy will respond in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>For now, the U.S. economy remains strong, with solid growth in economic activity and a labor market near full employment. Core inflation is still somewhat elevated, but has appeared to resume its downward path, and my baseline expectation has been that it will moderate further this year. Even with this outlook, there are upside risks to my baseline expectation for the inflation path.</p>
<p>In 2023, the rate of inflation declined significantly, but it has taken longer to see further meaningful declines since that time. The latest consumer and producer price index reports suggest that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures inflation&mdash;which excludes food and energy prices&mdash;likely moved down to around 2.6 percent in January, which would represent a noticeable stepdown from its 2.8 percent reading in December and 3.0 percent at the end of 2023. Progress had been especially slow and uneven since the spring of last year mostly due to rising core goods price inflation.</p>
<p>After increasing at a solid pace, on average, over the first nine months of last year, gross domestic product appears to have risen a bit more moderately in the fourth quarter, reflecting a large drop in the volatile category of inventory investment. In contrast, private domestic final purchases, which provide a better signal about underlying growth in economic activity, maintained its strong momentum from earlier in the year, as personal consumption rose robustly again in the fourth quarter. Following strong readings in December, retail sales and sales of motor vehicles softened in January. However, these data can be noisy around this time of the year and sales were likely affected by the cold and wintery weather last month.</p>
<p>Payroll employment gains have picked up since the summer of last year and averaged a strong pace of about 240,000 per month over the past three months, with last month's gains likely held back by the Los Angeles wildfires and the harsh winter weather. The unemployment rate edged down further to 4.0 percent in January and has moved sideways since the middle of last year, remaining below my estimate of full employment.</p>
<p>The labor market appears to have stabilized in the second half of last year, after it loosened from extremely tight conditions. The rise in the unemployment rate since mid-2023 largely reflects weaker hiring, as job seekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while layoffs have remained low. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has remained close to the pre-pandemic level in recent months, and there are still more available jobs than available workers. The labor market no longer appears to be especially tight, but wage growth remains somewhat above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.</p>
<p>The recent revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor data further vindicates my view that the labor market was not weakening in a concerning way during the summer of last year. Although payroll employment gains were revised down considerably in the 12 months through March 2024, job gains were little revised, on net, over the remainder of last year. It is crucial that U.S. official data more accurately capture structural changes in labor markets in real time, so we can confidently rely on these data for monetary and economic policymaking. But in the meantime, given conflicting economic signals, measurement challenges, and significant data revisions in recent years, I remain cautious about taking signal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.</p>
<p>Assuming the economy evolves as I expect, I think that inflation will slow further this year. As the inflation data since the spring of last year show, its progress may be bumpy and uneven, and progress on disinflation may take longer than we would hope. I continue to see greater risks to price stability, especially while the labor market remains strong.</p>
<p>With encouraging signs that geopolitical tensions may be abating in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and in Asia, I will be monitoring global supply chains which could continue to be susceptible to disruptions, and lead to inflationary effects on food, energy, and other commodity markets. In addition, the release of pent-up demand following the election could lead to stronger economic activity, which could also influence inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Having entered a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more neutral policy stance, there are a few considerations that lead me to prefer a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting policy, as it provides us time to assess progress in achieving our inflation and employment goals.</p>
<p>Given the current policy stance, I think that easier financial conditions from higher equity prices over the past year may have slowed progress on disinflation. And I am watching the increase in longer-term Treasury yields that has occurred since the start of policy recalibration at the September meeting. Some have interpreted it as a reflection of investors' concerns about inflation risks and the possibility of tighter-than-expected policy that may be required to address inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>There is still more work to be done to bring inflation closer to our 2 percent goal. I would like to gain greater confidence that progress in lowering inflation will continue as we consider making further adjustments to the target range. We need to keep inflation in focus while the labor market appears to be in balance and the unemployment rate remains at historically low levels. Before our March meeting, we will have received one additional month of inflation and employment data.</p>
<p>Looking forward, it is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to help me interpret the signals provided by real-time data and as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>Bringing inflation in line with our price stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance of the Regulatory Framework</strong><br />I will now turn to bank supervision, the bank applications process, and regulation. Community banks experience the burden of the regulatory framework most acutely when it is not appropriately tailored to their size, risk, complexity, and business model. While promoting safety and soundness in the banking system&mdash;particularly among community banks&mdash;is an important and necessary regulatory objective, we must also be cautious to ensure that the framework does not become an impediment to their operations, preventing them from providing competitive products and services, innovating, and engaging in appropriate risk-taking.</p>
<p>During my tenure at the Board, I have laid out a wide range of issues and concerns that I see as critical components that are necessary to build and maintain an effective regulatory framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;While I will only address a subset of these issues today, I'd like to begin by clarifying what I mean by this.</p>
<p>Our work to maintain an effective framework is never really complete. Just as complacency can be fatal to the business of a bank, complacency can also prevent regulators from meeting their statutory obligation to promote a safe and sound banking system that enables banks to serve their customers effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>System maintenance is not something that we should shy away from. In our everyday lives, we invest significant time in maintenance. We schedule regular oil changes for our cars, and we invest in the infrastructure that allows our economy to function. Devoting resources to maintenance often prevents more costly issues down the road&mdash;it's easier to get oil changes than it is to rebuild an engine.</p>
<p>So, what does maintenance look like in practice? To address this question, I think it's helpful to look at three core areas in the bank regulatory framework: Supervision, Bank applications, and Regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Approach to Supervision</strong><br />Let's start with supervision. Supervision operates almost entirely outside of the public view. Much of the work involves the review of proprietary business information from banks, and the preparation of examination reports shielded from public scrutiny under the auspices of protecting confidential supervisory information. But confidentiality should not be used to prevent scrutiny and accountability in the assignment of ratings.</p>
<p>So, today, I am going to dig a bit deeper into the realm of supervision to discuss supervisory ratings, accountability, and the troubling trend of inaction and opacity within the supervisory toolkit.</p>
<p><em>Rational Standards &amp; Ratings</em><br />While there is some public disclosure of supervisory information, it is often difficult to get a true understanding of supervision based on data that may be released. In fact, this data often sends confusing and conflicting signals. For example, the Board's Supervision and Regulation Report presented information stating that only one-third of large financial institutions maintained satisfactory ratings across all relevant ratings components in the first half of 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;At the same time, this report noted that most large financial institutions met supervisory expectations with respect to capital and liquidity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>The odd mismatch between financial condition and overall supervisory condition as assessed by the prudential regulators raises a more significant issue, whether subjective examiner judgment&mdash;those evaluations based on subjective, examiner-driven, non-financial concerns&mdash;is driving the firm's overall rating. Are ratings trends based on the materiality of the identified issues, or do they imply that the regulators see widespread fragility in the banking system?</p>
<p>While this example highlights a large bank ratings framework issue, it is symptomatic of a broader issue that warrants scrutiny&mdash;whether the approach to supervision has led to a world in which core financial risks have been de-prioritized, and non-core and non-financial risks&mdash;things like IT, operational risk, management, risk management, internal controls, and governance&mdash;have been over-emphasized. These issues are important, and certainly worthwhile topics for examiners to consider, but their review should not come at the expense of more material financial risk considerations&mdash;and they should not drive the overall assessment of a firm's condition. There is evidence that supervision has undergone such a shift, not only among large banks, but among regional and community banks as well.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;For all institutions, financial metrics are not among the primary findings determined from the examination process, and arguably they have been de-emphasized when assigning supervisory ratings.</p>
<p>Prioritization is valuable in the supervisory process, both to inform how examiners allocate their time, but also in helping banks allocate resources to remediate issues identified during the supervisory process. The frequency of supervisory findings related to non-financial metrics may be a byproduct of how long it takes to remediate these issues, like longstanding issues with IT systems that have not been enhanced over many years of growth. However, we should also be vigilant and deliberate about any shift in supervisory focus from financial risk toward non-financial risks and internal processes, as this shift is not focused on fundamental safety and soundness issues and it is not cost-free.</p>
<p>We should also not expect every firm to coalesce around a single set of products, internal processes, and risk-management practices. Variety in banking models is a strength and a necessity of the U.S. banking system, relying on management and boards of directors to determine bank strategy, rather than a bank's business model effectively being set by supervisory directives.</p>
<p>Supervisory practices like horizontal reviews can create examiner incentives to expect uniformity and "grade on a curve," but this approach perversely punishes variation among bank practices, stifling competition and innovation. Supervisory findings also inform bank ratings, which can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A); raising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank management priorities.</p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Accountability</em><br />To maintain strong and appropriate supervisory standards and practices, we need to take a step back and diagnose the bank regulatory system in its entirety: what is working, what is broken, and what needs to be updated. When things go wrong, having an impartial check on subjective judgments can lead to a better diagnosis. Of course, a better diagnosis can produce more efficient and targeted improvements, and better promote accountability. Accountability is critical to maintaining an effective regulatory system, and yet it can be difficult to establish a regulatory culture that includes mechanisms to promote accountability for supervisors and regulators.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>At every organizational level, from examiners to agency leadership, judgments are made that contribute to the overall effectiveness of the supervisory process. Reserve Bank examiners play a critical role in examining Fed-regulated institutions, both banks and holding companies. The Federal Reserve exercises its supervisory responsibilities by supervisory portfolio, with each portfolio relying on a combination of Board and Reserve Bank staff.<a name="f7"></a><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;But this split allocation of responsibility should not diminish the accountability for supervisory decision making. Responsibility for supervisory decisions must be coupled with accountability for these decisions. The misalignment of responsibility and accountability limits our ability to conduct effective supervision.</p>
<p>This division of responsibility can pose a challenge to accountability. In the aftermath of the bank failures in 2023 and the broader stress to the banking system, the Board and other agencies proposed a variety of regulatory reform measures to remediate and address identified issues, based on internal reviews of the failures and banking stress. While I applaud efforts to hold ourselves accountable, we must ensure that self-reviews are credible, both in the causes they identify and in the reform agenda that they are used to support. An internal review process poses the temptation to avoid responsibility by assigning blame elsewhere, even when the review may be motivated by good intentions and with the outward appearance of impartiality.</p>
<p>Many of the core problems in the lead-up to the bank failures involved well-known, core banking risks&mdash;interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and poor risk management. But if we look at the subsequent reform agenda, we see that the policy emphasis has been on broader regulatory changes rather than addressing supervisory program deficiencies. In my mind, this highlights the need to have a process that challenges the subjective judgments of those that were involved in oversight, not only in performing the diagnostics, but evaluating how identified issues can best be remediated.</p>
<p><em>Purging Inaction and Opacity from the Supervisory Toolkit</em><br />Supervision differs significantly from the regulatory process. Implementing new regulations, or amending existing ones, requires a public notice and comment process established by the Administrative Procedure Act. When done appropriately, regulations require regulators to "show their work" by providing extensive analytical and factual support for proposals and final rules and soliciting comment from the public and addressing those comments before finalizing a regulation. In contrast, the execution of bank examinations and the issuance of supervisory guidance lack these procedural safeguards, instead relying heavily on discretion and judgment with far lower standards for justifying actions taken with factual and analytical support under the veil of confidential supervisory information. The greater flexibility afforded in the supervisory process can lead to poor outcomes, often caused by the temptation to use inaction and opacity as supervisory tools. In my view, these tools, inaction and opacity, are not appropriate and must be subject to appropriate scrutiny or purged from the toolkit altogether.</p>
<p>First let's consider inaction. The exam process requires open communication between examiners and banks. Often interpretive questions arise during the exam process; how do existing rules and statutes apply in a particular circumstance? These questions arise when existing rules and guidance are unclear, which is a frequent occurrence. For example, how can a bank operate in a safe and sound manner while offering a new product or service, or when serving customers in particular business lines with unique needs? Banks go to great effort to meet all applicable requirements and regulatory expectations, and regulators should welcome banks seeking supervisory input and relying on a compliance-focused mindset.</p>
<p>Open communication with regulated banks is a hallmark of good supervision, but regulators must live up to their end of the bargain by not leaving banks in "limbo" for extended periods of time. When a bank requests feedback and engages in good faith to provide information and respond to reasonable questions, regulators have an obligation to provide a clear response. Banks should not be left to wonder whether an interpretation of existing laws, regulations, and guidance is consistent with the understanding of regulators.</p>
<p>Next, let's consider opacity. Questions raised in the supervisory channel often result from supervisory expectations that lack sufficient clarity or the application of rules and regulations to new and emerging products and services. While regulators should not form an opinion without understanding the relevant facts and circumstances, they must also strive to provide clarity&mdash;not just to the bank being examined, but to all banks. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms, and yet transparency around expectations is often challenging to achieve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The problem of opacity in supervisory expectations is exacerbated by the umbrella of confidential supervisory information, or CSI, which is the label given to most materials developed in the examination process. The rules designed to protect CSI limit the public's visibility into shifting priorities and expectations in the supervisory process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Changes in supervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or published rulemaking. In the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory opacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management and operations of affected banks.</p>
<p>Opacity in supervisory expectations, or in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, should not be discovered only at the conclusion of an examination with the issuance of deficiencies, matters requiring attention, matters requiring immediate attention, or other shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>Approach to Applications</strong><br />Sunshine is the best disinfectant when it comes to an approach that fosters transparency and accountability. So, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing how we can better shine a light into the dark corners of the bank applications process.</p>
<p><em>De Novo Formation</em><br />De novo formation has essentially stagnated over the past several years. While many factors have contributed to the decline in the aggregate number of banks in the United States, one key factor has been the lack of new bank formation to replace banks that have been acquired or closed their doors. This lack of de novo bank approvals does not necessarily indicate a lack of demand for new charters though, particularly in light of ongoing demand for bank "charter strip" acquisitions where banks have been acquired just for their charters, the growing demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships, and the shift of activities outside of the banking sector into the non-bank financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250217a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;We should consider whether the applications process itself has become an unnecessary impediment to de novo formation.</p>
<p>How can we improve the process of de novo formation? As fewer applications come in, institutional muscle memory for how to deal with new bank charters erodes, and it becomes difficult to navigate and ultimately to overcome institutional inertia. A few steps like developing specialized expertise, streamlining the application process, and improving transparency can yield significant improvements.</p>
<p>First, de novo formations are very different from other bank applications where there are existing institutions with established supervisory ratings and examination records. A de novo formation has no supervisory record of performance on which to base a decision or inform judgments about whether an application is consistent with approval. Instead, regulators must evaluate the proposal based on applicable statutory requirements: Is the business plan sound? Is appropriate bank leadership in place? Does the bank have a viable business plan and strategy? Is the bank's proposal supported by sufficient capital? Should there be an expectation that all of these questions are answered exhaustively often well over a year before the bank would be formed, if it is approved?</p>
<p>In recent years de novo formations have been rare, and therefore staff tasked with evaluating these proposals do not have a recent perspective or deep well of experience from which to draw. Under our current approach, regional Reserve Banks are the primary point of contact for de novo applicants. We should consider creating a specialized resource that can be utilized by any reserve bank to assist them during the pre-filing conversations with de novo applicants. Our goal should be to facilitate new bank creation&mdash;identifying and finding achievable pathways to yes, instead of expecting and insisting on increasing requirements to unachievable levels or those that are intended to deter applicants from filing or moving forward.</p>
<p>We should also consider whether there are ways to streamline the application process, including, if needed, by recommending statutory changes. While the agencies use some common forms, de novo formations currently involve a range of regulatory approvals. A de novo applicant must apply for a bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state banking authority, deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and potentially membership or a parallel holding company formation application with the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Each regulator may be focused on different aspects of the application, and each has the right to ask for additional information as part of the application review and analysis potentially significantly extending the review timeframe. We should have clear standards of review and approval&mdash;and coordinated actions&mdash;among the state and federal regulators involved in any application. This should include clear timelines for the point at which a regulator forfeits their opportunity to object due to inaction, delay, or stalling tactics.</p>
<p>But standards for de novo approval are not always clear to applicants, which can lead to lengthy back-and-forth discussions with banking agency staff even after an applicant has prepared the information required by the appropriate application forms. The need for extensive additional information from de novo applicants can be caused by a failure to provide information requested in the application form, but I suspect the submission of incomplete information is often a product of forms that do not include all necessary information.</p>
<p>We should not need to constantly supplement application forms with ad hoc information requests. If additional information is needed, we should modify the required application forms. One area where the lack of transparent and clear standards is most evident is with the amount of capital required to establish a de novo bank. Discussions around required capital often hinge on subjective assessments based on planned business model and growth, but they rarely involve regulators providing a minimum required capital amount. Standards for approval should not be shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>Reform of the de novo applications process should not be thought of as a deregulatory exercise. Clear and transparent standards do not imply "low" or inadequate standards. At the same time, if we want to encourage a pipeline of de novo bank formations, we should also be comfortable with the uncertainty that accompanies any new business, including the risk that some de novo banks will not succeed.</p>
<p>The cost of eliminating the failure of de novo banks&mdash;or really of any banks at any time&mdash;is simply too great. Banking is fundamentally about appropriately managed risks, and regulators play a key role in promoting a system that is safe and sound while also serving to support the banking needs of customers and broader economic growth. Our goal should not be to create a banking system that is safe, sound, and ultimately irrelevant.</p>
<p><em>Mergers and Acquisitions</em><br />The issues with the banking applications process extend beyond de novo formations, but involve some of the same concerns, whether there are clear standards, and we are able to act in a timely manner. As a threshold matter, if regulators are clear about the information they need to process an application&mdash;for example, by updating applications forms to include the full set of information needed to analyze each statutory approval requirement&mdash;then we should also hold ourselves to fixed approval timelines. In my view, the purgatory of a long application process is another form of regulatory "inaction" that must be eliminated.</p>
<p>We should also address aspects of the applications process that contribute to delay, including both the approach to competition and the public comment process.</p>
<p>The banking agencies have long relied on competitive "screens" to evaluate the pro forma effect of a merger. This process looks at the standalone institutions, imagines a merger in which their operations are combined, and then looks at how measures of competition will change in the areas served by the merged institutions. Where there is overlap in markets served, there is the potential for tripping competitive screens and triggering additional scrutiny. At the Federal Reserve, when a competitive screen is triggered the application process takes more time, as staff reviews the conflict, and the matter is removed from the Reserve Bank-delegated processing track.</p>
<p>Perversely, many banks that trigger additional scrutiny operate in rural markets and have less aggregate banking business over which institutions can compete. In these concentrated markets, the analytical approach may involve a counterfactual in which only two future states of the world exist&mdash;the banks continue to operate on a standalone basis, or the banks merge and operate as a consolidated whole. However, this framing ignores a possible third option, that one or both of the institutions will cease being viable and shut its doors, or be acquired by a credit union, similarly leading to an erosion of market competition and potentially greater disruption to the communities served. This analytical approach to evaluating competition no longer remains appropriate, and it needs to be reformed to better reflect actual market realities. This must include competition from credit unions, the farm credit system, internet banks, financial technology firms and other non-banks.</p>
<p>Finally, many M&amp;A applications come to the Board due to the receipt of an adverse comment from the public about the past supervisory record of one or both of the institutions involved in a merger. The receipt of an adverse comment causes substantial delays in the processing of an application, as this too removes an application from the "delegated" processing by the local Federal Reserve Bank, escalating the matter to the Board of Governors in D.C. While it is important that regulators take into account public feedback&mdash;and indeed, is required by applicable law&mdash;we should also be concerned about comments that may lack factual support or may solely rely on matters always considered in the review of a proposal, like the existing supervisory records of the acquirer and the target institution, and may be negated by the regulator's own examination report.</p>
<p><strong>Approach to Regulation &ndash; Cleanup and the Statutory Regulatory Review</strong><br />Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act nearly 15 years ago, the body of regulations that all banks are subject to has increased dramatically. Many of the reforms made after the 2008 financial crisis were important and essential to ensuring a stronger and more resilient banking system. Yet, a number of the changes are backward looking&mdash;responding only to that mortgage crisis&mdash;not fully considering the potential future unintended consequences or future states of the world.</p>
<p>With well over a decade of change in the banking system now behind us post-implementation, it is time to evaluate whether all these changes continue to be relevant. Some of the regulations put in place immediately after that financial crisis resulted in pushing foundational banking activities out of the banking system into less regulated corners of the financial system. We need to ask whether this is appropriate. These tradeoffs are complicated, and we must consider not only the changes that were made but also the evolution of and differences in the banking system today.</p>
<p>Driving all risk out of the banking system is at odds with the fundamental nature of the business of banking. Banks, after all, are businesses. And they must be able to earn a profit and grow while also managing their risks. Adding requirements that impose more costs must be balanced with whether the new requirements make the correct tradeoffs between safety and soundness and enabling banks to serve their customers and run their businesses. The task of policymakers and regulators is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to eliminate risk from the banking system, but rather to ensure that risk is appropriately and effectively managed.</p>
<p>In a well-functioning and appropriately regulated banking system, banks serve an indispensable role in credit provision and economic stability. The goal is to create and maintain a system that supports safe and sound banking practices, and results in the implementation of appropriate risk management. No efficient banking system can eliminate all bank failures. But well-designed and well-maintained systems can limit bank failures and mitigate the harm caused by any that occur.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the regulatory framework is necessary to ensure that our regulations continue to strike the right balance between encouraging growth and innovation, and safety and soundness. One easily identifiable way to achieve this is using the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process, which the agencies initiated in February last year.</p>
<p>Although to-date it has not done so, the EGRPRA review requires the federal banking agencies to identify any outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome regulations and eliminate unnecessary regulations and take other steps to address the regulatory burdens associated with outdated or overly burdensome regulations. As I noted, prior iterations of the EGRPRA process have been underwhelming in their ability to result in meaningful change, but it is my expectation that this review, and eventually the accompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking agencies in identifying regulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome. It is also my expectation that regulators will be responsive to concerns raised by the public.</p>
<p>Another area that is ripe for review are several of the Board's rules that address core banking issues&mdash;from loans to insiders, to transactions with affiliates, to state member bank activities, and holding company requirements. Many of the Board's regulations have not been comprehensively reviewed or updated in more than 20 years. Given the dynamic nature of the banking system and how the economy and banking and financial services industries have evolved over that period, it is imperative that we update and simplify many of the Board's regulations, including thresholds for applicability and benchmarks.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to address the unintended consequences of anti-money laundering requirements in the provision of banking services. I think we can agree that fighting money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities is not only a statutory responsibility of the banking system but it also serves important public policy goals. But while the regulatory framework prescribing how banks fulfill this role is not within the Federal Reserve's responsibilities, it is important to consider how these requirements affect the ability of banks to serve customers. For example, the threshold for currency transaction reports (CTR) was established more than 50 years ago and has not been updated or indexed to inflation during that time. Just as an example, at the time it was implemented, a fully loaded Cadillac cost less than the CTR threshold. We've come a long way since 1972.</p>
<p>It has also created a regime of more extensive and invasive reporting of customers' transactions that may pose little actual risks related to tracking illicit activities. This reporting regime is also not cost-free, as banks may opt to avoid banking customers that trigger high volumes of CTR reporting, or that otherwise trigger the filing of suspicious activity reports. The calibration of reporting requirements, their effect on bank customers, and the growing problem of customer "de-banking," warrant greater public attention.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve should review the supervisory messages given to banks and their holding companies about how supervisors will evaluate and consider the bank's risks associated with customers that are caught in the Bank Secrecy Act or Anti-Money Laundering reporting web. I am concerned that this framework is being used to downgrade a bank's condition based on a disproportionate weighting of its compliance with these requirements in comparison to its overall condition. There are separate examinations conducted for this purpose, and they should be viewed separately, not as a cudgel for downgrading a bank's condition through the governance and controls mechanism or management assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />The banking system can be an engine of economic growth and opportunity, particularly when it is supported by a bank regulatory framework that is rational and well-maintained. The work of rationalizing and maintaining this system is an ongoing cycle. While my remarks today have touched on a wide range of issues that require rationalization and "maintenance," this is by no means an exhaustive list.</p>
<p>Maintaining an effective framework is not only about ensuring the existing plumbing continues to work (and making it more efficient where possible) but it also must include promoting a system that is responsive to emerging threats and the needs of the banking system. As an example, the significant increase in fraud over the past few years has not generated the strong regulatory and governmental response necessary, even though fraud can become a source of material financial risk, particularly to smaller institutions.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today. As always, it is a pleasure to be with you!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Flint has successfully led the NWF through its recent transformation, building on his leadership of the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB).</li>
<li>Since launch the NWF has unlocked &pound;1.6 billion of investment in support of the government&rsquo;s growth and clean energy missions, as part of the Plan for Change.</li>
<li>The recruitment process for his successor will start shortly.</li>
</ul>
<p>John Flint is to step down from the role of the CEO of the National Wealth Fund (NWF) in the summer after seeing through the transition from the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appointed as CEO of UKIB in 2021, Flint led the organisation from a start-up to an established feature of the UK investment and policy landscape.</p>
<p>In October 2024, UKIB was transformed into the NWF with Flint taking on the role of CEO of the new organisation. Since then, Flint has driven forward the transformation of the institution, with its broader mandate to support the government&rsquo;s growth and clean energy missions through its partnership with the private sector and local government.</p>
<p>Since its launch the NWF has invested in 11 deals, securing 8,600 jobs and unlocking &pound;1.6 billion in investment spread right across the industries that turbocharge growth in our economy as government&rsquo;s number one mission - from clean energy to digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>Backed by capitalisation of &pound;27.8 billion, the NWF has been established to mobilise over &pound;70 billion of business investment and help kickstart economic growth as part of the government&rsquo;s Plan for Change.</p>
<p>The NWF has also recently committed to trialling strategic partnerships with local government, starting in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, West Midlands, and the Glasgow City Region. These partnerships will provide enhanced, hands-on support with tailored commercial and financial advice to help regions develop and secure long-term investment opportunities.</p>
<h4 id="chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rachel-reeves-said">Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:&nbsp;</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>John Flint has been an outstanding CEO of UKIB and the NWF. He will leave behind a considerable legacy &ndash; having led the scale-up of UKIB and its transformation into the NWF. I would like to thank him and wish him well.</p>
<p class="last-child">His successor will be required to build on his work by backing businesses and our local leaders to invest in the industries of the future. In doing so we can get Britain building the infrastructure we need to grow as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="john-flint-said-">John Flint said: &nbsp;</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been a huge privilege to lead UKIB and NWF, working with some of the brightest and best of the public and private sectors. After successfully leading the transformation of UKIB into the NWF, this summer will be the right moment to hand over to a successor and look for a new challenge.</p>
<p class="last-child">I will do so feeling confident that the NWF is well positioned to mobilise billions of pounds of investment&nbsp;and play a leading role in supporting the government&rsquo;s ambitions on growth and clean energy. I will follow its future activities with interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A recruitment process to identify Flint&rsquo;s replacement will launch shortly. Flint will remain as CEO until the summer to support an orderly transition to a new CEO and to ensure that momentum is maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="john-flint-biography">John Flint biography</h2>
<p>As Chief Executive Officer of the NWF, Flint chaired the Fund&rsquo;s Executive Committee, is a member of the Board of Directors, and chairs the Investment Committee, which makes decisions on investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously Flint was Group Chief Executive of HSBC. During his 30-year career with HSBC, Flint built a range of skills in wholesale banking, retail banking, and Treasury and risk management. He represented HSBC in nine countries, spending much of his career in Asia. He progressed through the roles of Group Treasurer, Deputy Head of Global Markets, Chief Executive of HSBC Asset Management, and Chief Executive of Retail Banking and Wealth Management, before being appointed Group Chief Executive.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="ltr"><span>JP Jenkins (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.jpjenkins.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.jpjenkins.com</a>), the UK&rsquo;s largest private marketplace for unlisted securities, has today announced its first deployment of AI technology. The solution, from data science specialists Insig AI, provides access to the company&rsquo;s Transparency and Disclosure Index (TDI) reports.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Veronika Oswald, Commercial Director at JP Jenkins commented:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of hype surrounding AI but we have absolutely recognised the benefits that solutions like Insig AI&rsquo;s TDI can deliver in scrutinising corporate behaviour. With a significant volume of data to work through, AI can help form a consensus opinion with just a fraction of the resource it would take a traditional analyst team to achieve the same outcome.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Insight AI provides a ready-made toolkit that allows users to quantify and explore datasets. By searching, filtering, analysing and benchmarking company disclosures, peer group comparisons can be generated in an instant, traceable and economical manner, with the Transparency and Disclosure Index driving ESG insights.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Richard Bernstein of Insig AI added:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>The team at JP Jenkins presented us with a classic use case for AI technology. It needed the ability to rank and review the clarity and relevance of a company&rsquo;s sustainable reporting in relation to its peers. This technology allows it to identify sectoral trends and match these with data visualisations, delivering comprehensive reports quickly and efficiently. We are delighted to be partnering with JP Jenkins&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As a technology-centric company, JP Jenkins expects to make further considered AI deployments as part of its growth plans, where the business case clearly justifies such innovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On the sidelines of the inaugural annual global AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies in Al Ula, Saudi Arabia (February 16-17), Saudi Arabia's Finance Ministry and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) co-hosted a high-level roundtable on "Working Together to Support Recovery in the Middle East's Conflict-Affected Economies", with a focus on Syria,&nbsp; bringing together finance ministers of countries in the region, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, the Managing Director of Operations at the World Bank Group and heads of other International Financial Institutions and the Arab Coordination Group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the IMF, and Mohammed Aljadaan, Finance Minister of Saudi Arabia, made the following statement:</p>
<p>"This important meeting brought together representatives from the Middle East and key economic and development partners to discuss how we can work together to support recovery in the Middle East's conflict-affected economies, with a focus on Syria.</p>
<p>"We thank all participants for realizing the urgency and importance of this task, as well as for their commitment to pool knowledge and work together to ensure that the conflict-affected countries can start addressing their humanitarian needs and begin a rebuilding era for their economies in an efficient, swift, and durable way for the benefit of their people.</p>
<p>"Participants welcomed the meeting as an opportunity to discuss recent developments and build a common understanding of the challenges facing conflict-affected countries. They emphasized the importance of strengthening coordination to support the recovery of these countries as the negative spillovers would impact all. Particular attention was paid to the situation in Syria.</p>
<p>Participants agreed on the following priorities to support conflict-affected countries:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>A Continuous Diagnostic&nbsp;</b>of the challenges and [economic and social] context facing each conflict-affected country, including an assessment of humanitarian and reconstruction needs. Such a diagnostic should identify institution-building priorities, gaps in policies, and financing needs.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Capacity Development (CD)</b>&nbsp;aimed at rapidly scaling up IMF and World Bank CD initiatives to help strengthen and, as needed, build new institutions. Support would need to be tailored to strengthen essential functions of fiscal, monetary and banking institutions.</li>
<li><b>Mobilization of financial assistance from the international community</b>. Financial support&mdash;coordinated with international and regional development partners&mdash;will be needed to fund comprehensive reform programs, including reconstruction and humanitarian aid.</li>
</ul>
<p>"The IMF, World Bank, the Arab Coordination Group, and countries of the region underscored their readiness to work together and complement each other's efforts while focusing on their institutional mandates. They will continue to work closely and with other partners to further support the international response to the recovery of conflict-affected economies in the Middle East region.</p>
<p>They agreed to establish an informal coordination group to support those efforts,&nbsp; they agreed that discussions on those efforts will be continued at the upcoming&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLiiLkoSBc7ZAKaAcNgFbENJ-2B5TAloRQHVKCC36cH95RG4xLkR_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJMbsX7hEYbsKAMsOmJy-2B5u8m4TS469zFm1YJmEWiAfXI-2BS6QQa9FgJYwCQk-2Bq-2FzK5wK7xDdppmkHxKYrftBRi9p3F4z-2FfPitzLTJmx-2BFN-2BQxbTJhIn4MYlnZ0qymgqHL5KEDiHLRcPAeyGnnHYIboyuc6EhFSKasxDhEdU6hCrKjDFsbH4hfL-2BVEdgmoJOBNkUR-2FU8jwbj87Ab5gRCcxcEDKoVVf2xto0pDpmurA0MW7DXc6H724Be5Ga7CTLYmrwpK9BEpEmBXYd-2BX2xw-2FZO1OsopyYc5Fdd2Q27qMvv2rg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings on&nbsp;</a>April 25-27 in Washington, D.C."</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rangi Wyatt Stephen Savage Senior has been ordered to pay compensation of $126,214 to investors and a pecuniary penalty of $142,500 for breaching the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (the FMCA). The High Court judgment follows civil proceedings brought by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proceedings were based on a regulated public offer for the sale of shares in The Powder Shed Tokoroa Limited (Powder Shed). Mr Savage was the sole director of Powder Shed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The High Court found Mr Savage breached the FMCA by:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Making false or misleading representations &nbsp;</li>
<li>Making a regulated offer without a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Accepting an application for a transfer of financial products without a PDS.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, said: &ldquo;The FMA brought this proceeding because Mr Savage seriously undermined the main purposes of financial markets legislation. In the FMA&rsquo;s view, Mr Savage&rsquo;s conduct was deliberately misleading. Many of his investors were first time investors with little experience in financial markets and the total harm caused was significant. Bank records show Mr Savage transferred the investors&rsquo; money to his own personal bank account, and to pay debts and expenses of another company that he had incorporated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To date, Mr Savage has made no attempt to repay his investors despite claiming he would do so. The Court has ordered him to pay back investors via the FMA to ensure the investors receive their compensation. The FMA encourages New Zealanders to treat any offer of a financial product through social media with caution and to speak to a licensed financial adviser.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>The High Court found that Mr Savage made false or misleading statements from April to July 2020 in online presentations and social media videos when promoting the sale of shares in Powder Shed to potential investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the claims were that he had a suitable site, had secured a major contract, and had financial backing for the business. He also claimed a substantial dividend would be paid out in the first 12 months. None of these claims could be substantiated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At no point during the time the offers were made was a product disclosure statement lodged or provided to investors.&nbsp; The High Court found that Mr Savage&rsquo;s failure to provide a product disclosure statement meant that investors did not have the information that would have assisted them in making a decision to invest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 160 individual investors applied to purchase shares in Powder Shed. Approximately 65,000 shares were sold and issued to investors at USD$1.20 per share. Investors paid in USD or in cryptocurrency. The total amount obtained equates to approximately NZD$126,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Savage did not engage in the proceedings and a formal proof hearing was held at the High Court in Auckland on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Downs delivered judgment immediately after the hearing, declaring that Mr Savage contravened the FMCA and ordering him to pay compensation to the investors and a pecuniary penalty to the Crown. Mr Savage is required to pay the compensation to the FMA and, in turn, by the FMA to investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Downs also imposed a banning order for six years. It prohibits Mr Savage from:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a director or promotor of an entity in NZ.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Being in any way concerned in the management of an entity in NZ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Taking part in the management of an entity in NZ.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom has appointed Michael Detoy as the local government elected official on the CalPERS Board of Administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detoy hails from Southern California where he has served as a councilmember and mayor of the City of Hermosa Beach since 2019. In addition, he is a fire captain with the City of Riverside where he has served since 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We congratulate Michael on his appointment, and we welcome the perspective he brings on behalf of our local government partners,&rdquo; said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. &ldquo;His dedication to public service, both as a city leader in Hermosa Beach and as a firefighter, will serve him well in our vital mission to provide retirement security and quality health care to CalPERS members and their families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detoy, whose tenure on the board begins immediately, earned a Bachelor of Science in Finance from Santa Clara University and a Master of Public Administration from California Baptist University. He has also served as a trustee on the California Firefighters Benefits Trust and is a fiduciary trustee of the International Association of Fire Fighters Retiree Medical Trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life has been devoted to public service and I am honored for this opportunity,&rdquo; Detoy said. &ldquo;I see public service as a basic responsibility, a way of giving back to society, and I look forward to making a difference in the lives of more than 2.2 million CalPERS members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detoy will replace Lisa Middleton, a former member of the Palm Springs City Council, who was appointed to the board in May of 2019.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Lisa Middleton for her service to CalPERS, our members, employers and board,&rdquo; Frost added. &ldquo;Lisa has been part of the CalPERS family for almost six years, working tirelessly to ensure our employer partners are well-represented in every decision CalPERS makes. As the first transgender person elected to a non-judicial office in California, Lisa represents the very best of CalPERS and has been a trusted partner to her fellow board members and the executive team. We wish her the very best in the next chapter of her life and career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 13-member CalPERS Board of Administration sets policy and oversees the administration of retirement and health benefits on behalf of California public employers, and their active and retired employees. The board also oversees administration of the pension fund&rsquo;s investments. Under the California Constitution, the CalPERS Board has exclusive authority to administer the CalPERS pension fund.</p>
<p>The next board meeting will take place on Feb. 18-19.</p>

<title>SEC Charges One Oak Capital Management And Michael DeRosa With Breaching Fiduciary Duties To Clients</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against New York-based registered investment adviser One Oak Capital Management LLC, and former One Oak investment adviser representative, Michael DeRosa, for misconduct related to advisory services provided to their retail clients.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from approximately June 2020 through October 2023, One Oak and DeRosa recommended that DeRosa&rsquo;s customers at an unaffiliated broker-dealer, at which he was simultaneously employed, convert more than 180 brokerage accounts to advisory accounts at One Oak. Most of these customers were elderly and had been long-time customers of DeRosa&rsquo;s at the broker-dealer, which charged the customers on a commission basis. According to the order, One Oak and DeRosa ignored their fiduciary duty and failed to adequately disclose that the conversions from brokerage accounts to advisory accounts would result in significantly higher fees for the clients and increased compensation for DeRosa; nor did they disclose the resulting conflict of interest. The order finds that the change in fee structure resulted in significantly increased costs, but the clients generally received no additional services or benefits. The order further finds that One Oak and DeRosa failed to adequately consider whether it was in their clients&rsquo; best interests to convert their brokerage accounts to advisory accounts, and in fact, many of the accounts were not suitable to be advisory accounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remain committed to holding accountable investment advisers who breach their fiduciary duties at the expense of retail clients,&rdquo; said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;One Oak and DeRosa converted brokerage accounts to advisory accounts when it benefitted them through higher fees, but that conversion was not in their clients&rsquo; best interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that One Oak and DeRosa willfully violated the antifraud provisions of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that One Oak also violated the compliance rule provisions of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, One Oak consented to an order requiring it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and to retain an independent compliance consultant to review certain of its policies and procedures related to its retail business. Without admitting or denying the findings in the order, DeRosa agreed to a civil penalty of $75,000 and to a nine-month industry suspension.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alexander M. Levine, Hermann A. Vargas, and Liora Sukhatme under the supervision of Ms. Shah, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of Thomas Strafaci, Stephanie A. Morena, David Jaffe, and Jennifer A. Grumbrecht of the Division of Examinations in the New York Regional Office.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s securities and markets regulator launches today a Common Supervisory Action (CSA) with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) on compliance and internal audit functions of UCITS management companies and Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMs) across the EU.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The CSA will be conducted throughout 2025 and aims to assess to what extent UCITS management companies and AIFMs have established effective compliance and internal audit functions with the adequate staffing, authority, knowledge, and expertise to perform their duties under the AIFM and UCITS Directives.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Compliance and internal audit functions are designed to ensure that the internal control mechanisms to monitor, identify, measure, and mitigate any possible risks of non-compliance with the applicable rules are in place. Therefore, ensuring that the entities have robust internal controls is crucial to avoid investor detriment and preserve financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The work will be done using a common assessment framework developed by ESMA, which sets out the scope, methodology, supervisory expectations, and timeline on how to carry out a comprehensive supervisory action in a convergent manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">During the year, NCAs will share knowledge and experiences through ESMA to foster convergence in how they supervise the compliance of UCITS management companies and AIFMs with the relevant rules in the area.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will publish a final report with the results of the exercise in 2026.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today announced Brian Young will serve as the agency&rsquo;s Director of Enforcement. Young has been serving in an acting capacity since January 22, and previously was the Director of the Whistleblower Office. He is a distinguished federal prosecutor with nearly 20 years of service at the Department of Justice, including Acting Director of Litigation for the Antitrust Division and Chief of the Litigation Unit for the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division, and has successfully tried some of the most high-profile criminal fraud and manipulation cases in the CFTC&rsquo;s markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian exemplifies the best of what we stand for at the CFTC,&rdquo; said Acting Chairman Pham. &ldquo;He is a fearless leader that will build an even more impressive enforcement program that will stay true to the CFTC&rsquo;s mission to protect the American public from fraudsters and scammers. I am confident that under Brian&rsquo;s leadership, the CFTC will expand and scale our resources to help more victims than ever before and ensure the integrity of our markets in the name of justice. Brian has hit the ground running and I look forward to seeing his continued impact to strengthen the Division of Enforcement and deliver results.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Acting Chairman Pham for her confidence in me and for her commitment to continuing the CFTC&rsquo;s aggressive efforts to protect our global commodity markets from fraud, manipulation, and other abusive practices,&rdquo; said Young. &ldquo;As former Director of the Whistleblower Officer, I worked closely with the talented and dedicated staff of the Division of Enforcement, and I look forward to working with this highly motivated group to help bring justice for victims, protect those who cannot protect themselves, and root out misconduct and wrongdoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Brian Young, Director of Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Young joined the CFTC in 2024 as the Director of the Whistleblower Office following nearly 20 years at the Department of Justice. During his first year as the Director of the Whistleblower Office, Young oversaw a team that achieved a record high number of annual dispositions of whistleblower award applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CloudMargin, a leading global collateral management technology company, last night won the FOW International Award for Collateral Management Solution of the Year. The honour, presented in London at a ceremony following the FOW Trading London 2025 conference, marked the fifth win in the collateral management category for the company, which celebrated its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2024.</p>
<p>The FOW International Awards recognise the &ldquo;best and brightest innovations in the derivatives industry.&rdquo; A panel of independent, expert judges with experience across the derivatives markets select the winners. Among their comments were that CloudMargin is a &ldquo;very strong provider&rdquo; with an &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; client testimonial that accompanied the nomination. Another said: &ldquo;Source agnostic / centralisation of cross-asset data to manage workflows enterprise-wide on a single platform and optimisation of inventory usage&rdquo; is &ldquo;very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CloudMargin CEO Stuart Connolly said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re incredibly honoured to accept this award from FOW following a monumental year for our company. We reached landmark agreements with some of the world&rsquo;s leading banks and asset servicing firms. We took on a host of new clients on our continuously updated cloud platform, to help them solve significant collateral and margin challenges in the face of market forces and pressure to control costs. And we continue to see the strongest pipeline in our history, as we help firms onboard quickly so they can benefit from automated end-to-end collateral management and access managed connectivity to the broader industry ecosystem. None of this could be achieved without the CloudMargin team&rsquo;s tremendous dedication, ability to meet challenges and solve problems, and continual focus on our clients that enables us to keep improving and growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CloudMargin platform was accessed throughout the year in 52 countries, processing nearly 1 million margin calls. On its busiest day in 2024, CloudMargin facilitated the exchange of more than $20 billion in collateral by its clients.</p>
<p>Clients of the firm include asset managers, pension funds, banks, brokerages, insurance firms, fund administrators, outsourcers and major industry service providers using the CloudMargin platform to manage collateral for cleared and uncleared over-the-counter (OTC) products, exchange-traded derivatives, repo forward securities and securities lending products.</p>
<p>Supporting the firm&rsquo;s continued trajectory of growth, innovation and market leadership, CloudMargin recently launched a new version of its corporate website, <a href="https://www.cloudmargin.com/">cloudmargin.com</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Malaysia Co-Investment Fund (MyCIF) will host a roadshow in Penang on 18 February 2025 to promote the fund to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Kedah, Penang, Perlis and northern Perak.</p>
<p>MyCIF is Malaysia's first public-private co-investment model, leveraging equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to peer (P2P) financing platforms to support MSMEs. It was established under Federal Budget 2019 by the Ministry of Finance and administered by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC).</p>
<p>MyCIF implements a 1:4 co-investment ratio for the General Scheme and a 1:2 coinvestment ratio for the Food Security Scheme and Environmental and Social Impact Scheme.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised by the SC in partnership with the Northern Corridor Implementation Authority (NCIA), the one-day MyCIF roadshow will also feature an overview of equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to-peer (P2P) financing as alternative financing avenues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, this collaboration leverages NCIA&rsquo;s extensive experience in empowering business communities within the Northern Corridor Economic Region (NCER), which encompasses Penang, Perak, Kedah, and Perlis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This roadshow aims to enhance access to financing for businesses in the Northern region while raising awareness of MyCIF, ECF and P2P in supporting MSMEs. Currently, there are over 220,000 MSMEs in the Northern region playing a crucial role in contributing to the northern economy.</p>
<p>Themed &ldquo;Empowering Financing, Advancing Growth,&rdquo; the event will be held at The Light Hotel Penang in Seberang Jaya.</p>
<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to network with SC-registered ECF and P2P platform operators as well as government agencies expected to attend. In addition, there will be a series of breakout sessions and exhibitors dedicated to addressing the fundraising needs of businesses, providing valuable insights into alternative financing options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering its sixth year, MyCIF has played a pivotal role in improving access to the alternative financing sector while fostering the growth of MSMEs in the local start-up ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two Estonian nationals pleaded guilty yesterday for their operation of a massive, multi-faceted cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme that victimized hundreds of thousands of people from across the world, including in the United States.&nbsp;As part of the defendants&rsquo; guilty pleas, they agreed to forfeit assets valued over $400 million obtained during the conspiracy.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Tur&otilde;gin, both 40,&nbsp;sold contracts to customers entitling them to a share of cryptocurrency mined by the defendants&rsquo; purported cryptocurrency mining service, HashFlare. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of using computers to generate cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for profit.</p>
<p>Between 2015 and 2019, Hashflare&rsquo;s sales totaled more than $577 million, but HashFlare did not possess the requisite computing capacity to perform the vast majority of the mining the defendants told HashFlare customers it performed. HashFlare&rsquo;s web-based dashboard, which purported to show customers their mining profits, instead reflected falsified data. Potapenko and Tur&otilde;gin used the proceeds of the fraud conspiracy to purchase real estate and luxury vehicles and maintained investment and cryptocurrency accounts. Potapenko and Tur&otilde;gin have agreed to forfeit assets worth, as of the date of the plea, more than $400 million. The forfeited assets will be available for a remission process to compensate victims of the crime. Details about the remission process will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Potapenko and Tur&otilde;gin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They are scheduled to be sentenced on May 8 and each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>The Justice Department thanks the Cybercrime Bureau of the Estonian Police and Border Guard for its support with this investigation. The Estonian Prosecutor General and Ministry of Justice and Digital Affairs provided substantial assistance with the extradition. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs provided extensive assistance to the investigation and the extradition of the defendants.</p>
<p>Supervisory Official Antoinette T. Bacon of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller for the Western District of Washington, Assistant Director Chad Yarbrough of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division, and Special Agent in Charge W. Mike Herrington of the FBI Seattle Field Office made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI Seattle Field Office investigated the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorneys Adrienne E. Rosen and David Ginensky of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew Friedman and Sok Jiang for the Western District of Washington are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jehiel Baer for the Western District of Washington is handling asset forfeiture aspects of the case.</p>

<title>Europe’s First CLO ETF Now Listed On LuxSE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Luxembourg Stock Exchange is pleased to confirm the listing of Fair Oaks Capital&rsquo;s trailblazing CLO ETF on the regulated Bourse de Luxembourg market on 6 February. The new GBP-hedged share class has been created under the Fair Oaks AAA CLO sub-fund on the Alpha UCITS SICAV fund platform.</p>
<p>The Fair Oaks AAA CLO fund invests long-only and exclusively in AAA-rated collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), based on Fair Oaks' established investment processes. The CLO-focused fund furthermore complies with ESG investment restrictions and is classified as Article 8 under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The addition of the industry&rsquo;s first GBP hedged option to access AAA-rated CLOs will enable additional investors to consider the asset class as an alternative for fixed-rate products such as investment grade corporate bonds&rdquo;, Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro, Partner at Fair Oaks Capital, commented, &ldquo;all while benefiting from a track record of considerably lower volatility over the last 5 years, on account of their minimal interest rate risk. AAA-rated CLOs have a history of zero defaults and offer attractive yields, with a considerably higher spread than investment-grade corporates.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Europe&rsquo;s leading fund centre</b></p>
<p>As the second largest fund centre in the world after the United States, Luxembourg has a fund industry that currently holds more than EUR 5.8 trillion in assets under management according to figures from the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (ALFI). The financial centre has put in place a number of initiatives and is becoming an increasingly attractive domicile for active ETFs. As a leading listing venue for a wide array of investment funds, including UCITS, AIFs and ETFs, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange has built up a unique experience in fund listings and is now increasing its focus on actively managed exchange traded funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to welcome this pioneering fund from Fair Oaks Capital to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This is a testament to our unique expertise in the listing of investment funds and the fast time-to-market we provide to Luxembourg-domiciled regulated funds. A listing at LuxSE furthermore serves to boost the fund&rsquo;s liquidity on secondary markets,&rdquo; commented Arnaud Delestienne, Director of International Capital Markets and Member of the Executive Committee at LuxSE.</p>
<p>A LuxSE Partner, Luxembourg-based law firm Elvinger Hoss Prussen advised Fair Oaks Capital in connection with the listing of this fund at LuxSE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luxembourg has recently taken measures to enhance the framework for actively managed ETFs, such as the relaxation of portfolio transparency rules and the abolition of the subscription tax. The listing process of the Fair Oaks AAA CLO ETF on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange was smooth and timely, accelerating the admission on other venues and facilitating the development of a secondary market liquidity in Europe,&rdquo; added Yves Elvinger, Partner at Elvinger Hoss Prussen.</p>
<p><b>Pioneering the European CLO ETF market</b></p>
<p>Fair Oaks Capital established the FAAA CLO ETF in Luxembourg in September 2024, becoming the first investment manager to launch a European-domiciled CLO ETF. This specific type of investment fund offers investors across Europe access to a diversified portfolio of CLOs in an actively managed exchange traded fund, bringing diversification to traditional, fixed-income portfolios. The ETF format allows for efficient and flexible trading while offering investors a higher level of transparency.</p>
<p>Established in 2013 and operating from London&nbsp;and&nbsp;New York, Fair Oaks Capital specialises in CLOs and secured loans, currently managing USD 3 billion&nbsp;in assets for a global client base.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) released economic and financial market scenarios for use in the upcoming stress tests for covered institutions.</p>
<p>The supervisory scenarios include baseline and severely adverse scenarios. Covered institutions are required to use the scenarios to conduct stress tests. The results of the company-run stress tests provide the OCC with forward-looking information used in bank supervision and assist the agency in assessing a covered institution&rsquo;s risk profile and capital adequacy.</p>
<p>Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, requires certain financial companies, including certain national banks and federal savings associations, to conduct periodic stress tests.</p>
<p>The 2025 scenario and background information can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/forms/dodd-frank-act-stress-test/index-dodd-frank-act-stress-test.html" title="Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run)">OCC&rsquo;s Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run) page</a>. The final policy statement on the development and distribution of the scenarios was issued on October 28, 2013, in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext, the&nbsp;leading European capital market infrastructure, today publishes its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Full year 2024 revenue and income was up +10.3% at &euro;1,626.9 million:</span></li>
<li>Non-volume related revenue and income represented 58% of total revenueand income (compared to 60% in 2023) and covered 153% of underlying operating expenses, excluding D&amp;A0F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;(vs. 145% in 2023):</li>
<li>Custody and Settlement revenue grew to &euro;270.5 million (+8.7%), driven by higher assets under custody, dynamic settlement activity and strong growth of value-added services;</li>
<li>Advanced Data Services revenue grew to &euro;241.7 million (+7.5%), driven by continued demand for fixed income trading data, power trading data and dynamic retail usage. Revenue was supported by the acquisition of GRSS, a leading provider of services to benchmark administrators;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Listing revenue grew to &euro;231.9 million (+5.1%), despite headwinds from the NOK1F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;depreciation. This reflects the continued strong performance of corporate solutions and resilient listing revenue. With 53 new equity listings and over 14,700 new bond listings in 2024, Euronext confirms its leading European position in equity listing and its worldwide leadership in debt listing;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Technology Solutions reported &euro;106.2 million of revenue (-3.4%), reflecting<a class="ck-anchor" id="_Hlk179554977">&nbsp;the termination of Borsa Italiana legacy services in March 2024 following the migration to Optiq</a>&reg;.</li>
<li>Trading revenue grew to &euro;559.4 million (+14.2%), driven by record results in fixed income, FX and power trading and solid growth in cash trading revenue;</li>
<li>Clearing revenue grew to &euro;144.3 million (+19.0%), powered by the European expansion of Euronext Clearing, dynamic fixed income activity and the strong performance of commodities clearing. Net&nbsp;treasury income was at &euro;56.8 million (+21.8%).</li>
<li><span>Underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A<span>1</span>&nbsp;were in line with the revised guidance of &euro;620 million, at &euro;620.5 million (+1.7% compared to 2023)</span>. Cost discipline, synergies, and positive one-off items partly offset growth investments and acquisition impacts.</li>
<li><span>Adjusted EBITDA<span>1</span>&nbsp;was &euro;1,006.4 million (+16.4%) and adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.9% (+3.3pts).</span></li>
<li><span>Adjusted net income<span>1</span>&nbsp;was &euro;682.5 million (+16.7%) and adjusted EPS was &euro;6.59 (+19.6%).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Reported net income was &euro;585.6 million (+14.0%),&nbsp;</span>despite the negative comparison base related to the &euro;41.6 million capital gain received in 2023 for the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s 11.1% stake in LCH SA.</li>
<li><span>Net debt to EBITDA</span>2F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn3"><span>[3]</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>was at 1.4x at the end of December 2024, within Euronext&rsquo;s target range.&nbsp;</span>Euronext&rsquo;s S&amp;P rating was upgraded to &lsquo;A-, Stable Outlook&rsquo; in February&nbsp;2025.</li>
<li><span>Achievement of 2024 financial targets is confirmed.&nbsp;</span>Euronext revenue reached +4.7% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024</span>, above the +3% to +4% targeted. Euronext attained an adjusted EBITDA growth of +6.4% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024</span>, above the +5% to +6% targeted.</li>

<li><span>Dividend proposal to the 2025 Annual General Meeting</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A dividend of &euro;292.8 million will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2025. This represents 50% of 2024 reported net income, in line with Euronext&rsquo;s dividend policy. This dividend represents an increase of +14.0% compared to 20235F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn6">[6]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext continues its cost discipline and invests in strategic growth&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, Euronext reported underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) in line with the revised guidance of &euro;620 million. This compares to an initial guidance of &euro;625 million, which did not take into account the impact of any acquisitions executed over the course of 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2024 normalised underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) were at approximately &euro;640 million, taking into account approximately &euro;8 million of positive one-off items and the full-year impact of bolt-on acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euronext expects its total underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) for 2025 to be around &euro;670 million. Euronext&nbsp;expects its 2025 underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) to be stable at around &euro;640 million compared to 2024 normalised underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A), as savings and synergies are expected to entirely offset inflationary impacts. In addition, Euronext plans to invest around 5% of its normalised underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) to deliver strategic growth projects, as highlighted during the Investor Day on 8 November 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Progress with the delivery of &ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo;</span></li>
<li>Euronext will accelerate the delivery of its power futures ambition with the contemplated acquisition of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business, announced on 28 January 2025.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Euronext continues to leverage its clearing house to launch innovative derivatives products. Euronext will launch fixed income derivatives on major European government bonds, including the first-ever cash-settled mini futures in September 2025, delivering unparalleled accessibility and flexibility to investors.</li>
<li>Euronext announced a strategic collaboration with Euroclear to enhance Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management offering. This collaboration is a major enabler of Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to expand its leading Italian repo clearing franchise&nbsp;to a large range of European government bonds.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p><em>"In 2024, we delivered double-digit topline growth thanks to the solid performance of non-volume related activities, excellent performance of FICC trading, and the successful clearing expansion in Europe. For the first time, Euronext reached the significant threshold of over &euro;1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an increase of +16.4% compared to last year. Our notable adjusted net income growth of +16.7% compared to last year, to &euro;682.5 million underscores our profitability and our robust financial health. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +19.6% in 2024, at &euro;6.59 per share, compared to &euro;5.51 per share in 2023. This increase reflects Euronext&rsquo;s strong performance and a lower number of outstanding shares over 2024 due to Euronext&rsquo;s share repurchase programme.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2024, Euronext achieved several key milestones that allowed us to expand our presence across the entire capital markets value chain, as we have finalised the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group. We have exceeded our 2024 financial targets for revenue and EBITDA growth. We have also strengthened our non-volume business with strategic acquisitions such as GRSS, Substantive Research, and Acupay.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;In 2025, we are building the foundations to achieve our 2027 growth targets and we are investing to innovate for growth. We have already begun with the announced acquisition of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business</em>6F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn7"><em><span>[7]</span></em></a><em>. This addition will significantly contribute to the growth of our FICC trading and clearing business. We are pleased to announce the most significant innovation in financial derivatives in recent years, the launch of cash-settled mini futures on European government bonds. Finally, we have made a first major step in the expansion of our Repo clearing franchise through a strategic collaboration with Euroclear to enhance Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management offering. Euronext has promising growth opportunities ahead, which will further reinforce our position as the leading capital market infrastructure in Europe."</em></p>

<ul>
<li><span>2024 revenue and income</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s revenue and income was &euro;1,626.9 million, up +10.3% compared to 2023. This resulted from solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses, a dynamic trading environment across asset classes, and the positive contribution of the Euronext Clearing European expansion.</li>
<li>On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +10.0% in 2024, at &euro;1,618.2 million, compared to 2023.</li>
<li>Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2024, compared to 60% in 2023. This reflects the strong growth in trading and post-trade revenue, and solid performance of non-volume-related revenue. Non-volume-related revenue covered 153% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A, compared to 145% in 2023.</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
<li><span>2024 adjusted EBITDA</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly to &euro;620.5million, up +1.7%, in line with the revised guidance of &euro;620 million, and lower than the initial guidance of &euro;625 million. Cost discipline, FX impacts and positive one-offs (around &euro;8.3 million) partly offset growth investments and acquisitions impacts.</p>
<p>On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +1.0% compared to 2023, which highlights the impact of acquisitions on a reported basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the year totalled &euro;1,006.4 million, up +16.4% compared to 2023. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 61.9%, up +3.3 points compared to 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for 2024 was up +16.3%, to &euro;1,003.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.0%, up +3.4 points compared to 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>2024 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;188.7 million in 2024, up +10.9%, resulting from migration projects and acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;81.2 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</p>
<p>2024 adjusted operating profit was &euro;922.9 million, up +16.8% compared to 2023 adjusted operating profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&euro;136.1 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in 2024, related to the implementation of the &lsquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Net financing income for 2024 was &euro;17.5 million, compared to a net financing expense of &euro;0.2<span>&nbsp;</span>million in 2023. This increase resulted from higher interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash generation, offsetting the cost of debt in 2024.</p>
<p>Results from equity investments amounted to &euro;34.7 million in 2024, including &euro;23.4 million of dividend received from Euroclear and the &euro;10.1 million of dividend earned from Sicovam. In 2023, Euronext reported &euro;83.1 million of results from equity investments. This was a result of the capital gain on the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s stake in LCH SA and the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s investment in Tokeny, as well as the dividend received from Euroclear and Sicovam.</p>
<p>Income tax for 2024 was &euro;218.4 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.0% for 2024. In 2023, the income tax rate was 23.3%, positively impacted by non-taxable income. Income tax amounted to &euro;162.7 million.</p>
<p>Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;35.1 million in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, increased by +14.0% for 2024 compared to 2023, to &euro;585.6 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;5.65 basic and &euro;5.63 diluted in 2024, compared to &euro;4.84 basic and &euro;4.83 diluted in 2023. This increase reflects the strong results and a lower number of shares over 2024 compared to 2023.</p>
<p>Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +16.7% to &euro;682.5 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +19.6% in 2024, at &euro;6.59 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;5.51 per share in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weighted number of shares used over 2024 was 103,578,980 for the basic calculation and 103,983,870 for the diluted calculation, compared to&nbsp;106,051,799 and 106,376,338 respectively over 2023.</p>
<p>In 2024, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;708.6 million, compared to &euro;826.1 million in 2023. The difference results from higher profit before tax, higher income tax, lower results from equity investments and negative changes in working capital. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 72.3% of EBITDA in 2024.</p>

<li><span>Q4 2024 revenue and income</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In Q4 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s revenue and income amounted to &euro;415.8 million, up +11.1% compared to Q4 2023, driven by record performance in fixed income trading, robust results in non-volume related businesses and the positive contribution of the Euronext Clearing European expansion at the end of November 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext revenue and income were up +9.9% in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023, to &euro;411.1 million.</p>
<p>Non-volume related revenue accounted for 59% of Group revenue in Q4 2024, compared to 60% in Q4 2023, reflecting continued strong performance of trading and post-trade in Q4 2024. The&nbsp;underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 151% in Q4 2024, compared to 141% in Q4 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q4 2024 adjusted EBITDA</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +3.4% to &euro;163.2 million, reflecting investments in growth and the impact of acquisitions. On a like-for-like basis, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +1.1% compared to Q4 2023, reflecting mainly the impact of acquisitions on a reported basis.</p>
<p>Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled &euro;252.6 million, up +16.7% compared to Q4 2023. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 60.7%, up +2.9 points compared to Q4 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2024 was up +16.4%, to &euro;251.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.2%, up +3.4 points compared to the same perimeter in Q4 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q4 2024 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;49.6 million in Q4 2024, +8.7% more than in Q4 2023 due to the impact of migration projects and acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;20.7 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</p>
<p>Adjusted operating profit was &euro;231.1 million, up +17.7% compared to Q4 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating profit was up +17.3% compared to Q4 2023, at &euro;230.1 million.</p>
<p>&euro;39.3 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in Q4 2024, related to the final steps of the Borsa Italiana Group integration and the PPA of acquired businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Net financing income for Q4 2024 was &euro;6.5 million, compared to &euro;4.7 million in Q4 2023. This increase results from higher interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash generation, offsetting the cost of debt.</p>
<p>Results from equity investments amounted to &euro;10.1 million in Q4 2024, representing the dividend received from Sicovam. As a reminder, in Q4 2023, Euronext reported &euro;17.0 million of results from equity investments due to the capital gain related to the disposal of the stake in Tokeny and the dividend received from Sicovam.</p>
<p>Income tax for Q4 2024 was &euro;55.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.6% for the quarter. (Q4 2023: &euro;40.0 million and 22.6% respectively, reflecting the positive impact of the tax-exempted one-off capital gain from the disposal of the Tokeny stake).</p>
<p>Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;8.2 million in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, increased by +10.8% for Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023, to &euro;144.6 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;1.40 basic and &euro;1.39 diluted in Q4 2024, compared to &euro;1.25 basic and &euro;1.24 diluted in Q4 2023. Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +16.3% to &euro;172.3 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +16.9% in Q4 2024, at &euro;1.66 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;1.42 per share in Q4 2023. This increase reflects higher profit and a lower number of outstanding shares over the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weighted number of shares used over 2024 was 103,578,980 for the basic calculation and 103,983,870 for the diluted calculation, compared to 106,051,799 and 106,376,338 respectively over 2023.</p>
<p>In Q4 2024, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;175.0 million, compared to &euro;194.5 million in Q4 2023, reflecting negative changes in working capital from short-term movement in outstanding power sales customers&rsquo; and suppliers&rsquo; invoices related to Nord Pool CCP activities and higher income tax. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 64.3% of EBITDA in Q4 2024.</p>

<p>Power trading revenue reached &euro;11.3 million in Q4 2024, up +8.8% compared to Q4 2023, reflecting continued strong growth in intraday volumes and lower day-ahead volumes due to milder temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, power trading revenue was up +10.1% compared to Q4&nbsp;2023. This reflects the negative impact from the NOK depreciation on a reported basis.</p>

<p>Clearing revenue was up +1.8% to &euro;32.9<span>&nbsp;</span>million in Q4 2024, reflecting the increase in equity clearing volumes following the expansion of Euronext Clearing in November 2023, as well as dynamic commodity and retail bond clearing volumes, offset by the low volatility environment for equity derivatives. Euronext has internalised the clearing and net treasury income related to its derivatives flows in September 2024. Euronext therefore no longer receives revenue and net treasury income from LCH SA, previously recorded under non-volume related clearing revenue. Non-volume related clearing revenue, mostly related to membership fees, accounted for &euro;8.4 million of the total clearing revenue in Q4 2024. On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, clearing revenue was up +1.8% compared to Q4 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Net treasury income&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Net treasury income amounted to &euro;17.9 million in Q4 2024. The +53.3% increase compared to Q4 2023 reflects the increased level of cash collateral posted to the CCP following the migration of derivatives clearing for all Euronext markets to Euronext Clearing.</p>

<p>Corporate highlights since 1 January 2025</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext to acquire Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 28 January 2025, Euronext and Nasdaq announced the signing of a binding agreement under which Euronext will acquire Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business, subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The agreement entails the transfer of existing open positions in Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power derivatives, currently held in Nasdaq Clearing, to Euronext Clearing, with approval of the members. Trading of power futures will be operated from Euronext Amsterdam and will be cleared through Euronext Clearing. Nasdaq Clearing AB, Nasdaq Oslo ASA, and their respective infrastructure are not included in the sale. Nasdaq will continue to operate its European Markets Services business and multi-asset clearing house.</p>
<p>The anticipated combination of Euronext Nord Pool&rsquo;s market initiative with Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business is fully aligned with Euronext&rsquo;s &ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo; strategic priority to expand in power and accelerates the delivery of Euronext&rsquo;s power futures ambitions. The transaction complies with Euronext&rsquo;s capital allocation policy and will be fully financed with existing cash.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext upgraded to A-, stable outlook, by S&amp;P</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 3 February 2025, Euronext welcomed the decision of S&amp;P to upgrade Euronext from &lsquo;BBB+, Positive Outlook&rsquo; to &lsquo;A-, Stable Outlook&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>S&amp;P&rsquo;s decision reflects the completion of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group, the successful expansion of Euronext Clearing and the continued deleveraging thanks to the Group's strong cash flow generation.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ongoing share buyback programme</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 7 November 2024, Euronext announced a share repurchase programme for a maximum amount of &euro;300 million. This programme is enabled by Euronext&rsquo;s strong cash generation capabilities and demonstrates Euronext&rsquo;s rigorous capital allocation strategy. Weekly reporting updates about the share repurchase programme are being published in the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/investor-relations/capital-and-shareholding/share-buyback-program">Share Buyback Programme</a>&nbsp;section of our website. As of 7 February 2025, a total of 1,821,023 shares had been repurchased, representing 65.3% of the repurchase programme.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fixed income derivatives status update</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext announces the launch of fixed income derivatives on major European government bonds, marking a significant innovation in financial derivatives. This new offering includes the first-ever mini futures to be cash-settled on European government bonds, designed to provide greater accessibility and flexibility for retail investors, asset managers, and private investors. Powered by the Optiq&reg; trading platform and supported by dedicated market makers and Euronext Clearing, these derivatives will be introduced on the Euronext Derivatives Milan market in September 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext volumes for January 2025</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In January 2025, the average daily transaction value on the Euronext cash order book stood at &euro;11,538 million, up 23.1% compared to the same period last year. The overall average daily volume on Euronext derivatives stood at 606,267 lots, up +5.1%% compared to January 2024, and the open interest was 23,064,793 contracts at the end of January 2025, up +4.5% compared to January 2024. The average daily volume on Euronext FX&rsquo;s spot foreign exchange market stood at $27.7 billion, up +11.2% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>MTS Cash average daily volumes were up +57.5% to &euro;50.8 billion in January 2025, MTS Repo term adjusted&nbsp;</p>
<p>average daily volume stood at &euro;467.6 billion, up +3.5% compared to the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euronext Clearing cleared 23,472,063 shares in January 2025, +20.9% compared to January 2024. &euro;2,782.6 billion of wholesale bonds were cleared in January 2025 (double counted), up +2.8% compared to the same period in 2024. 1,464,522 bond retail contracts were cleared in January 2025 (double counted), up +11.9% compared to January 2024. The number of derivatives contracts cleared was 13,337,872, +606.4% compared to January 2024 (single counted). This strong increase is due to the fact that the commodity derivatives of Euronext legacy markets have been integrated following the Euronext Clearing expansion that occurred on 15 July 2024, and financial derivatives of Euronext legacy markets have been integrated following the Euronext Clearing expansion that occurred on 9 September 2024. Euronext Securities reported 13,048,702 settlement instructions in January 2025, up +14.9% compared to the same period last year. The total Assets Under Custody reached over &euro;7 trillion in January 2025, up +7.2%.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext announces strategic collaboration with Euroclear to enhance Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management offering</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 11 February 2025, Euronext announced a new collaboration with Euroclear to support the development of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management services for repo and other asset classes. This collaboration is a first major step to enable Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to expand its leading Italian repo clearing franchise to a large range of European government bonds bringing an efficient value offering to European and international clients. This collaboration will pave the way for the rollout of Euronext&rsquo;s new repo clearing offering in June 2025, enabling the onboarding of clients including international banks, with an updated risk framework. Clients will be able to use Euroclear as a triparty agent for repo clearing.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has launched today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-amendments-rts-settlement-discipline">consultation</a>&nbsp;on settlement discipline, with the objective of improving settlement efficiency across various areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA is consulting on a set of proposals to amend the technical standards on settlement discipline that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduced timeframes for allocations and confirmations,</li>
<li>the use of electronic, machine-readable allocations and confirmations according to international standards, and</li>
<li>the implementation of hold &amp; release and partial settlement by all central securities depositories.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA also wants to gather stakeholders' views on additional measures that could potentially enhance settlement efficiency, for which there are no specific policy proposals yet.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">This consultation takes into account the transition to T+1 in the European Union and the legislative proposal published by the Commission on 12 February 2025. &nbsp;It is aligned with the roadmap outlined in ESMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/ESMA74-2119945925-1969_Report_on_shortening_settlement_cycle.pdf">Final Report on Shortening the Settlement Cycle</a>.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will consider the feedback to this consultation until&nbsp;<span>14 April 2025</span>&nbsp;and expects to publish a final report and submit the draft technical standards to the European Commission (EC) by October 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies, organized jointly by the Saudi Ministry of Finance and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), kicks off next week February 16-17, 2025 in AlUla, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The annual high-level event is a prominent global platform aimed at promoting dialogue and cooperation regarding the economic challenges facing emerging markets, in the context of structural transformations of the global economy, by bringing together decision makers, prominent economists, and experts from around the world.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Saudi Minister of Finance, Mr. Mohammed&nbsp;Aljadaan, said the conference would be a unique platform for the exchange of knowledge, fostering informed decision-making and advancing policy discussions. It will provide an opportunity to engage on regional and global economic developments and to discuss policies and reforms aimed at promoting prosperity and resilience. This underscores the Kingdom's strong partnership with the IMF, and comes less than a year after the IMF established its regional office in Riyadh, to support the region's economies by providing technical assistance which contribute to achieving sustainable development for those countries.</p>
<p>Minister Aljadaan said the conference will discuss the economic challenges facing emerging markets and developing economies, including sluggish growth, constrained fiscal space, and rising financing needs while public debt is elevated. It will contribute to the provision of effective solutions to deal with these challenges. In addition, he said the Conference would highlight opportunities for emerging markets and developing economies to enhance cooperation and improve their economic growth and resilience.</p>
<p>Her Excellency the Managing Director of the IMF, Dr. Kristalina Georgieva, said "The inaugural AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies comes at a time of significant economic transformations. The Conference provides an important platform to bring together policymakers, the private sector, and key stakeholders to discuss ways in which emerging market countries can seize the opportunities of these economic transformations, lift up their competitiveness, and enjoy strong private sector-led growth".</p>
<p>"The joint Conference is a reflection of the deepening partnership between Saudi Arabia and the IMF, where Minister Aljadaan serves as Chair of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). This partnership is rooted in a common goal of building vibrant and resilient economies." Dr.&nbsp; Georgieva added.</p>
<p>The Conference will include several key sessions and themes, including monetary and fiscal policies concerning emerging markets and developing economies, the importance of those policies for macroeconomic and financial stability, and innovative solutions to sovereign debt management. It will also address the role of modern technology and artificial intelligence in supporting economic development.</p>

<title>REMIT Breach: French Regulator Fines Danske Commodities A/S €8 Million And Equinor ASA €4 Million For Manipulating The Gas Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 20 January 2025, the Dispute Settlement and Sanctions Committee (CoRDiS) of the French energy regulatory authority (CRE) imposed an &euro;8 million fine on Danske Commodities A/S and a &euro;4 million fine on Equinor ASA<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for manipulating annual capacity auctions at the virtual interconnection point between France and Spain (PIR Pirineos) in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>These penalties come under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGVw9QUARXB0wKU1BUHVYKBAIdUAkHURoGBABUBVFUVlADUgUdVwAAAlxVBQYdWw8DUh0GWlVRGgwBAwcZBAEAAAFXAARXBVoCRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011</a>, which prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>In its decision, CoRDiS found that Danske Commodities A/S, in collusion with Equinor ASA, had booked higher volumes of transmission capacity than those offered in the first round of PRISMA annual gas capacity auctions for PIR Pirineos in July 2019 and July 2020. This was done without the intention of acquiring such capacity, sending false or misleading signals regarding the demand for annual gas transmission capacity from France to Spain via the PIR Pirineos interconnection point.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that the objective of this behaviour was to create market congestion and prevent the application of multipliers to the prices of gas transmission capacities on the infra-annual market, which are meant to incentivise the booking of annual transmission capacities. By placing non-genuine offers in the first round of auctions for annual gas transmission capacity and creating congestion, Danske Commodities A/S and Equinor ASA prevented the application of multipliers, reducing the price of gas transmission capacities on the infra-annual market and setting the market price at an artificial level.</p>
<p>CoRDiS considers this behaviour a violation of REMIT Article 5, which prohibits actions that give&nbsp;or are likely to give&nbsp;false or misleading signals about the supply, demand, or price of wholesale energy products, or which secure or are likely to secure the price at an artificial level.</p>
<p>ACER welcomes this first REMIT decision of 2025 and appreciates CRE&rsquo;s continued efforts to strengthen market integrity.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The FCA has charged Mrs Lisa Campbell with multiple criminal offences, including fraud by abuse of position and providing false or misleading information to the FCA to conceal her wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mrs Campbell was the sole director of Campbell &amp; Associates Independent Financial Advice Ltd (Campbell &amp; Associates), an FCA authorised financial advisory firm which operated under the name Campbell &amp; Raffle Independent Financial Advice Ltd until November 2020. The firm provided financial advice on investments, insurance, and pensions, but was not authorised to hold or control client money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA alleges that between 1 April 2013 and 10 May 2023, Mrs Campbell misappropriated funds from clients on numerous occasions. The allegations include that Mrs Campbell created multiple false documents which she used to falsely reassure her clients that their money had been invested. In addition, the FCA alleges that Mrs Campbell provided false documents to the FCA in an effort to conceal her criminal behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the period, the FCA alleges that Mrs Campbell stole more than &pound;2.3m, leading to significant financial losses for multiple victims, including family members, friends and a vulnerable child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Campbell has been released on bail and will appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on 17 April 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs Campbell&rsquo;s actions are a betrayal of trust on a massive scale. We allege she used her position to defraud clients out of millions, including vulnerable people and her own friends and family who relied on her for advice, using falsified documents to cover up her lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We are determined to hold her accountable for her actions.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lisa Maureen Campbell was born on 6 January 1970.</li>
<li>This case took 24 months from opening in February 2023 to bringing criminal charges &ndash; compared to an average of 42 months for cases closed in 2023/24. This is an example of how the FCA is improving the pace of its enforcement investigations.</li>
<li>Fraud by abuse of position is an offence under sections 1 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 (6 offences).</li>
<li>Knowingly providing false information in purported compliance with a requirement imposed under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is an offence under section 177 of the same Act.</li>
<li>Campbell &amp; Associates held FCA permissions from 4 October 2013 until 9 February 2023</li>
<li>On 9 February 2023, the FCA issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/restrictions-campbell-associates-independent-financial-advice-ltd" title="Restrictions placed on Campbell &amp; Associates Independent Financial Advice Ltd">First Supervisory Notice</a>&nbsp;to Campbell &amp; Associates, requiring the firm to cease regulated activities, notify customers and platform providers of the restrictions, and retain assets held by the firm.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On 3 April 2023, due to concerns that Mrs Campbell had not complied with restrictions imposed on the firm on 9 February 2023, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/supervisory-notices/first-supervisory-notice-lisa-campbell-campbell-associates-2023.pdf" title="first-supervisory-notice-lisa-campbell-campbell-associates-2023.pdf">imposed conditions</a>&nbsp;preventing Mrs Campbell from performing any activity for which she has approval without the FCA&rsquo;s written consent.</li>
<li>The FCA has been working with Hampshire Police in this investigation, which included Mrs Campbell&rsquo;s arrest and the seizure of evidence.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consumers who believe they may have had funds misappropriated by Campbell &amp; Associates or Lisa Campbell can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/contact" title="Contact us">contact the FCA</a>.</li>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SET partners with</b><b> </b><b>The Institute of Internal Auditors</b><b> </b><b>of</b><b> Thailand to implement new internal audit standards, introducing 'Governance Trinity' - the synergy between AC, CEO, and CAE, while leveraging AI technology to enhance audit efficiency and transparency</b><b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>Reinforces critical roles of boards, executives, and investors in sustainable value creation</b><b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="firstmt-15">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), in collaboration with The Institute of Internal Auditors Thailand, hosted SET Sustainability Forum 1/2025 under the theme "Strengthening Market Resilience Through Audit Excellence" on February 13, 2025. The event brought together the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), governance experts, and listed company executives to share insights on elevating Thai corporate governance in alignment with new internal audit standards, while fostering AC-CEO-CAE collaboration.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>Professor Dr. Pornanong Budsaratragoon, SEC Secretary-General</b>, delivered a special keynote on "Strengthening Market Confidence Through Audit Excellence," emphasizing that strengthening governance and sustainable growth to enhance listed companies' value through robust internal control systems is not merely a compliance issue. Rather, company boards and audit committees should prioritize it as a "tone at the top" and strategic issue to establish adequate and appropriate internal control systems in listed companies.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Dr. Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>highlighted that amid global market volatility, technological disruption, and market dynamics, enhancing governance and internal audit standards is crucial for building investor trust. The collaboration between Audit Committee (AC), Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Chief Audit Executive (CAE) - the 'Governance Trinity' - will drive this transformation.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>Pongsak Sangsingkee, President of The Institute of Internal Auditors of Thailand, introduced</b> the new internal audit standards effective late 2024, developed to align with international benchmarks while considering Thai market context. The standards focus on strengthening AC-CEO-CAE collaboration to enhance corporate governance and sustainable value creation.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15">The forum featured two panel discussions:</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>1)</b> &ldquo;<b>The Governance Trinity: AC, CEO, and CAE Partnership</b><b>&rdquo;</b> joined by IIAT Director Suphamit Techamontrikul; Anuwat Jongyindee, Audit Committee Member, Pruksa Holding pcl; Sakchai Peechapat, Chief Executive Officer, TISCO Financial Group pcl; and Ammaraporn Sivasen, Executive Director, Country Function Head of Internal Audit, United Overseas Bank (Thai) pcl.</p>

<title>ACER Decides Not To Introduce Long-Term Transmission Rights For Hedging Between The Netherlands And Norway</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 16 August 2024, the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of the Netherlands&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPCQJUU1NVVUxaDwZUHVYBVwcdClxQVhoFAAEHVQYAAAUBAlUdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">asked ACER to decide</a>&nbsp;on how to address insufficient risk hedging opportunities at the bidding zone border between the Netherlands and Norway (NL-NO2).</p>
<p>After consulting with stakeholders in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsABVQIUVdcB0xcAQQHHVZdVgUdCl0GVRoFBlIFAQIHBQEHAlQdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">autumn 2024</a>&nbsp;and assessing the potential impact of long-term transmission rights (LTTRs) on this bidding zone border, ACER has now issued its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgdXBVEGAkwKA1VaHVZbVw4dUwsIAhoCXVYCAAQMVFcIBwkdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 02-2025</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why was a decision needed?</span></p>
<p>The Dutch and Norwegian NRAs found insufficient opportunities to hedge electricity prices in their respective bidding zones, which are important for market participants to hedge against price volatility and to mitigate uncertainty on future investment returns.</p>
<p>To address this issue, national regulators can request their Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue LTTRs, which are cross-border hedging tools enabling market players to manage price differences between bidding zones and reduce financial risks; or</li>
<li>Ensure the availability of other long-term cross-zonal hedging products that can support the functioning of the wholesale electricity market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Dutch and Norwegian regulators could not reach an agreement, the decision was referred to ACER and the EFTA Surveillance Authority.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What did ACER decide?</span></p>
<p>ACER decided against the introduction of long-term transmission rights on the NL-NO2 bidding zone border. ACER&rsquo;s assessment showed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTTRs would offer limited improvements to hedging opportunities in the Dutch and NO2 bidding zones;</li>
<li>Financial LTTRs on this border would likely be undervalued, resulting in higher costs for consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, ACER has asked the Dutch TSO to explore alternative measures to address insufficient hedging opportunities in these bidding zones.</p>
<p>The EFTA Surveillance Authority will issue a decision for Norway, following the procedure outlined in the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEUFUIBAVVV0xbV1ZRHVYOAlAdC1oJBxpWUFFTA1UCAAMFAQQdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EEA&nbsp; Agreement</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>The Dutch TSO has six months to submit an alternative hedging proposal to its NRA.</p>

<title>ESMA: Geopolitical And Macroeconomic Developments Driving Market Uncertainty</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA50-524821-3584_TRV_1_2025.pdf">first risk monitoring report of 2025</a>, setting out the key risk drivers currently facing EU financial markets. ESMA finds that overall risks in EU securities markets are high, and market participants should be wary of potential market corrections.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Verena Ross, ESMA&rsquo;s Chair, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;Financial markets remain optimistic, but recent events show that confidence is fragile, including in Europe. The evolution of economic growth, global monetary policy and geopolitics remains uncertain, and this gives rise to key risk drivers.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Market participants need to keep their eyes firmly on growing risks, from possible corrections in surging markets such as cryptos, to the threat of disruption from increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyber-attacks.</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>The difficult funding environment, particularly for equity financing, in Europe identified in the report also shows just how important it is to strengthen European capital markets.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>As global financial markets continue to soar, downside risks are mounting. This is especially visible from an EU perspective where economic and political uncertainties are weighing on markets and where market-based corporate financing remains lacklustre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contagion risk is also set to worsen given surging asset prices in a context of highly interconnected global markets. Crypto markets have recently hit record highs and continue to illustrate the growing risks from social-media-driven investing for investors with limited knowledge. More positively, credit risk should ease as lower interest rates feed through.</p>
<p>ESMA&rsquo;s report provides an update on structural developments and the status of key sectors of financial markets, during the second half of 2024.</p>
<h4><span>Structural developments</span></h4>
<p><span>Market-based finance:</span>&nbsp;The financing of European corporates lost momentum in 2024. The market environment remains challenging, and equity issuance stayed weak overall. Corporate bond issuance fell slightly in 2H24 but remained close to historically high levels. Given the upcoming corporate bond maturity wall from 2025 to 2028, with 47% of debt maturing in this period, debt sustainability remains a risk.</p>
<p><span>Sustainable finance:&nbsp;</span>Uncertainty linked to the direction of global climate policy continued to grow in 2H24. A renewed need to consolidate public finances in advanced economies raised questions on government abilities to finance the transition, while slower ESG investing momentum signalled a drop in appetite for &lsquo;green&rsquo; products. Yet, the strength of the EU green bond market, underpinned by non-financial corporate issuance, suggests a broader greening of the economy continues.</p>
<p><span>Financial innovation:&nbsp;</span>Crypto-asset prices boomed after the US election, with the new administration&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance fuelling market optimism. Bitcoin rose 30% and meme coins, including the largest, Dogecoin, saw their values surge. Total capitalisation of crypto assets rose to EUR&nbsp;3.3tn by end-2024, 27% above the historical peak of November 2021. These events prompted ESMA to renew its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA35-1872330276-1971_Warning_on_crypto-assets.pdf">warning</a>&nbsp;on the highly speculative nature of crypto-assets.</p>
<h4><span>Market monitoring</span></h4>
<p><a><span>Securities markets:&nbsp;</span></a>European equity valuations declined in 4Q24, extending the divergence between EU and US equities. In the EU, considerable disparities in sectoral and country performance persisted.&nbsp;In fixed income markets, corporate bond spreads reached historical lows, especially in the high-yield segment. Search-for-yield behaviour and excessive risk-taking by end investors could lead to pricing misalignments and to abrupt repricing when economic conditions change.</p>
<p><a><span>Asset management:&nbsp;</span></a>In&nbsp;2H24, EU fund asset growth was due to valuation effects, with most categories performing positively amid muted flows. Overall EU equity fund performance outperformed EU indices reflecting a growing exposure to the US. This could expose these funds to higher market risks given signs of overvaluation in US equities. Leverage remains high for hedge funds and commercial real estate fund valuation has not adjusted substantially to underlying prices.</p>
<p><a><span>Consumers:</span></a>&nbsp;Confidence in future market conditions was weak and sentiment in current market conditions reached a two-year low, despite improvements in the aggregate financial position of households. Consumers continued to increase their direct and indirect exposures to bonds amid higher interest rates. Average performance of retail investments also improved in 2024, with positive performance in equity, bond, alternative and mixed funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a><span>Infrastructures and services:&nbsp;</span>Cyber risks continue to grow amid geopolitical tensions. In 2H24, equity-trading volumes remained high (+23% year-on-year). Settlement failure rates decreased, continuing a positive trend observed since the implementation of CSDR in 2022.&nbsp;</a>There was a small decrease in the number of outstanding credit ratings, associated with a decline in financial and&nbsp;particularly covered bond ratings.</p>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-revision-disclosure-framework-private-securitisation">consultation</a>&nbsp;on revising the disclosure framework for private securitisations under the Securitisation Regulation (SECR).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA12-2121844265-4462_-_Consultation_Paper_on_Private_Securitisation.pdf">consultation</a>&nbsp;proposes a simplified disclosure template for private securitisations designed to improve proportionality in information-sharing processes while ensuring that supervisory authorities retain access to the essential data for effective oversight. The new template introduces aggregate-level reporting and streamlined requirements for transaction-specific data, reflecting the operational realities of private securitisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal of the simplified template follows ESMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-securitisation-disclosure-templates">previous consultation</a>, &nbsp;where industry stakeholders called for short-term solutions to address key challenges and advocated for a simplified template for private securitisations. A summary of these responses was published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA12-2121844265-3972_-_Feedback_statement_Securitisation_disclosure_templates.pdf">December 2024 Feedback Statement</a>.</p>
<p>It also adds to the recently announced ESMA initiative on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-contributes-simplification-and-burden-reduction">simplification and burden reduction</a>&nbsp;actions, while preserving the main objectives of financial stability, orderly markets and investor protection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p>ESMA will work closely with the European Commission (EC) to explore whether adjustments to the technical standards, particularly regarding disclosures for private securitisations, can be implemented before the review of the regulation itself.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>
<div class="elementToProof">Duco, the leading enterprise platform for data automation, is pleased to announce that it has joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative &mdash; a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">With this announcement, Duco is proud to join thousands of other companies globally committed to taking responsible business action to create the world we all want.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">During 2024, Duco engaged in a multi-million dollar replatforming to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the firm&rsquo;s energy usage, which enabled it to reduce its hosting emissions by 16% even as the customer base grew by 46%. The firm offset 100% of its emissions from the previous reporting period, invested in nascent technology that permanently removes carbon from the environment, and also switched to 100% renewable energy for its data centres.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The&nbsp;<span><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://unglobalcompact.org/" id="OWA7ed7ecec-3eba-350e-5f42-8db43f0a5fbf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UN Global Compact</a></span>&nbsp;is a call to companies everywhere to align their operations and strategies with&nbsp;<span><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles" id="OWAde935d1e-af04-9c59-56ec-f34da064dfa5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ten universally accepted principles</a></span>&nbsp;in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to take action in support of UN goals and issues embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Launched in 2000, the UN Global Compact is the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world, with more than 15,000 companies and 3,800 non-business signatories based in over 160 countries, and more than 69 Local Networks.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Danielle Price, CFO and Head of Sustainability, Duco</b>, said: &ldquo;As a private company, we&rsquo;re not obligated to report on ESG matters, but we take our role in society very seriously and we&rsquo;re committed to making a positive impact on our environment and communities. This is true across the organisation, from our exec team through to our passionate engineers who are constantly making improvements to our platform, reducing our impact on the environment. Joining the Compact marks the latest in a series of commitments we&rsquo;re making to do our part in creating a fair, equitable and sustainable world.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&ldquo;Those actions have a broader impact, as through our products, we help banks and other organisations collectively reduce carbon emissions by utilising greener technology. We were able to demonstrate a reduction of emissions in the region of 60-80% on a reconciliation use case for our existing customers moving to public cloud following our multi-million dollar investment. That&rsquo;s a significant global environmental impact if you consider how many firms still operate on on-premise software. If we&rsquo;re serious about making a difference to the environment, the choice has to be solutions in the cloud with a passion for sustainability in their DNA.&rdquo;</div>

<p><span><span>Global deal activity (mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A), private equity (PE) and venture financing) experienced an 8.4% decline year-on-year (YoY) in January 2025 with decrease in deal volume observed across all the regions.

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The decline in deal activity across all the regions reflects the current challenges and uncertainties.

<p><span><span>On the other hand, the total number of deals announced in North America, Middle East and Africa, and South and Central American regions were down by 1.9%, 5.5% and 23.8%, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Among the select key markets, China, the UK, Canada, South Korea, France and Australia experienced YoY decline in their deal volume by 30.4%, 20.5%, 18.9%, 28.3%, 16.7% and 17.3% respectively, while markets such as India, Japan, and Germany showed improvement in deal activity by 27.3%, 35% and 8.2%, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile the trend remained a mixed bag across the different deal types under coverage. Venture financing deals volume saw YoY decline of 9.4% during January 2025 while the number of M&amp;A deals fell by 8.6%. However, private equity deals experienced improvement in volume by 4.5% during the review period.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;The data reveals a challenging landscape for global deal activity, with a broad decline in deal volumes, particularly in certain key markets. In this shifting environment, it will be crucial for investors to stay vigilant, closely monitor these trends, and adjust their strategies to effectively navigate the evolving market dynamics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak today about stablecoins, an important innovation for the crypto ecosystem with the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;A little over three years ago, I outlined my views on the benefits and risks of stablecoins.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I can think of no better place than this conference to discuss the maturing stablecoin market and examine potential challenges that could impede stablecoins from reaching their full potential.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this speech, I define stablecoins as a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national currency and backed at least one-to-one with safe and liquid assets. Specifically, a pool of assets is held in reserve so that stablecoins can be redeemed for traditional currency in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Stablecoins&mdash;as with any means of payment&mdash;must demonstrate 1) a clear&nbsp;<em>use case</em>&nbsp;and 2) a clear&nbsp;<em>commercial case&nbsp;</em>to be economically viable. These terms are often conflated, but they are different, and both are necessary. Having a use case is how you attract consumers and businesses, while a business model is necessary for issuers of stablecoins to continue operating. As private sector innovators look to expand on the use cases of stablecoins and seek to achieve scale, what might emerge as challenges or roadblocks? This is a question I will explore today, including from a public sector perspective. Of course, as a policymaker, I am not here to endorse any of these use cases or business models, and what follows is not advice or recommendations. Rather, I am discussing them to underscore the varied ecosystem that policymakers must understand.</p>
<p>I will begin by explaining some of the use cases of stablecoins, including those that are well established and those that are still emerging. The primary use of stablecoins is as a safe crypto store of value. In the early days of crypto trading, buying and selling crypto meant trading one crypto-asset for another crypto-asset. As we have seen, crypto prices can fluctuate substantially, which means crypto-assets that are not anchored as stablecoins suffer from price risk. All financial markets crave the existence of a safe, low-risk asset which allows traders to move out of risky positions into safe ones where the safe asset price is known and stable. The beauty of financial innovation is that if a market demands such an asset, someone will figure out how to supply it. Thus, stablecoins were born.</p>
<p>A stablecoin's value is tied to a national fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar being the fiat currency of choice for most stablecoins. In this sense, stablecoins are synthetic dollars. In our everyday life, the dollar serves as a medium of exchange and a unit of account. By their tie to the dollar, stablecoins are the medium of exchange and unit of account in the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>But how does one trade a "real" dollar for a "synthetic" dollar, like a stablecoin? Exchanges already allowed agents to move in and out of the crypto ecosystem but doing so took time and money. Stablecoins provided a marketplace solution to this problem&mdash;a means to represent dollars on exchanges so that transactions could be carried out more quickly and efficiently. Currently, stablecoins are involved in over 80 percent of trading volume on major centralized crypto exchanges.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>A second stablecoin use case is providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars. Today, around 99 percent of stablecoin market capitalization is denominated in U.S. dollars, and the vast majority of digital asset trades are priced in U.S. dollars.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;This is no surprise given the primacy of the U.S. dollar in global finance and trade, and I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services.</p>
<p>A third use case is cross-border payments. For example, we are hearing increased industry focus on the "stablecoin sandwich" model of cross-border payments, in which fiat currency in one country is converted first into a U.S. dollar stablecoin, then that stablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then finally the stablecoin is converted back into the local fiat currency at its destination. This has the potential to reduce the complexity of a series of correspondent banking networks, improving transparency, cost, and timeliness. As this use case develops, it is critical that market participants implement all anti-money laundering and relevant consumer safeguards.</p>
<p>The last use case I will describe is in retail payments. At present, stablecoin use for retail payments is very limited. However, I am seeing a lot of new, private sector entrants looking to find ways to support the use of stablecoins for retail payments. For example, firms that provide point-of-sale technology are acquiring innovative fintechs or developing their own capabilities to accept stablecoins for retail purchases. This provides consumers with yet another option. Firms are also looking to incorporate stablecoins&mdash;and crypto more broadly&mdash;into peer-to-peer payment apps.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether stablecoins will scale for retail payment use cases. Such an evolution would require both a substantial number of consumers to shift their preferences toward using stablecoins and a significant number of businesses to make necessary investments to receive payments via stablecoins. We know that consumer retail payments behavior is sticky, and when behavior does change, it generally happens over a long period. If retail payments use cases do increase, it would probably take years to have a significant impact. That said, if stablecoins reduce transaction fees or allow merchants to attract customers, then merchants could have an incentive to accept them. Ultimately, the market will sort out whether consumers and businesses have the incentives to use stablecoins in this way.</p>
<p>In addition to stablecoins having clear cut use cases, issuers must have a viable business model. To cite one famous example, Red Lobster's endless shrimp deal was popular with customers, but it did not turn out to be a sustainable model for the restaurant chain. Let me describe what I think are the incentives for stablecoin issuers, but I am here today to learn more.</p>
<p>To date, most stablecoin issuers appear to generate revenue primarily by earning higher returns on their reserve assets than they incur in expenses. They issue a zero-interest liability and use the proceeds to acquire interest earning assets, thereby profiting from the spread. As with bank deposits, the interest rate environment will have a significant effect on the profitability of firms issuing stablecoins. Higher interest rates generally mean higher rates of return on reserve assets, which generates revenue for the issuer. However, higher interest rates also have the potential to make non-interest bearing assets less attractive for consumers to hold. That said, users who hold stablecoins as an accessible, safe store of U.S. dollar denominated value may not be particularly sensitive to the interest rate environment, a phenomenon we already see today with some holders of physical U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>An additional way stablecoin issuers can generate revenue is through fees. This could include charging minting and burning fees, which occur when a customer acquires a new stablecoin for a real dollar or wants to redeem it for real dollars. This is very much like the foreign exchange market in fiat currencies that most of us are familiar with. Alternatively, as occurs with most payments firms, the issuer could earn money from transaction fees.</p>
<p>Finally, stablecoin issuers may use stablecoins as part of a broader strategy to attract customers to whom they may sell other products and services. In that case, stablecoins could be seen as a "loss leader" to entice customers to use other products or services offered by the stablecoin issuer that are much more profitable.</p>
<p>With the exception of the last example, the viability of the other business models will depend on the ability of stablecoins to scale as a means of payment and on how consumers and businesses respond. For example, if the stablecoin issuer decides to pass through interest earnings on its assets, that will make the stablecoin more attractive, but it will reduce the profits from issuing a stablecoin. The smaller the interest rate spread, the more important scale becomes. For the fee-based models, free entry into this space will drive down fees as it does in any other market, which will reduce the revenue from issuing a stablecoin.</p>
<p>Within this market, scale is important for achieving certain use cases as well as satisfying certain business models. For example, stablecoins are unlikely to become a viable option for retail payments if consumers question whether stablecoins will be widely accepted as a means of payment, while stablecoin issuers cannot generate significant revenue from interest on backing assets or fees without scale. I call this the "Field of Dreams" problem&mdash;if you build it, will they come?</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, let's now dive into some of the potential challenges or roadblocks that will need to be overcome for stablecoins to achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>The first theme I will explore is one that I have discussed in the past&mdash;the safety and soundness of stablecoins and the need for a clear regulatory regime for stablecoins in the United States.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Stablecoins are forms of private money and, like any form of private money, are subject to run risk, and we have seen "depegs" of some stablecoins in recent years. Additionally, all payment systems face risk of failure, and stablecoins are subject to clearing, settlement, and other payment system risks as well. At the same time, it is important to note that the risks faced by stablecoin issuers are not the same risks faced by banks. The stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework that addresses stablecoin risks directly, fully, and narrowly. This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape, including competing payment instruments.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that I think it is important that U.S. legislation makes provision for the supervision and regulation of stablecoin issuers that is proportionate to the risks they pose, without stifling their innovative potential while the marketplace is still developing. I believe in the power of the private sector to develop solutions that benefit businesses and consumers, with the job of the public sector to create a fair set of rules for market participants to operate within, including guardrails that ensure safety for consumers and the financial system as a whole. Having a level of certainty is important for businesses looking to invest in new products and services as well as for consumer confidence and assurance.</p>
<p>Fragmentation is the next theme I'll explore, first from a technical perspective. Currently, several popular blockchain networks are designed as distinct from one another. Firms looking to scale across blockchains are seeking technical solutions to achieve cross-chain interoperability. Will this ultimately prove efficient, especially in a world with multiple stablecoin providers operating within potentially different combinations of blockchain networks? Or will there be multiple, competing ecosystems, for example where one stablecoin dominates on certain blockchains, and another stablecoin dominates on others? Alternatively, a stablecoin market featuring a high degree of interoperability could support a variety of stablecoin issuers and blockchain networks, providing consumers a choice in stablecoins and technologies. It is not yet clear how these dynamics will ultimately impact business models and use cases for stablecoins, but it is an issue that bears watching as firms work to scale and mature their businesses.</p>
<p>Fragmentation around the use and acceptance of stablecoins will also act as an impediment to scaling and will impact how stablecoin use cases develop. As I noted, stablecoins will prove useful as a means of payment insofar as holders of a specific stablecoin expect that others will accept them. The more people will accept a stablecoin, the more convenient a stablecoin will be. For the retail payment use case, how easy will it be for me as a consumer to pay with stablecoins at the point of sale, either in-person or online? From the merchant perspective, what incentives will firms have to accept stablecoins? Similarly, for cross-border payments, how widely will different firms (and their banking partners) transact in stablecoins? And, more broadly, could stablecoins have the potential to recreate and potentially exacerbate the current challenges associated with correspondent banking, further fragmenting the marketplace? Or could stablecoins mature in such a way to change the market structure of cross-border payments?</p>
<p>Fragmentation in regulation also has the potential to hold stablecoins back from reaching their full potential. As I already discussed, the stablecoin market does not have a clear regulatory framework in the United States. While there have been efforts to develop some international standards, the emergence of different global stablecoin regulatory regimes creates the potential for conflicting regulation domestically and internationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This regulatory fragmentation could make it difficult for U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers to operate at a global scale. And as I have noted, scale is vital for any means of payment to achieve its full potential.</p>
<p>For example, under Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, stablecoin issuers can earn interest on their reserve assets as a business model, whereas other regulatory models being discussed would require reserves for stablecoins deemed systemically important to be held as non-interest-bearing central bank deposits, limiting stablecoin issuers into a specific business model. Domestically, state regulators have been key players in the development of the stablecoin market, and several states are in the process of developing state laws or finalizing new regulations related to stablecoin issuance. There is a risk that state regulations may conflict, which could prevent the use of the same stablecoin across all states and reduce stablecoin scalability. As with the United States' dual banking system, a complementary framework with state and federal regulators working together can allow innovation to flourish while achieving some of the benefits of scale that come with a harmonized set of market rules.</p>
<p>Different regulatory regimes are also creating separate reserve asset and redemption requirements for stablecoin issuers&mdash;a further potential regulatory regime fragmentation. In Europe, non-systemic stablecoin issuers are required to hold a minimum of 30 percent of their backing assets in bank deposits, and regulators have further proposed concentration limits per bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This differs from the requirements of some U.S. state-regulated issuers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;To operate at a global scale, stablecoin issuers would therefore have to issue the same stablecoin under multiple regimes with separate reserve asset and redemption requirements. Will this be efficient and ultimately prove workable if the number of regulatory regimes domestically and internationally continue to grow? Will we expect a stablecoin issuer to rebalance its reserves when a stablecoin is transferred between users in different countries or U.S. states? Creating consistency at the federal level could allow federal authorities to negotiate with foreign counterparts to ensure global regulations serve the interests of U.S. consumers and businesses and allow the U.S. to be a regulation setter for an asset class primarily denominated in our national unit of account.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my hope is that the stablecoin market will grow or diminish on the merits of their benefits to consumers and the broader economy. For the private sector, that means continuing to develop innovative solutions that fit a market need while building sustainable business models. And for the public sector, it means setting clear and targeted legal and regulatory frameworks and coordinating those frameworks across states and national boundaries to enable private sector innovation at a global scale.</p>

<title>Statement On Staff Legal Bulletin 14M, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Feb. 12, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-crenshaw-fe-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-crenshaw-fe-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, under the direction of the Acting Chairman, Staff Legal Bulletin 14L is now rescinded by the issuance of Staff Legal Bulletin 14M (&ldquo;SLB 14M&rdquo;). SLB 14M moves the goalposts smack dab in the middle of this year&rsquo;s shareholder proposal process. Doing so at this hour creates undue costs and uncertainty for investors and corporations alike. This type of political policy shifting mid-season serves to undercut capital formation, not facilitate it.</p>
<p>SLB 14M implements different rules of the road for the process of excluding shareholder proposals from issuers&rsquo; proxy statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Such proposals include topics relating to poison pills, compensation, emerging issues such as AI, political and lobbying expenditures, and environmental or other issues that shareholders have identified as materially impacting the firm&rsquo;s financial value.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The fact that the change is taking place at this time is significant. As anyone familiar with the shareholder proposal process knows, excluding a proposal from the proxy statement all but guarantees it will never make it to a shareholder vote.</p>
<p>The rescission comes as no surprise given that the shareholder proposal process has become the target of politicized messaging and a preferred punching bag of those who wish to diminish corporate democracy. This is the case even though there are already numerous other mechanisms in place to limit the availability of the proxy ballot to shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Though the shareholder proposal process is designed merely to facilitate a dialogue with investors, today&rsquo;s actions drowns out investor voices and facilitates corporate monologues instead.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Even though the rescission may not be a surprise, the timing of this action is arbitrary and inequitable. Shareholders have already crafted and submitted their proposals for this season. Corporations and shareholders will incur costs to supplement or alter no-action requests and responses. Further, SEC staff have already issued no-action letter responses related to proposals for this proxy season. Even for those stakeholders and observers who prefer a different approach to this process, the end result is quite possibly disparate treatment not just for shareholders, but for issuers as well. We are so focused on undoing the prior Commission&rsquo;s agenda that we sow chaos now. By choosing this path, we forsake all consistency, and perhaps even the legitimacy, of the independent, historically staff-governed process to the detriment of all parties.</p>
<p>While costly and confusing, corporations will still have a chance to revise their no-action requests to exclude proposals. Shareholders, of course, will have no such opportunity. The 14a-8 no-action process is fact-intensive, and exactly how a proposal is crafted is often determinative of its exclusion or inclusion. It is now too late for most shareholders to design proposals in line with SLB 14M.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a measured approach that would ensure market stability and a meaningful consideration of cost and benefit, this leadership has rushed out staff guidance for the sake of political expediency, and at significant cost to shareholders, corporations, and SEC staff resources.</p>

<title>ISDA Annual Legal Forum, February 12, 2025, Opening Remarks, Katherine Tew Darras, ISDA General Counsel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and welcome to the Annual Legal Forum in London. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you to Cleary Gottlieb for sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, 2025 is an important year for ISDA as we mark our 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary. In 1985, a small group of dealers established ISDA, then called the International Swap Dealers Association, to develop standards for the nascent interest rate swaps market, which had become bogged down by a lack of standard terms and a growing documentation backlog.</p>
<p>Forty years on, much has changed. We started out with 10 dealers, mainly based in New York. Today, we have more than 1,000 members in 76 countries, with end users making up the largest part of the membership. ISDA&rsquo;s very first document, published in 1985, was the Code of Standard Wording, Assumptions and Provisions for Swaps, which essentially provided a dictionary of common terms that parties could use in their contracts. Today, ISDA&rsquo;s suite of industry documentation reaches far and wide, with more than 160 documents and document versions now available in digital form on ISDA MyLibrary.</p>
<p>But some things have remained unchanged. What was groundbreaking in 1985 was the willingness of market participants to sit around a table and work together to address shared challenges. With a growing backlog of bespoke documentation, standardization was desperately needed to bring greater efficiency and enable the market to scale. Forty years later, ISDA is many times bigger and the challenges are different, but collaboration, standardization and the development of industry solutions remain at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I&rsquo;ll talk about several areas where we&rsquo;re currently collaborating with our membership to bring greater efficiency and standardization to derivatives documentation and vital processes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with document digitization.</p>
<p>I mentioned ISDA MyLibrary a moment ago, which is an online hub that houses core ISDA documentation in digital form. But ISDA&rsquo;s commitment to digitization doesn&rsquo;t just apply to the documents themselves. ISDA Create, which is available through S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform, enables firms to digitally generate and execute documentation and then seamlessly capture, process and store the data from those negotiations. This improves speed and efficiency, enabling firms to accelerate the onboarding of new counterparties. More than 500 buy- and sell-side entities around the world are now experiencing the benefits of ISDA Create.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not standing still. Following extensive development and testing, we&rsquo;re now working with Linklaters to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) to ISDA Create, unlocking powerful new efficiencies for those users that feel ready for it.</p>
<p>The first new feature is CiQ Extract, which allows agreements to be negotiated offline and then seamlessly re-uploaded and mapped back onto the platform. This is a big step forward because it supports those counterparties that might prefer to negotiate their contracts in the traditional way, while still enabling those documents, and the data within them, to be captured on ISDA Create. Using AI, we can bridge the gap between offline negotiations and digital continuity, mapping the extracted data back to the original digital template and maintaining a single repository for contract negotiations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing AI to summarize the lengthy comment chains that can appear as documents are negotiated on ISDA Create. Firms will be encouraged to review the output themselves, but the ability to have comments summarized by a machine opens the door to even greater speed and efficiency when using ISDA Create. We are demonstrating this feature outside at the ISDA Create booth, so please do take a look.</p>
<p>As we continue to unlock improvements in documentation, we&rsquo;re also collaborating with members to address bottlenecks in other industry processes. One such area is the physical delivery and receipt of critical notices, a key step in the process of terminating a counterparty relationship.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, termination-related notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods using the counterparty&rsquo;s address as listed in the agreement. This has long been problematic if a counterparty has moved offices without updating the address details in the documentation. But more recent issues emerged during the pandemic lockdowns, making it extremely difficult to deliver or receive notices because offices were closed.</p>
<p>This is a serious issue with economic consequences. Delays and uncertainty over the delivery of notices can lead to losses running to millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The good news is that we&rsquo;re moving forward at pace with the development of the ISDA Notices Hub, an online platform that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of notices from anywhere in the world. It will also maintain a golden source of updated address details for those counterparty relationships where physical delivery of notices will continue.</p>
<p>Last year, ISDA undertook an industry outreach exercise that showed strong support for this initiative from buy- and sell-side institutions globally. Use of the Notices Hub will be free for the buy side and we&rsquo;re also developing a protocol that will incorporate delivery of notices in this way as an acceptable option into existing agreements. This protocol will be free of charge to everyone. Like ISDA Create, the Notices Hub will be available on Counterparty Manager, which means firms will be able to access a wide range of functionality, including the negotiation of documents and the delivery and receipt of notices. This creates a full ecosystem for client onboarding, documentation and integral data points.</p>
<p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;ll briefly bring you up to date on the review of ISDA&rsquo;s 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions.</p>
<p>This project got underway last year in response to industry feedback on the need to update the definitions to reflect the nature of today&rsquo;s FX market. This is a market that trades around the clock and across the world, and it has grown from an average daily turnover of $1.5 trillion in 1998 to $7.5 trillion in 2022.</p>
<p>While the contractual terms applicable to FX derivatives have evolved with the addition of supplemental publications over the years, we found strong industry support for a review and consolidation of the definitions. In particular, there was widespread demand to revisit the provisions relating to disruption events and fallbacks to create greater certainty in the event of future geopolitical shocks. We&rsquo;re also taking a close look at other aspects of the definitions, including the treatment of unexpected holidays that may be announced after the forward price has been set.</p>
<p>The review of the FX definitions is now well advanced and we expect to complete the drafting later this year, with implementation targeted for the end of 2027.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked in these remarks about three areas where ISDA is working with members to bring improvements to vital industry documents and processes. It&rsquo;s a set of issues that the pioneers of ISDA would never have imagined when they first convened in the 1980s. But I think they&rsquo;d recognize the same spirit of collaboration and quest for mutualized solutions that drove the development of the very first ISDA documentation. The issues change, the challenges evolve, but the process endures.</p>
<p>In ISDA&rsquo;s 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, it&rsquo;s my great pleasure to welcome you to this flagship event. We have a great set of panels and presentations lined up, and I hope you find them engaging and insightful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Its Final Draft Technical Standards To Implement A Centralised EBA Pillar 3 Data Hub</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the Pillar 3 data hub for large and other institutions, which will centralise prudential disclosures by institutions through a single electronic access point on the EBA website. This project is part of the Banking Package laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6).</span></p>
<p>The ITS detail the IT solutions and processes to be followed by large and other institutions when submitting their respective Pillar 3 disclosures. This includes the IT solutions to be used, the data exchange formats to be considered and the technical validations to be performed by the EBA. The EBA will provide additional detailed information to the submitters of Pillar 3 information in the onboarding communication plan it expects to publish by the end of the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>To submit the information to the EBA, institutions will benefit from a transition period for the information with disclosure reference dates from June to December 2025. This will give them enough time to prepare for the new publication process.</p>
<p>In parallel, the EBA finalised a pilot exercise on a voluntary basis to test the process for large and other institutions. When finalising the draft ITS, the EBA has taken on board the conclusions from this pilot exercise, together with the feedback received during the&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-consults-draft-technical-standards-support-centralised-eba-pillar-3-data-hub">consultation</a>&nbsp;phase.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis, backgrounds and next steps</span></p>
<p>The new Banking Package (CRR3/CRD6), which will implement the latest Basel III reforms in the EU, includes a mandate to the EBA to develop a Pillar 3 data hub. The EBA&rsquo;s plan on how to implement the mandates included in the Banking Package is explained in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package">'EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework'</a>, published in December 2023.</p>
<p>The CRR3 (Articles 434 and 434a) mandates the EBA to publish on its website the prudential disclosures for all institutions subject to such requirements, making it readily available in a centralised manner to all the relevant stakeholders through a single electronic access point on its website. To comply with this mandate, the EBA is building a data hub putting together all the disclosures required under Part Eight of the CRR.</p>
<p>The draft ITS for small and non-complex institutions and on the resubmission policy will be subject to a separate consultation, intended to be launched in the first half of 2025.</p>

<title>KDPW: New Website And LEI Issuance Application</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/kdpw-new-website-and-lei-issuance-application-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/kdpw-new-website-and-lei-issuance-application-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>As of 10 February 2025, KDPW has launched a new website and LEI issuance application, available at the same address as before:&nbsp;</b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lei.kdpw.pl/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b></b></a><b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lei.kdpw.pl/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.lei.kdpw.pl/</a></b><b>. The project developed an additional API module to ensure communication between the online application and the IT system.</b></p>
<p>The modifications made to the electronic LEI request make the process of getting an LEI much shorter. The LEI request has also been largely simplified.</p>
<p>The new website features an LEI database where users can easily check the expiry date of the LEI; a search engine to find the LEI of any company and access high-quality data assigned to the LEI; information on discounts available for multi-year payments; and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>Logged-in clients can request a new LEI; download free of charge a certificate confirming the registration of the LEI; download an invoice; update the company details assigned to the LEI; and renew the LEI.</p>
<p>LEIs are issued for a specific period of time and must be renewed. LEIs are issued by Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF). KDPW is the only Polish entity authorised to issue LEIs. KDPW issues LEIs for entities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the UK.</p>
<p>Currently KDPW manages a database of 33,700 LEIs.</p>
<p>The LEI (Legal Entity Identifier) is a 20-character alpha-numeric globally unique legal entity identifier compliant with ISO17442. Each LEI is linked to key information about the legal entity that holds the LEI, which enables the identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions worldwide.</p>
<p>LEIs are mandatory for entities active in the financial markets, including banks, credit institutions, brokers, financial intermediaries, pension funds, investment funds, as well as non-financial entities, such as companies, individuals who carry out business activities in all areas of the economy, and local governments.</p>

our ability to continue introducing innovative and competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis, including through our electronic trading capabilities, and derive revenues that are commensurate with our efforts and expectations, our ability to maintain the competitiveness of our existing products and services; our ability to adjust our fixed costs and expenses if our revenues decline; our ability to manage variable costs relating to&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;transition to the&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud and&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud platform and minimize duplicative costs during the transition between maintaining the on-premise environment and the&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud environment; our ability to maintain existing customers at substantially similar trading levels, develop strategic relationships and attract new customers; our ability to expand and globally offer our products and services; changes in regulations, including the impact of any changes in laws or government policies with respect to our products or services or our industry, such as any changes to regulations and policies that require increased financial and operational resources from us or our customers, as well as the impact of tariffs and tax policy changes, restrictions on our ability to offer&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;products and services in specific geographies or to specific customers or limitations or changes in underlying/physical product flows across geographies; the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights and our ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others; decreases in revenue from our market data as a result of decreased demand or changes to regulations in various jurisdictions; changes in our rate per contract due to shifts in the mix of the products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure; the ability of our credit and liquidity risk management practices to adequately protect us from the credit risks of clearing members and other counterparties, and to satisfy the margin and liquidity requirements associated with the BrokerTec matched principal business; the ability of our compliance and risk management programs to effectively monitor and manage our risks, including our ability to prevent errors and misconduct and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets; our dependence on third-party providers and exposure to risk through third parties, including risks related to the performance, reliability and security of technology used by our&nbsp;</i><i>third-party providers and third party providers that our clients and third-parties rely on; our reliance on third-party distribution partners, including independent software vendors (ISVs), Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs), introducing brokers, broker-dealers around the world, regulatory reporting and data distributors and platform operators, and other partners, for facilitating trading and for market data information, and potential impacts from changes in their business models and priorities; volatility in commodity, equity and fixed income prices, and price volatility of financial benchmarks and instruments such as interest rates, equity indices, fixed income instruments&nbsp;</i><i>and foreign exchange rates; economic, social, political and market conditions, including the volatility of the capital&nbsp;</i><i>and credit markets and the impact of economic conditions on the trading activity of our current and potential customers; our ability to accommodate increases in contract volume and market data and order transaction traffic across the entire trade cycle and the ability to implement enhancements without failure or degradation of the</i>&nbsp;<i>performance of our trading and clearing systems and meeting our regulatory reporting obligations; our ability to execute our growth strategy and maintain our growth effectively; our ability to manage the risks, control the costs and achieve the synergies associated with our strategy for acquisitions, investments and alliances, including those associated with the performance of our joint ventures with S&amp;P Dow Jones (S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LL) in index services, our primary business and distribution partners' actions and our partnership with&nbsp;Google, including our ability to manage the successful implementation of our agreements with&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud and our data center partners; variances in earnings on cash accounts and collateral that our clearing house holds for its clients; impact of&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;pricing/fee level and structure and incentive changes; impact of aggregation services and internalization on trade flow and volumes; any negative financial impacts from changes to the terms of intellectual property and index rights; our ability to continue to generate funds and/or manage our indebtedness to allow us to continue to invest in our business; industry, channel partner and customer consolidation and/or concentration; decreases in trading and clearing activity; the imposition of a transaction tax or user fee on futures and options transactions and/or repeal of the 60/40 tax treatment of such transactions; increases in effective tax rates, borrowing costs, or changes in tax policy; our ability to maintain our brand and reputation; and the unfavorable resolution of material legal proceedings. For a detailed discussion and additional information concerning these and other factors that might affect our performance, see our other recent periodic filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended&nbsp;December 31, 2023&nbsp;as filed with the&nbsp;Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;("SEC") on&nbsp;February 28, 2024, under the caption "Risk Factors."</i></p>

<title>FIA Tech’s Trade Data Network Now Supports Real Time T+0 Fees And Commissions Matching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FIA Tech, a leading technology provider in the futures industry, today announced that its Trade Data Network is now live with real time fee and commission matching, reconciliation and resolution, allowing the buyside complete transparency into one of the biggest sources of operational frustration for the exchange traded derivatives industry.</p>
<p>This marks the go-live of the second phase of FIA Tech&rsquo;s initiative to improve fees and commission related operational issues for the buyside, following the launch of FIA Tech&rsquo;s Fee and Commission Repository which brought the central storage of golden source information on exchange and clearing fees, commissions and regulatory fees.</p>
<p>Fee and Commission breaks are by far the largest source of matching breaks in the ETD market and including them in TDN&rsquo;s matching capabilities gives clients the ability to match in real time, depending on the capabilities of their brokers. Currently, managing these breaks takes up the bulk of ETD operations teams&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Nick Solinger, President and CEO of FIA Tech, said: &ldquo;93% of buyside firms in our recent industry survey stated T+0 processing gaps are driving significant operational costs and risks.&nbsp; It remains far too challenging for the ETD industry to manage the complexity of exchange fees, commissions, brokerage and regulatory fees across 80+ global exchanges. TDN is the first post-trade solution bringing all the golden source data on Brokerage, Fees and Commissions together in real-time from all participants - the clients, clearing firms, brokers and exchanges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ETD market has long struggled with a lack of transparency and high volumes of varied and inconsistent data, with multiple sources, formats, timings, and standards. This hampers the accurate exchange of data and requires manual processes and duplicative reconciliations, making communication between participants slow and costly. TDN was created to integrate disparate post-trade ETD data in real time from multiple sources, including executing brokers, CCPs, clearing brokers and clients, and offer matching services to create a single trade lineage in a common, secure, standards-based ledger.</p>
<p>Funded by the market, TDN is already supported by over 20 banks/brokers and 40 investment managers/hedge funds with a total AUM of $34 trillion. It has a comprehensive coverage of all exchanges and CCPs, with support of clearing and executing firms representing over 80% of the global futures volumes. TDN is one of the only global trade ledger initiatives to gain widespread adoption and production deployment at scale, processing millions of transactions in real time each day.</p>

<title>SIX Launches New Service To Transform Crypto Collateral Management</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-service-to-transform-crypto-collateral-management-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-service-to-transform-crypto-collateral-management-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX launched the new Digital Collateral Service (DCS) today, permitting financial institutions to post selected cryptocurrency assets as collateral alongside traditional collateral.</span></p>
<p>The new product offers a solution through which clients can manage traditional securities and cryptocurrency collateral. Firms managing both bonds and bitcoin, for example, can now post both as collateral to cover a single exposure. This will simplify operations for traders and their counterparts significantly, enhancing portfolio management efficiency and minimizing counterparty risk. SIX has developed this service by combining and leveraging expertise from different areas in its international custody business and SDX.</p>
<p>Beyond providing a more seamless and holistic collateral management platform, DCS leverages the crypto custody infrastructure of SDX, delivering users enhanced safeguarding mechanisms. The default protection for collateral held in this type of account structure adds a layer of security that many institutional investors have been seeking to justify greater participation in institutional cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the new offering,&nbsp;<span>David Newns, Head SDX</span>, said: &ldquo;The role of cryptocurrencies in collateral management will become increasingly important. Our new and fully integrated solution empowers product issuers, traders, brokers, and market makers to optimize their collateral usage, whether it&rsquo;s crypto or traditional securities, with built-in risk management safeguards. This allows financial institutions to embrace crypto collateral on a larger scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Christian Geiger, Head Clients &amp; Products Securities Finance, SIX</span>, added: &ldquo;Building on our role as a trusted financial market infrastructure and leveraging the flexibility of our state-of-the-art Triparty Agent, we are thrilled to expand our offerings to include cryptocurrencies as a new asset class for collateralization. With the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, we are committed to meeting the needs of this highly risk-conscious investor segment through our established and reliable services.&rdquo;</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="prof-standards"></a>Professional standards and assessment of qualifications</h2>
<p>Since 1 January 2019, certain&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/" title="Professional standards for financial advisers">professional standards</a>&nbsp;have applied to relevant providers (i.e. advisers who are authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products) and to provisional relevant providers (i.e. individuals in the third or fourth quarter of their professional year).</p>
<p>Among other things, relevant providers and provisional relevant providers must comply with the &lsquo;qualifications standard&rsquo; in section 921B(2) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001&nbsp;</em>(Corporations Act). Relevant providers who are existing providers have until 1 January 2026 to meet the qualifications standard.</p>
<p>In response to feedback from industry, ASIC has developed additional guidance for assessing an individual&rsquo;s qualifications and training against the qualifications standard.</p>
<p>We created worked examples to show how an AFS licensee should assess and input the qualifications of their relevant providers into the financial advisers register: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/#examples" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Example qualification assessments</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website.</p>
<p>The webinar hosted by ASIC in November 2024 also provides a practical walkthrough of how to assess a person&rsquo;s qualifications against the requirements, and how to input qualifications information into the financial advisers register. See&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/asic-webinar-on-assessing-relevant-provider-qualifications/" title="ASIC webinar on assessing relevant provider qualifications">ASIC webinar on assessing relevant provider qualifications</a>&nbsp;for a recording, slides and consolidated list of answers to questions asked during the webinar.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="exp-prov"></a>Experienced provider pathway</h2>
<p>Financial advisers must meet&nbsp;<strong>both</strong>&nbsp;of the following criteria to be eligible to rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard in section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act and the professional year standard in section 921B(4) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>First, they must meet the definition of &lsquo;experienced provider&rsquo; in section 1684 of the Corporations Act. Specifically, they must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>been a relevant provider for at least 10 years (that is, 3,650 days &ndash; whether consecutive or not) during the period 1&nbsp;January 2007 to 31&nbsp;December 2021, and</li>
<li>had a clean disciplinary record as at 31 December 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, if they are an existing provider and did not pass the financial adviser exam by the exam cut-off day that applies to them (1&nbsp;January 2022, or 1&nbsp;October 2022 if they qualified for the exam extension), their authorisation to provide personal advice must have ceased before their exam cut-off day. That is, they must not have been authorised to provide personal advice on their exam cut-off day.</p>
<p>Financial advisers who meet both of the above criteria and wish to rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard and the professional year standard must make a written declaration confirming that they satisfy the definition of &lsquo;experienced provider&rsquo;. They must then give a copy of their declaration to their authorising AFS licensee(s) as soon as practicable after making the declaration. If the financial adviser is eligible to access the pathway, the AFS licensee(s) must notify ASIC that the licensee has received a copy of a written declaration within 30 business days after the day the declaration was given to them.</p>
<p>To meet the 10 years experience requirement, a financial adviser must demonstrate that they were authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients on relevant financial products for at least 10 years during the relevant period. Other authorisations (for example, an authorisation covering general advice only) do not count towards the 10 years experience requirement.</p>
<p>Existing providers who plan to rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard should make a written declaration before&nbsp;<strong>1&nbsp;January 2026</strong>&nbsp;so that they can continue to be authorised and registered to provide personal advice from this date.</p>
<p>For more information on the experienced provider pathway, see Information Sheet 281&nbsp;<em>FAQs: Relevant providers &ndash; Accessing the experienced provider pathway&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/faqs-relevant-providers-accessing-the-experienced-provider-pathway/">INFO 281</a>).</p>
<h2><a id="review-comp"></a>Review of compliance with professional standards and professional year programs</h2>
<p>ASIC recently reviewed a sample of records retained by AFS licensees in relation to their assessment of the professional standards for financial advisers. We also reviewed a sample of AFS licensee professional year programs.</p>

<h2><a id="first-internal"></a>First internal dispute resolution data report and findings</h2>
<p>In December 2024, ASIC released Report 801&nbsp;<em>Insights from internal dispute resolution data reporting: July 2023 to June 2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-801-insights-from-internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting-july-2023-to-june-2024/" title="REP 801 Insights from internal dispute resolution data reporting: July 2023 to June 2024">REP 801</a>) &ndash; the first publication of industry-wide data under the internal dispute resolution (IDR) data reporting framework: see also Media Release (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-264mr-asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/" title="24-264MR ASIC flags key observations from inaugural IDR data publication">24-264MR</a>)&nbsp;<em>ASIC flags key observations from inaugural IDR data publication</em>&nbsp;(3 December 2024).</p>
<p>Under the framework, most licensed financial firms are required to report IDR data to ASIC on a 6-monthly basis. Publishing IDR data promotes transparency by sharing valuable information with consumers, while also helping to drive improvements in IDR practices.</p>
<p>While we do not verify that financial firms&rsquo; self-reported data accurately reflects their underlying complaints handling, we found variations in the volume of complaints reported by comparable firms as well as gaps in the IDR data. This indicates the data reported to ASIC may not fully reflect the complaints received by some firms. As a result, we are concerned that some firms are not reporting IDR data as accurately as is possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, 5,035 firms declared no complaints to report for the full year. This number is higher than we expected.</p>
<p>We will assess compliance with the reporting requirements, such as by reviewing firms that make a nil submission against other datasets, including reports of misconduct, reportable situations and data from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. While there may be reasonable explanations for some of these variances, we encourage firms to carefully review our report and guidance to assist in reporting complete and accurate IDR data.</p>
<p>This year we will start publishing data about complaints received by individual firms. It is crucial that firms act now to address any gaps in IDR reporting processes, because we will publish the data as it is reported to us.</p>
<p>More information about IDR reporting obligations is available on ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting/" title="Internal dispute resolution data reporting">IDR data reporting page</a>&nbsp;(which includes frequently asked questions) and in Regulatory Guide 271&nbsp;<em>Internal dispute resolution&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-271-internal-dispute-resolution/" title="RG 271 Internal dispute resolution">RG 271</a>).</p>
<h2><a id="first-report"></a>First report on the adoption of artificial intelligence by licensees</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the provision of financial services and credit in Australia. It provides opportunities for more efficient, accessible and tailored products and services. However, AI can also amplify existing risks to consumers and introduce new ones. Potential harms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bias and discrimination</li>
<li>provision of false information</li>
<li>exploitation of consumer vulnerabilities and behavioural biases, and</li>
<li>erosion of consumer trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shape our understanding of risk to consumers and inform our regulatory response, we reviewed the use of AI by 23 AFS and credit licensees and published our findings in Report 798&nbsp;<em>Beware the gap:&nbsp;Governance arrangements in the face of AI innovation</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-798-beware-the-gap-governance-arrangements-in-the-face-of-ai-innovation/" title="REP 798 Beware the gap: Governance arrangements in the face of AI innovation">REP 798</a>).</p>
<p>The report noted a rapid acceleration in the volume of AI use cases and a shift towards more complex and opaque types of AI such as generative AI. The licensees also told us they are planning to increase their use of AI.</p>
<p>We are concerned that not all licensees are well-positioned to manage the challenges of their expanding AI use. Changes in governance and risk management arrangements are slow; it is therefore likely that any gap between AI use and AI governance arrangements will widen as AI adoption increases. This could leave licensees unprepared to respond quickly but safely to innovations from competitors.</p>
<p>ASIC is urging financial services licensees to ensure their governance practices keep pace with their accelerating adoption of AI.</p>

<h2><a id="update-fscp"></a>Update from the Financial Services and Credit Panel</h2>
<p>The Financial Services and Credit Panel (FSCP) makes disciplinary decisions in relation to financial advisers. The FSCP has been in operation for 2 years. The FSCP is a pool of industry participants, appointed by the responsible Minister, that ASIC draws on when forming individual sitting panels.</p>
<p>The FSCP operates alongside but independent of ASIC&rsquo;s existing administrative decision-making processes. A sitting panel will be convened by ASIC to consider certain instances of suspected misconduct by, or circumstances relating to, a financial adviser. Each sitting panel comprises an ASIC staff member and at least two members of the FSCP. For further information on the functions and operation of the FSCP, see Regulatory Guide 263&nbsp;<em>Financial Services and Credit Panel</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-263-financial-services-and-credit-panel/" title="RG 263 Financial Services and Credit Panel">RG 263</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC maintains the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/financial-services-and-credit-panel-fscp/fscp-outcomes-register/" title="FSCP Outcomes Register">FSCP Outcomes Register</a>&nbsp;which contains decisions of the FSCP and a brief explanation of the background to the decisions. Some recent outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A written supervision direction to audit the next 10 pieces of advice by an independent person at the relevant provider&rsquo;s cost</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The sitting panel found that the relevant provider contravened sections 961B(1), 961G and 921E of the Corporations Act. They gave advice in June 2023 recommending a client roll over $2 million from an untaxed state superannuation scheme. When giving the advice, the relevant provider failed to take into account or disclose that the $2 million exceeded the untaxed cap rollover limit of $1.65 million, that the client had also previously used a portion of this limit, and that tax would be payable at a rate of 47% on amounts exceeding the cap. As a result of accepting the advice, the client paid $201,365 in tax for exceeding the cap.</li>
<li><strong>A reprimand issued to a relevant provider for contraventions of sections 961B(1), 961G and 921E(3) of the Corporations Act&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The relevant provider recommended a client make a non-concessional superannuation contribution of $329,000 in the 2022&ndash;23 financial year when the client&rsquo;s non-concessional cap for that year was $220,000. When giving the advice, the relevant provider failed to obtain or take into account superannuation assets in the client&rsquo;s public sector superannuation fund. As a result, the client needed to withdraw $120,735 from their superannuation and pay tax of $13,570 on the associated earning.</li>
<li><strong>A warning issued to a relevant provider for contravention of section 946A(1) of the Corporations Act&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The relevant provider was found to have failed to give a Statement of Advice to a client. Between February 2022 and November 2022, the relevant provider gave Records of Advice to clients, relying on Statements of Advice that had been given to the clients by a different providing entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="review-advice"></a>Review of advice on establishing a self-managed super fund</h2>
<p>In ASIC&rsquo;s Corporate Plan 2024&ndash;25, we announced that we will conduct a surveillance of personal advice provided to retail clients about establishing SMSFs. This will involve a thematic review across numerous AFS licensees and advisers. We will focus on why some consumers are advised to set up an SMSF, even though an SMSF may not be suitable for them and may adversely affect their retirement outcomes.</p>
<p>The project follows a thematic SMSF advice review which led to the release of Report 575<em>&nbsp;SMSFs: Improving the quality of advice and member experiences&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-575-smsfs-improving-the-quality-of-advice-and-member-experiences/" title="REP 575 SMSFs: Improving the quality of advice and member experiences">REP 575</a>) in June 2018 and Information Sheet 274<em>&nbsp;Tips for giving self-managed superannuation fund advice</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/tips-for-giving-self-managed-superannuation-fund-advice/" title="Tips for giving self-managed superannuation fund advice">INFO 274</a>) in December 2022.</p>
<p>The two main streams of work are underway concurrently and involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reviewing client advice files where SMSF establishment advice has been provided &ndash; ASIC will assess compliance with the best interest duty and related obligations, and</li>
<li>observing the role of AFS licensees in monitoring and supervising their representatives who are providing SMSF establishment advice &ndash; this includes considering information obtained from licensees about their oversight and the application of their policies and procedures in the context of providing SMSF establishment advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach of considering licensees&rsquo; roles and reviewing advice files is similar to our approach for Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>), released in February 2024.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of our project, we expect to release public messages about our findings. Where appropriate, we will take enforcement or other regulatory action against misconduct.</p>
<h2><a id="reportable"></a>Reportable situations regime update</h2>
<p>The reportable situations regime (formerly breach reporting) is a cornerstone of the financial services and credit regulatory regimes. The regime acknowledges that, despite an expectation of compliance, breaches will occur, and AFS licensees then have an obligation to report these to ASIC.</p>
<p>Licensees have a clear role in lifting industry standards as a whole, and part of this role is timely identification of their own breaches. The requirement to report to ASIC also encourages licensees to rectify and remediate issues in a timely manner, and the reports we receive are a critical source of regulatory intelligence for ASIC.</p>
<p>Report 800&nbsp;<em>Insights from the reportable situations regime: July 2023 to June 2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-800-insights-from-the-reportable-situations-regime-july-2023-to-june-2024/" title="REP 800 Insights from the reportable situations regime: July 2023 to June 2024">REP 800</a>) is ASIC&rsquo;s third publication of the information we have received under the reportable situations regime. It provides high-level insights into the trends observed in reports lodged by licensees under the regime between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024.</p>
<p>We have also published information on how licensees can improve their compliance through finding, fixing and reporting breaches in our news item,&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/reportable-situations-findings-of-asic-s-review-and-how-licensees-can-improve-compliance-with-the-regime/" title="Reportable situations: Findings of ASIC&rsquo;s review and how licensees can improve compliance with the regime">Reportable situations: Findings of ASIC&rsquo;s review and how licensees can improve compliance with the regime</a>&nbsp;(4 December 2024).</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Provides Clarity To e-money/payment Services Providers On Licensing Requirements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-provides-clarity-to-e-moneypayment-serv-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-provides-clarity-to-e-moneypayment-serv-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FMA is pleased to clarify the licensing requirements for e-money and payment service providers. In short, there is no specific licence for e-money institutions or payments service providers in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Instead, providers will have a range of obligations under New Zealand&rsquo;s financial services regulatory regime, either through the Financial Markets Conduct Act, or the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act. The level of regulation will largely depend on whether providers are issuing debt securities as part of their service offering. This would be the case if, in connection with the e-money or payments service, providers accept customer deposits or other repayable funds (other than on trust). &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the FMA&rsquo;s purposes is promote innovation and flexibility while also ensuring consumers understand what they are buying. Through recent conversations with industry, we heard from providers who wanted greater clarity from the FMA on the requirements.</p>
<p>E-money and payment service providers offer services such as storing and managing electronic money (e-wallets), virtual currencies and currency conversions. It&rsquo;s a service that has the potential to offer genuine competition to the non-banking sector and one we believe should be embraced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you seek independent legal advice if you think this may apply to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can read more about what the requirements are if you are issuing debt securities as part of your service offering, as well as the FMA&rsquo;s expectations here.</p>

<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, today was named to the Chartis RiskTech&reg; Energy50 ranking of the world&rsquo;s major players in energy and risk technology. Ranked at #14 in its first appearance on the list, TT also won the award for Trade Surveillance: Energy Exchange Traded Markets.</p>
<p>Every year, the Energy50 assesses the top 50 energy technology vendors, focusing on their ability to innovate in risk trading analytics, compliance and operational efficiency. The detailed analysis considers factors such as firms&rsquo; market influence, technological advances and strategic direction, to provide &ldquo;a complete view of the ways in which these market leaders are driving transformation in the sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alun Green, TT&rsquo;s EVP Managing Director, Futures &amp; Options, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored that Chartis, which is quite thorough in its research, has identified TT as driving transformation in the energy sector and contributing to the success of institutions operating in the energy markets and other asset classes. One recent enhancement that builds on our presence in energy is launching access to the two leading intraday power markets in Europe, providing side-by-side trading opportunities in the financial and physical markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jay Biondo, Head of Surveillance at TT, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve put significant resources into strengthening our TT Trade Surveillance offering and ensuring that it provides a comprehensive compliance solution &ndash; now across a range of asset classes. Clients can leverage dozens of configurable models to identify and address a full range of behaviors and our new, patent-pending cross-instrument models that detect patterns of spoofing behavior across markets, exchanges and products, utilizing our AI-driven machine learning-based spoofing models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In December, Trading Technologies earned the number 12 spot in the Chartis Buyside Platforms 2024 ranking of the top 50 providers of buy-side platforms and technology. Chartis also gave TT &ldquo;strong category leader&rdquo; status for both energy and equity trade surveillance solutions in its December Market Quadrants report, providing a detailed evaluation of key providers offering advanced surveillance solutions unique to these markets. In October, Chartis recognized TT as one of the world&rsquo;s top risk and compliance technology providers in its RiskTech100&reg; 2025 rankings, highlighting the company as the fourth best new entrant among the 22 firms that debuted in this year&rsquo;s rankings.</p>

<title>The EBA Amends Its Guidelines On ICT And Security Risk Management Measures In The Context Of DORA Application</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) narrowed down the scope of its existing Guidelines on ICT and security risk management measures, due to the application of harmonised ICT risk management requirements under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) from 17 January 2025. &nbsp;These amendments aim at simplifying the ICT risk management framework and providing legal clarity to the market.</span></p>
<p>DORA has introduced harmonised requirements on ICT risk management that apply to financial entities across the banking, securities/markets, insurance and pensions sectors.</p>
<p>To avoid duplication of requirements and to provide legal clarity to the market, the EBA has amended its Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. In particular, the EBA has narrowed down:</p>
<ul>
<li>the entity scope of the Guidelines to only those that are covered by DORA, namely credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, exempted payment institutions and exempted e-money institutions; and</li>
<li>the scope of the Guidelines to the requirements on relationship management of the payment service users in relation to the provision of payment services.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that security and operational risk management requirements under the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which are applicable since March 2018, continue to apply to other types of payment service providers (PSPs), such as post-office giro institutions and credit unions, that are not covered by DORA. PSPs that are still subject to security and operational risk management under the PSD2 can potentially be subject to additional national requirements, regardless of the existence of the EBA Guidelines that would apply to them. Competent authorities or Member States&rsquo; governments wishing to retain the approach set out in the EBA Guidelines for those PSPs can continue to do so under their national legal framework or supervisory measures.</p>
<h4>Background, legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>On 27 November 2019, the&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk84240753">EBA published the&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2020/GLs%20on%20ICT%20and%20security%20risk%20management/872936/Final%20draft%20Guidelines%20on%20ICT%20and%20security%20risk%20management.pdf">Guidelines on ICT and security risk management</a>&nbsp;(EBA/GL/2019/04)&nbsp;(&ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo;) which were built on the provisions of Article&nbsp;74 of&nbsp;Directive&nbsp;2013/36/EU (CRD)<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-amends-its-guidelines-ict-and-security-risk-management-measures-context-dora-application#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;and Article&nbsp;95(3) of Directive (EU)&nbsp;2015/2366 (PSD2)<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-amends-its-guidelines-ict-and-security-risk-management-measures-context-dora-application#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;. These Guidelines established requirements for credit institutions, investment firms and PSPs on the mitigation and management of their ICT and security risks and aim to ensure a consistent and robust approach across the Single market. The Guidelines entered into force in 2020 and replaced and repealed the preceding Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks that the EBA had issued three years earlier in fulfilment of a mandate under PSD2 (EBA GL/2017/17).</p>
<p>From 17 January 2025, DORA applies and introduces, inter alia, harmonised requirements for ICT risk management framework (RMF), incident reporting, and third-party risk management and testing.</p>
<p>The amended Guidelines will apply within two months of the publication of the translated versions.</p>

<p>Overview of the results:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>The Group's net revenue increased by a total of 15 per cent to &euro;5,829 million in 2024; organic growth amounted to 8 per cent.</li>
<li>EBITDA of &euro;3,396 million saw an increase of 15 per cent.</li>
<li>The Group has therefore significantly exceeded its original guidance for the full year.</li>
<li>For the dividend, the Executive Board is proposing an increase to &euro;4.00 per share.</li>
<li>In addition, the Group announces a new share buyback program with a volume of &euro;500 million.</li>
<li>For 2025, the Group expects further organic growth and net revenue without treasury result of around &euro;5.2 billion and EBITDA without treasury result of around &euro;2.7 billion.</li>
<li>Stephan Leithner, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG, comments on the results as follows: &ldquo;In 2024, we once again significantly increased our net revenue. We have benefited from strong organic growth across the entire Group - even excluding interest income. Our great commodities business, the strong core business of Securities Services and the very good performance of Software Solutions were the main revenue drivers. Through effective management, we minimized organic cost growth and once again achieved a disproportionate increase in profits. We let our shareholders participate in this positive development by increasing the total distribution including share buybacks to a record level of more than &euro;1.2 billion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Commenting on the outlook, Stephan Leithner says: &ldquo;We are well on track to achieve our strategic and financial targets for 2026.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I am going to spend most of the time today setting out the scale and significance of changes in financial market activity in recent years, and what this means for financial stability. My main message is that the significance of these changes has not been fully taken on board in many assessments of the challenges facing financial stability and the tools we need to assess the risks the changes have created. I will also put these issues into some broader context, around the role of central banks and of regulation.</p>
<p>An important theme here is that of moving to a financial system in which the presence and impact of non-banks and market-based finance is much larger. In this context, I will set out the importance of two recent Bank of England innovations which are I think pioneering in the central banking world: these are our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/boe-system-wide-exploratory-scenario-exercise/boe-swes-exercise-final-report">System Wide Exploratory Scenario</a>, a new form of stress test tool, and the introduction of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025">new contingent liquidity facility</a>&nbsp;for some non-banks. There is another important area of focus involving non-bank finance, namely the growth of private credit. That is not my focus today.</p>
<p>Let me start with the broader context. Four points stand out.</p>
<p>First, we have learned from long experience that central banks have two core purposes, monetary and financial stability, and that while policies in respect of each need to be focused and thus separate, they are dependent on one another to a very high degree. Specifically, for much of the existence of central banks, financial stability has not had the prominence or institutional development that has occurred with monetary policy. Even today, it can at times feel as if it is living in the shadow. Some central banks, like the<br />Bank of England, have gone further and operate with an institutional structure that ensures equal ranking across the two core purposes, but that is by no means universal.</p>
<p>Second, central banking is inherently a counter-cyclical activity. It took time for this to become monetary orthodoxy in the nineteenth century, and even more time for it to become explicitly part of the macroprudential approach to financial stability after the experience of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) over 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Third, central banking policy making has to incorporate a substantial global context. Ultimately, the policies are national ones, but they have to reflect and incorporate global risks and events. This has been the case since at least the 1870s, which saw probably the first globally synchronised financial crisis. Global standards are an anchor for national standards. Set right, they facilitate openness and economic growth.</p>
<p>Fourth, one of the orthodoxies of central banking is that we act as the ultimate providers of liquidity to our banking system. In doing so, we seek to achieve our critical outcomes, namely: implementing the chosen official interest rate as the means to anchor monetary policy and achieve low inflation and price stability; achieving financial stability via the provision of high quality liquidity in the form of so-called central bank money; and third, achieving and preserving the singleness of money, so that all forms of money have an assured equal nominal value (the pound in my bank is worth the same as the pound in your bank, and will remain so).</p>
<p>It has over time become central bank canon law that we transact with banks. In other words, the banking system has a special place, as the conduit for the transmission of central bank policies. This is the central bank equivalent of the old Heineken advert, &ldquo;Refreshes the Parts Other Beers Cannot Reach&rdquo;. The key point here is the assumption that in all states of the world &ndash; non-stressed and stressed &ndash; central bank liquidity supplied through the banks would reach those parts of the financial system and economy in need.</p>
<p>Moreover, you don&rsquo;t have to go far back in time, certainly not to the start of my career forty years ago, to find that the Bank of England&rsquo;s interface was with a small number of banks &ndash; though admittedly they represented a large share of the system (and in saying that I am deliberately overlooking the role of discount houses &ndash; a rather unique British feature). During the operation of these arrangements, there were times when strains in terms of the efficiency of the liquidity flow were evident, but for a long time this system held together.</p>
<p>However, over time the issue of whether financial stability policies which are aimed at the banking system can be relied upon to ensure stability across the whole financial system has come increasingly to the forefront. In this sense, the issue is not new. This year marks forty years since I joined the Bank of England. One of the first things I worked on after joining in 1985 was to have a very small role in a BIS study called Recent Innovations in International Banking, chaired by Sam Cross of the New York Fed. In thinking about my remarks today, I went back to that report &ndash; after a long break &ndash; and particularly the conclusions it drew on so-called macro-prudential policy, and the role of the non-bank financial system. It&rsquo;s worth drawing out again five points made in the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the highest quality borrowers increasingly turning to direct credit markets, the average quality of banks&rsquo; loan assets may gradually decline by comparison;</li>
<li>In view of its narrower base, the international banking system might become less responsive to sudden liquidity needs or other shocks in the corporate or other borrowing sectors;</li>
<li>A greater share of credit is likely to flow through capital market channels, which may be characterised by less supervision, but less complete information on which to base credit decisions, and by more distant business relationships between debtor and creditor, perhaps complicating the task of arranging rescheduling or financing packages for those with debt servicing problems;</li>
<li>Both banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) are relying more on income from off-balance sheet business; and</li>
<li>The distinction between banks and other financial institutions is becoming progressively blurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds familiar? Bear in mind, this was written 20 years before the GFC. As a spoiler for what&rsquo;s to come, I asked myself the question, what did the report miss that we now know? Two things stand out I think: the growth of leverage in the non-bank sector; and the growth of markets in sovereign tradeable debt &ndash; the report was focused much more on corporate debt.</p>
<p>So, what happened after that report was published? The regulatory world focused more on regulating financial stability through regulating the banking system. This was the emerging world of the Basel Agreements. The GFC rocked that world.</p>
<p>Out of that experience came several things: more Basel, in terms of microprudential regulation; mandatory clearing and placing clearing houses at the centre of the system to enhance resilience; a much enhanced focus on global macro financial stability, with the Financial Stability Board to the forefront; and a recognition that there needs to be a more explicit role for macroprudential policy.</p>
<p>What also came out of the GFC and post-GFC policies was a further shift in the balance of financial intermediation from the banking to the non-banking system, with the non-bank sector now making up nearly 50% of global financial assets compared to 40% for the banking sector. And so for the last fifteen years we have increasingly seen the emergence of risks to financial stability originating in the non-bank system.</p>
<p>This is the backdrop to the next section of my remarks today, which seeks to draw out just how much the system has changed in the last few years.</p>
<p>The key theme here is how much activity and risk in core financial markets now largely resides outside the banking system. This is not a new theme, given the post GFC changes, and it was the correct response to the dangers realised in the GFC of inappropriate risk inside the banking system. Our assessment is that the pace and scale of change in this direction continues to gather momentum. The footprint of hedge funds and non-bank market makers has grown substantially in recent years. Alongside this, what I will &ndash; without in any sense wishing to be disparaging &ndash; call the more traditional asset management industry has refocused towards passive investment strategies. Meanwhile, the role of banks has shifted towards providing risk warehousing and financing to markets and NBFIs. These are fundamental changes in the dynamics of markets.</p>
<p>Three non-bank business models stand out as dominant players in this rapidly evolving landscape.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ve seen the rise of multi-manager hedge funds in which individual portfolio managers &ndash; or &ldquo;pods&rdquo; &ndash; trade independently from one another under the banner of a single fund. These funds are large, sophisticated and manage risk centrally to ensure sufficient diversification. Their diversification means that they can benefit from a high degree of leverage from banks. They&rsquo;ve also benefitted from an influx of talent from banks. There are benefits of this type of fund structure. It is a world where more and more portfolio managers operate under sophisticated umbrella risk management which can lean against large fund-level concentrations. However, there could be circumstances in which the means by which multi-manager funds protect themselves in this respect can create risks to the system. Specifically, where risk management results in pods de-risking aggressively in a shock, this could result in these funds amplifying market moves.</p>
<p>Second, systematic strategies which trade based on complex statistical models and rules and market signals rather than fundamentals are becoming more popular. These strategies were at one time the preserve of the FX and equity markets but are now becoming more prevalent in the fixed income world enabled by technological innovation. Their presence has increased the speed at which markets react as well as the number of instances of technical-driven corrections that are difficult to explain based on the fundamental outlook. They too obtain a high degree of leverage from banks.</p>
<p>Third, non-bank market makers, notably high frequency and principal trading firms, have grown substantially in scale and scope globally. They previously undertook intra-day market activity but are now moving into carrying risk for longer periods of time. Market liquidity in normal times appears to have improved because of their presence. To illustrate this, throughout the substantial movements in bond yields during recent months we have not seen stress in terms of market functioning. The evidence of whether these entities help or hinder market liquidity in stress is more mixed.</p>
<p>Whilst the growing scale of these non-bank exposures has been absorbed by banks acting as prime brokers so far, such trends, if they continue, could have a profound effect on banks &lsquo; balance sheet capacity in the future.&nbsp; As fund leverage increases and risk asset prices rise inexorably over time, there comes a point at which an inevitable strain is placed upon the system.&nbsp; An excess of demand for financing resources over their supply could lead to repricing, tempting existing players to overreach and take on more risk than they should. Conversely, new entrants which are ill equipped to scale up quickly could be exposed to risks that could be highly damaging.</p>
<p>In sum, the market looks very different to what it was only five years ago. It involves large shifts in leverage, pricing power, speed of trading and liquidity provision. To be clear, these changes are not inherently bad, but they could create a new set of financial stability vulnerabilities which we need to understand and monitor and adapt new tools and approaches where appropriate.</p>
<p>Among these potential vulnerabilities, I would highlight a number:</p>
<ul>
<li>An increased likelihood and severity of procyclical jumps to illiquidity and large market moves that are unexplained by fundamentals. Multi-manager funds can make individual &ldquo;pods&rdquo; deleverage rapidly in stress conditions, which can exaggerate market moves. Smaller funds are more exposed to banks withdrawing financing. Systematic funds can deleverage automatically in response to a change in price signals. And,<br />non-bank market makers, while active in normal times may withdraw liquidity in a stress;</li>
<li>Second, there is a tendency towards increased concentration and interconnectedness given that these large hedge funds and market makers operate across all significant financial markets and represent the bulk of banks&rsquo; prime brokerage balance sheets;</li>
<li>Third, there is greater evidence of correlated activity. The funds are generally well capitalised and have longer gating periods than in the past, but both their trading and risk management strategies tend to be quite similar, increasing the prospect of common responses. While multi-managers are well placed to avoid correlations within each fund, correlation can still emerge across different funds as different multi-managers are often attracted to similar types of strategies; and</li>
<li>Fourth, opacity and limited visibility in certain markets tends to lead to crowded trades, impairs risk management, and is more likely to prompt a rush to the exit in times of stress. We have seen evidence of this in a number of market events in recent years. An example is the Archegos incident where the limited visibility of the overall position made it hard for any single participant to manage and scale their exposure and in my assessment made the eventual problem when it materialised more of a threat to market stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to use the rest of my time to answer the question, what do we do about the risks and vulnerabilities that can arise from this change of market structure? To be clear, the answer is not to seek to stand in the way of change. That&rsquo;s not sensible. There are good reasons why these changes are happening. Many of the trends being seen can support smoother and more efficient market dynamics and pricing in normal times, as well as increased and improved liquidity. They also provide an opportunity to diversify finance and lending to the real economy and if undertaken in a sustainable way then these developments can play a role in supporting growth.</p>
<p>There are good reasons why moving activity out of the banking system has happened. There are areas of risk taking that are not suited to being directly backed by deposits, and thus putting those deposits at risk. That was a lesson of the financial crisis. They are better being directly backed by what I would describe as investment capital. But a key point here is that it needs to be very clear to the providers that the investment capital is at risk, and that this is what goes with the returns. Mostly this understanding is in place, but sometimes it turns out not to be.</p>
<p>But if that takes care of the direct risk, we are still left with a substantial financial stability vulnerability arising from the more indirect risks, those that are less well understood, and can often put the system more broadly into difficulty. This is classic modern financial stability risk. The banking system may not be directly exposed to these risks, but in my experience there is a limited understanding of indirect risks which can arise at times of stress. And we seem to be more reliant on market-making and market liquidity provision from firms which are not so directly wired into the more assured forms of backstop liquidity, including from central banks. Likewise, the transparency of margining practices to increase predictability and thus liquidity management for NBFIs has become a focus of international work.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a pitch for the necessity and inevitabilities of more regulation. We are now in a world where attitudes towards regulation have changed, not I should say for the first time in my career. Hyman Minsky wisely pointed out that as memories of crises past recede, so attitudes towards regulation change. To paraphrase the historian Tony Judt, it is wise to avoid the idea that regulation is the best solution to any problem, but let&rsquo;s not fall into the opposite notion that it is by definition and always the worst available<br />option.&nbsp;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/andrew-bailey-keynote-speech-university-of-chicago-booth-school-of-business#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is important in today&rsquo;s setting that we have a fully informed debate about the role of regulation. That said, I want to emphasise three points. First, there is not a fundamental trade off between growth and financial stability. We must always assess the best choices to make in terms of the tools that we use, but the financial crisis demonstrated that there is no sustainable growth without financial stability. The issue of low potential growth and thus low actual growth that is with us today is not a creation of recent times; rather it goes back to the financial crisis, the serious recession that followed and the long-term loss of output. Second, we must not abandon or compromise our commitment to the surveillance of risks to financial stability &ndash; to pointing out the vulnerabilities and their potential consequences &ndash; the more so in view of the fundamental changes to the system I have just described. And, third, we must retain the ability to act on these risks, and always ensure that we have the ex-ante tools to deal with potential problems.</p>
<p>Surveillance enables us to be targeted in our regulatory approach, and focus on the most important financial stability risks and have the right tools to deal with the problems we identify.</p>
<p>On surveillance, we have undertaken a path-breaking new exercise at the Bank of England, our System-Wide Exploratory Scenario Exercise, or SWES (because we like acronyms). We conducted it with help from the Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. It is more of a flow type stress test than a traditional bank stress test. In other words, we explored injecting stress into the financial system and the consequences of its flowing through the system.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;SWES tested the resilience of markets that are core to the UK&rsquo;s economy by enhancing the understanding of the behaviours under stressed conditions of banks and NBFIs active in those markets. The primary objectives were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance understanding of the risks to and from NBFIs, and the behaviour of NBFIs and banks in stress, including what drives those behaviours; and</li>
<li>investigate how these behaviours and market dynamics can amplify shocks in markets and potentially pose risks to UK financial stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise was a first of its kind. It involved more than 50 market participants and covered a wide range of business models. It provided insights into the behaviour of different parts of the financial system under stress, and into the market dynamics and financial stability risks driven by their interactions. The SWES was not a test of the resilience of individual participants, but instead focused on system-wide resilience, with a focus on core UK financial markets.</p>
<p>The findings from the SWES provided insights into how, although rational individually, the behaviours of market participants could combine in ways that pose systemic risks. The exercise highlighted mismatches in firms' expectations of how others would act in a stress scenario. It also improved the understanding of risk management within the financial system and informed work to address vulnerabilities in market-based finance.</p>
<p>The SWES scenario comprised a rapid and significant shock to rates and credit spreads triggering significant losses and margin calls, with margin flowing from NBFIs to banks and central clearing parties (CCPs). The large and rapid market shock generated a significant liquidity need for many NBFIs in the form of margin calls and redemption requests. This liquidity impact combined with leverage and risk constraints, as well as investment strategies and other commercial drivers of behaviour, led to some NBFIs having to recapitalise and/or deleverage rapidly. Banks had limited appetite to take on additional risk in some core UK markets. Through derisking and deleveraging, the financial system acted to distribute and amplify the impact of the shock and some core UK markets came under pressure.</p>
<p>The SWES has provided us with important insights. In particular, I would highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding financial institutions&rsquo; behaviours and interactions:</strong>&nbsp;The exercise highlighted how the behaviours of different financial institutions can interact to amplify market shocks, for example how calls for additional capital from leveraged entities can result in automatic and correlated sales of securities. This understanding is crucial for developing policies that mitigate systemic risks.</li>
<li><strong>Mismatches in expectations of counterparties&rsquo; actions under stress, and risk management improvements:</strong>&nbsp;The SWES identified mismatches in firms' expectations of each other's actions during stress. For instance, users of cleared derivatives struggled accurately to estimate increases in initial margin due to the lack of transparency in CCP models, and users of repo markets overestimated their access to new repo funding under stress. This insight supports better risk management practices and helps firms prepare for potential market disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced surveillance and systemic risk assessment capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;The SWES provides a more comprehensive view of the financial system's dynamics under stress, which enhances our surveillance capabilities. This allows for more proactive identification and mitigation of systemic risks and the SWES report makes recommendations for UK markets.</li>
<li><strong>Insights into potential cross border spillovers:&nbsp;</strong>For example, we also saw that hedge funds are particularly sensitive to conditions in the US Treasury repo market. A sudden increase in haircuts or contraction in repo availability would have a significant impact on a number of hedge funds. Their response to a shift in repo financing conditions would not necessarily be contained to US Treasuries and could impact upon other markets.</li>
<li><strong>Policy development:</strong>&nbsp;The findings from the SWES are informing policy work to address vulnerabilities in market-based finance. This includes enhancing the resilience of core UK financial markets and improving the overall stability of the financial system. In many cases the exercise provides further evidence to support existing policy work and new areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SWES has demonstrated that such a system-wide approach is a valuable way to understand systemic risk in core markets.</p>
<p>We intend to invest in system-wide capabilities building on the SWES lessons learned. There are two main components to this. First, the SWES has allowed us to start to build modelling capability that could support lighter touch versions of SWES-type exercises for core UK markets in the future, supplemented with targeted engagement with financial firms to ensure behavioural assumptions remain appropriate. Second, we will consider whether to use SWES style exercises to explore risks in other markets over time. These exercises are particularly well suited to markets where interconnections and feedback are key, and where key firms are at the edge of the regulatory perimeter, where behavioural assumptions are critical, or where there are significant data gaps.</p>
<p>Moreover, for such an exercise to be most effective and targeted, prudential supervisors need to have a clear view of where risks are building within the system. Supervisors need to employ methods that are designed to identify and assess areas of potential vulnerability, using tools such as thematic reviews of emerging or growing risks, co-ordinated<br />multi-jurisdictional examinations of key global business lines (with home and host supervisors working together), and other techniques that enable effective peer comparison across banks.</p>
<p>I want to end back on the subject of liquidity provision in times of stress. I set out the canon law of central banking that liquidity goes through the banking system on the basis that the Heineken ad principle will apply in terms of the reach of these central bank lending facilities.</p>
<p>However, what we saw in the so-called Dash for Cash in early 2020 with the onset of Covid, and then the 2022 LDI episode were conditions in markets that demonstrated how vulnerabilities in NBFIs can propagate liquidity stress in core UK financial markets, notably the gilt market, and create a prospect of forced selling of gilts that could jeopardise financial stability.</p>
<p>NBFIs should manage the risks they face, and in some parts of the system it is appropriate that regulations are in place to provide more assurance of this management taking place. This is a key objective of the global Financial Stability Board. That said, it is not feasible or economic for NBFIs to maintain resilience to ensure self-insurance against the most extreme system-wide stresses, where the consequences may be forced selling and wider market disruption and a risk to financial stability. And, if the Heineken ad principle can&rsquo;t always be relied on in view of the changes in markets that I have described, in such circumstances central bank facilities should support financial stability by providing backstop liquidity to NBFIs and thus reduce the need to sell assets on a forced basis.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we have developed the Contingent NBFI Repo Facility, or CNRF, to tackle severe disruption in the gilt market that threatens financial stability due to shocks that increase the demand of NBFIs for liquidity.</p>
<p>The CNRF is a contingent facility to be activated at our discretion in view of the scale of the systemic stress in core markets and the ability of our traditional lending facilities for banks to mitigate that stress. It is not a standing facility. It will lend cash against gilt collateral to participating insurance companies, pension funds and liability-driven investment funds for a short term. The pricing will reflect the principle that it should be at a penalty rate.</p>
<p>This does widen the direct reach of our liquidity provision to eligible NBFIs that demonstrate an appropriate level of financial health. We think this is appropriate in view of changes to the financial system and the risks to financial stability from outside the banking system. But, it does not change a key central banking principle, namely that the standing provision of liquidity to support the so-called singleness of money goes only to the banks.</p>
<p>Both standing facilities and contingent facilities are available to banks because they create money and we need to ensure its singleness both in normal times and in times of severe market dysfunction and financial instability.&nbsp; There is no rationale for standing facilities for non-banks as they do not create money.&nbsp; There is only a rationale for a contingent facility because the evidence suggests that we need to adapt the Heineken principle only when there is a market dysfunction and on a temporary basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, it modifies and extends the Heineken ad approach, but does not change the principle that the scope and definition of money is limited to the central bank and commercial banks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my title today posed the question: &ldquo;Are we underestimating changes in financial markets?&rdquo; You may have decided by now that my answer to this question is yes. Moreover, the pace of change shows no signs of dropping off. As authorities responsible for ensuring financial stability, both domestically and globally, we have to keep our assessment and understanding up to speed. On this point, I want to thank all those, in the UK and overseas, who work with our teams at the Bank of England to inform our assessment and understanding. We couldn&rsquo;t do this without the time that you give to us.</p>
<p>Our assessment tools need to change, as do our tools of intervention. I have focused on two big changes that we have made.</p>
<p>The first is to introduce more dynamic &ndash; flow-style &ndash; market stress exercises alongside the more established and more static institutional stress tests. This allows us to stress test markets more efficiently, and, critically, as part of that test the assumptions that market participants make about the reactions and behaviour of each other, and thus of markets as a whole. This process of holding a mirror up is crucial. The second change is the introduction of a contingent liquidity facility for certain non-banks, designed to act as protection against stress in core markets.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a reaction taking place against regulation, and the responses to the GFC. We must not forget the lasting damage done by the GFC. There is no trade off between economic growth and financial stability. That said, there are usually choices about how we deal with evidence of vulnerabilities. It is critical that we have and develop tools of assessment and intervention. But these interventions may not always need to be more regulation. They can be liquidity facilities, and they can be to improve areas of the financial infrastructure, such as introducing clearing for gilt repo, a conclusion of our SWES. We should approach the response to vulnerabilities with an open mind.</p>

<title>Statement On Pause In Litigation Concerning The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today acting Chairman Uyeda, without the input of the full Commission, has instructed the staff to ask the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to delay scheduling oral arguments in litigation challenging the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-change-021125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s briefs, &ldquo;do not reflect [the acting Chairman&rsquo;s] views,&rdquo; he wrote in a statement. As such, the court should be &ldquo;notified&rdquo; of certain changes, such as the change in composition of the Commission, and the recent Presidential Memorandum regarding a Regulatory Freeze.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-change-021125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The acting Chairman&rsquo;s public statement on the litigation quoted from his and Commissioner Peirce&rsquo;s statements at the time the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was adopted. To complete the proverbial picture, I noted then<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-change-021125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;(and reiterate now) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>As reflected in the comment file, investors, &ldquo;for years,&rdquo; have been calling for &ldquo;consistent, comparable, and reliable climate risk disclosures.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Commission has clear authority under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act to require disclosures that are in the public interest.... This well-established authority has been consistently relied upon, and affirmed and reaffirmed across dozens of disclosure rulemakings over multiple decades.&rdquo; Under this deep-rooted framework &ldquo;[o]ur disclosures cannot remain stagnant; we must provide investors the information they need to understand the risks associated with their public company investments in today&rsquo;s world. A different outcome would harm the markets and investors.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The critiques that I have heard about our rulemaking attempt to disguise our authority as something that it is not. It is said that we are not an environmental agency and that we should not be in the business of supporting green agendas or setting pollution standards. Those statements are true. But, we are in the business of requiring public company disclosure about risk. We have done it myriad times without having our authority questioned.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the acting Chairman that agencies and those who lead them must act within the boundaries of constitutional and statutory authority. Nonetheless, I dispute with equal vigor the notion that the agency acted outside of its remit. It did not. The only things that have changed since the Rule was passed have been matters of politics and not substance. As such, I disagree with the position unilaterally taken today by the acting Chairman.</p>

<title>Semiannual Monetary Policy Report To The Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, Before The Committee On Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/semiannual-monetary-policy-report-to-the-congress-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-2025211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/semiannual-monetary-policy-report-to-the-congress-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-2025211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/mpr_default.htm">Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on achieving its dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. We are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate.</p>
<p>I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Current Economic Situation and Outlook</strong><br />Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product rose 2.5 percent in 2024, bolstered by resilient consumer spending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have declined in the fourth quarter but was solid for the year overall. Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.</p>
<p>In the labor market, conditions remain solid and appear to have stabilized. Payroll job gains averaged 189,000 per month over the past four months. Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has been steady since the middle of last year and, at 4 percent in January, remains low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The strong labor market conditions in recent years have helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20250211a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, and, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Since last September, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak after having maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for 14 months. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the cooling in the labor market. Meanwhile, we have continued to reduce our securities holdings.</p>
<p>With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. We are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate, and policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face.</p>
<p>This year, we are conducting the second periodic review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications&mdash;the framework used to pursue our congressionally assigned goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The focus of this review is on the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee's approach to monetary policy, and on the Committee's policy communications tools. The Committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and will not be a focus of the review.</p>
<p>Our review will include outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events around the country and a research conference in May. We will take on board lessons of the past five years and adapt our approach where appropriate to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable. We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by emphasizing that at the Fed, we will do everything we can to achieve the two goals Congress set for monetary policy&mdash;maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</p>
<p>Thank you. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>Acting SEC Chairman, Mark T. Uyeda,  Statement On Climate-Related Disclosure Rules</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today, I am taking action on The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors rule that was adopted by the Commission on March 6, 2024 (the &ldquo;Rule&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Rule is currently being challenged in litigation consolidated in the Eighth Circuit<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;and the Commission previously stayed effectiveness of the Rule pending completion of that litigation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The Rule is deeply flawed and could inflict significant harm on the capital markets and our economy.</p>
<p>Both Commissioner Peirce and I voted against the Rule&rsquo;s adoption.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Commissioner Peirce said that then-existing disclosure rules were sufficient and that the &ldquo;[R]ule&rsquo;s anticipated benefits do not outweigh the costs.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;She argued that &ldquo;only a mandate from Congress should put us in the business of facilitating the disclosure of information not clearly related to financial returns.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;I stated that the Commission was &ldquo;without statutory authority or expertise&rdquo; to address climate change issues and that &ldquo;this [R]ule is climate regulation promulgated under the Commission&rsquo;s seal.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>During the comment period, many submissions likewise urged that the Rule not be adopted. Among the reasons were that the Rule would require a large volume of financially immaterial information, financially material climate-related risks were already subject to disclosure under existing rules, and the proposed rules overstepped the SEC&rsquo;s regulatory authority.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s briefs previously submitted in the cases consolidated in the Eighth Circuit do not reflect my views. The briefs defend the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of the Rule, but I continue to question the statutory authority of the Commission to adopt the Rule, the need for the Rule, and the evaluation of costs and benefits. I also question whether the agency followed the proper procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt the Rule.</p>
<p>The lack of statutory authority is a weighty factor. Commissioners have a constitutional obligation to determine the bounds of the agency&rsquo;s statutory authority, and my views on the Commission&rsquo;s authority here were the result of lengthy study and research informed by many comments on all sides of the issue.</p>
<p>These views, the recent change in the composition of the Commission, and the recent Presidential Memorandum regarding a Regulatory Freeze,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;bear on the conduct of this litigation. I believe that the Court and the parties should be notified of these changes.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have directed the Commission staff to notify the Court of the changed circumstances and request that the Court not schedule the case for argument to provide time for the Commission to deliberate and determine the appropriate next steps in these cases. The Commission will promptly notify the Court of its determination about its positions in the litigation.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury: United States, Australia, And The United Kingdom Jointly Sanction Key Infrastructure That Enables Ransomware Attacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Australia&rsquo;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office are jointly designating Zservers, a Russia- based bulletproof hosting (BPH) services provider, for its role in supporting LockBit ransomware attacks. LockBit, a Russia-based ransomware group best known for its ransomware variant of the same name, is one of the most deployed ransomware variants and was responsible for the November 2023 attack against the Industrial Commercial Bank of China U.S. broker- dealer. BPH service providers sell access to specialized servers and other computer infrastructure designed to evade detection and defy law enforcement attempts to disrupt these malicious activities. OFAC is also designating two Russian nationals who are key administrators of&nbsp;<b>Zservers</b>&nbsp;and have enabled ransomware attacks and other criminal activity.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on U.S. and international critical infrastructure,&rdquo; said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>This action builds on last year&rsquo;s trilateral cyber sanctions with Australia and the United Kingdom against Russian ransomware actor&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fjy2041/1/01010194f51b6bb0-11746899-99c5-4d4d-af7e-1c804a2f3745-000000/ggUV8Qa-DwJ-vNrmeeqJPMW866HdPZdroWnj6f2lxII=391" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Alexander Ermakov</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fjy2623/1/01010194f51b6bb0-11746899-99c5-4d4d-af7e-1c804a2f3745-000000/OfzB2Q-Qhh9fa5O6Ztbea3VuqfhXUv5NityhX2c92Gg=391" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">members of the Evil Corp ransomware group</a>. It also reflects a shared commitment to combatting cybercrime and degrading the support networks that enable bad actors to target victims in the United States and in allied countries. This action was developed with the support of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ZSERVERS: A RUSSIAN BULLETPROOF HOSTING SERVICES PROVIDER SUPPORTING RANSOMWARE AND CYBERCRIME&nbsp;</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span><b>Zservers</b>, headquartered in Barnaul, Russia, has advertised BPH services on known cybercriminal forums to evade law enforcement investigations and takedowns, as well as scrutiny from cybersecurity firms. Zservers has provided BPH services, including leasing numerous IP addresses, to LockBit affiliates, who have used the hosting services to coordinate and launch ransomware attacks. During a 2022 search of a known LockBit affiliate, Canadian law enforcement uncovered a laptop operating a virtual machine that was connected to a Zservers&rsquo; subleased IP address and running a programming interface used to operate LockBit malware. In 2022, a Russian cybercriminal purchased IP addresses from Zservers, almost certainly for use as Lockbit chat servers to discuss ransomware operations. In 2023, Zservers leased infrastructure, including a Russian IP address, to a Lockbit affiliate.</span></p>
<p><span>OFAC is designating Zservers pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as further amended by E.O. 14144, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, LockBit ransomware, a cyber- enabled activity originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or substantial part, outside the United States that is reasonably likely to result in, or has materially contributed to, a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that has the purpose of or involves causing a misappropriation of funds or economic resources, intellectual property, proprietary or business confidential information, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.</span></p>
<p><span>KEY ZSERVERS PERSONNEL</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alexander Igorevich Mishin (Mishin)</strong>&nbsp;is a Russian national and administrator of Zservers. Mishin has marketed Zservers&rsquo; BPH services to cybercriminals, including LockBit affiliates and other ransomware groups, with the understanding that they would use those services in their cybercriminal activities. He has also directed virtual currency transactions to be made in support of those activities.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Aleksandr Sergeyevich Bolshakov (Bolshakov)</strong>&nbsp;is a Russian national and administrator of Zservers. In 2023, Bolshakov and Mishin shut down an IP address in response to a complaint from a Lebanese company alleging that a Zservers-associated IP address had implemented Lockbit in a ransomware attack. Zservers likely enabled ransomware attacks to continue by assigning a new IP address to the malicious Lockbit user. Mishin instructed Bolshakov to change the IP address of the malicious user and then told the Lebanese company that the original IP address was cut off.</span></p>
<p><span>OFAC is designating Mishin and Bolshakov pursuant to E.O. 13694, as further amended by<br />E.O. 14144, for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Zservers, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as further amended by E.O. 14144.</span></p>
<p><span>SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS</span></p>
<p><span>As a result of today&rsquo;s action, all property and interests in property of the blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC&rsquo;s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</span></p>
<p><span>Violations of OFAC regulations may result in civil or criminal penalties. OFAC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fofac.treasury.gov%2Fmedia%2F7566%2Fdownload%3Finline/1/01010194f51b6bb0-11746899-99c5-4d4d-af7e-1c804a2f3745-000000/z7_P5SposVmWNZ2CKpoVxf4iGXGP-jObwSOIS-eUhFU=391" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines</a>&nbsp;provide more information regarding OFAC&rsquo;s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext has announced a new&nbsp;</span><span>collaboration with Euroclear to support the development of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management services for repo and other asset classes.&nbsp;</span><span>The initiative is a major step to enable Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to expand its leading Italian repo clearing franchise to a large range of European government bonds bringing an efficient value offering to European and international clients.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Clearing will use Euroclear as its first triparty agent to enable enhanced collateral management capabilities. Leveraging on Euroclear&rsquo;s solutions, Euronext Clearing will offer clients automated, streamlined and flexible collateral solutions, improving operational efficiency and margin and balance sheet optimisation. Euroclear will act as an independent third party, managing the selection, valuation and substitution of collateral to ensure it meets eligibility criteria while optimising operational efficiency. It will also handle settlement and custody, provide regular reporting and ensure regulatory compliance, allowing clients to benefit from improved liquidity management and a reduced administrative burden.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The support of Euroclear&rsquo;s collateral management infrastructure, which handles an average in daily collateral, will strengthen Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s ability to deliver efficient, scalable services that address the evolving needs of its clients, with additional partnerships expected to further reinforce this approach.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This initiative builds on Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s unique position in the Italian repo market, where it already clears a significant portion of MTS repo activity, and lays the foundation for the next phase of the Euronext Clearing repo expansion to new European geographies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Clearing has undergone remarkable development in the last three years, evolving from a domestic central clearing house into the third-largest European clearing house. The integration of clearing operations across multiple geographies, diverse markets and various asset classes has solidified Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s position as a European leader.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Collaborating with Euroclear will pave the way for the rollout of Euronext&rsquo;s new repo clearing offering in June 2025, enabling the onboarding of clients including international banks, with an updated risk framework. Clients will be able to use Euroclear as a triparty agent for repo clearing.</span></p>

<title>SEC: Exemption From The Requirement To Report Certain Personally Identifiable Information To The Consolidated Audit Trail</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided an exemption from the requirement to report certain personally identifiable information (PII) &ndash; names, addresses, and years of birth &ndash; to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) for natural persons.&nbsp; Bad actors have become increasingly sophisticated and, in the event of a breach, may be able to use the names, addresses, and years of birth to impersonate a customer or broker-dealer and gain access to a customer&rsquo;s account. Providing an exemption from the requirement to report this PII to the CAT will help mitigate potential security risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over 12 years ago, the CAT was designed with the goal of creating a modernized audit trail system to enable regulators to analyze and reconstruct market events,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s exemptive order eliminates the requirement to report names, addresses, and years of birth for any U.S. natural person who trades in the stock market and recognizes that such information is not necessary to achieve CAT&rsquo;s objectives. Despite today&rsquo;s action, bad actors and other miscreants who engage in insider trading, market manipulation, and other schemes should be forewarned that the Commission has more than sufficient investigative tools to hold them accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Names, addresses, and years of birth were originally required to be collected in the CAT to facilitate the generation of unique anonymized customer IDs and to help regulators identify the person(s) responsible for a trade. In 2020, the Commission issued an order exempting the reporting of some of the most sensitive PII, including social security numbers. Today, the Commission issued an order exempting additional PII from the CAT. The CAT will still be able to generate reliable and consistent anonymized customer IDs even if such PII is not reported to the CAT.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On SEC’s Exemption From The Requirement To Report Certain Personally Identifiable Information To The Consolidated Audit Trail</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-38?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">exemption</a>&nbsp;from the requirement to report certain personally identifiable information to the Consolidated Audit Trail which was provided today by the Securities and Exchange Commission:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA applauds the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for taking this appropriate action to exempt the reporting of American investors&rsquo; personally identifiable information (PII) to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).&nbsp; For a decade, SIFMA has expressed strong concerns on behalf of the industry and investors that the information in the CAT&mdash;the largest database of retail and institutional trading ever created&mdash;was a ripe target for cyber criminals and collecting PII put investors&rsquo; data at risk.&nbsp; We have repeatedly called on the SEC to prohibit the collection of investors&rsquo; personal information and proposed alternatives that address the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement concerns without the need to collect such data.&nbsp; This bold decision by the Commission is entirely appropriate and long overdue.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Declawing The CAT: Statement On Consolidated Audit Trail Exemptive Relief, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Data are the foundation of advancement. They sit at the heart of innovation, technology, learning, community building, and so many other values crucial to our progress. Data can also be a critical tool in preventing fraud and wrongdoing.</p>
<p>But our data can also be deeply personal or subject to exploitation. That is why, when the government collects data, such collection must be done with due care and assurances that those who access our data are doing so with adequate guardrails and proper purpose. There must be processes and procedures followed to ensure responsible and appropriate use.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The fact that data are a powerful tool is not a reason to stop their collection altogether; rather, it is a reason to make use of data for significant and laudable goals&mdash;like protecting American business, investors, and the economy. We must weigh the law enforcement and regulatory benefits of the data collection against the potential costs.</p>
<p>The Consolidated Audit Trail (&ldquo;CAT&rdquo;) is a seminal example of how data collection can be used for good purpose. The CAT helps make our markets safer, more efficient, and can act as a powerful tool in ferreting out wrongdoing. Yet today, by eliminating critical data collection, we undermine its use and our own effectiveness. We are wiping away the fingerprints from the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>The agency adopted the CAT after the 2010 &ldquo;Flash Crash&rdquo; when U.S. markets collapsed and then partially rebounded in less than an hour.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The whiplash in prices undermined market confidence and caused significant investor losses.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;It was clear following the crash that regulators, including this agency, were unprepared to respond to a market event of that magnitude. A complete regulatory response would have required a full and robust analysis of data we did not have.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;It ultimately took the SEC nearly five months to determine the root causes of the crash,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and to this day, the Commission does not have a sense of who was harmed.</p>
<p>We must be more responsive than that. For quick and effective oversight in a crisis, regulators need access to a timely and comprehensive set of data&mdash;whether we are trying to figure out a major market event like the Flash Crash, investigate fraud, or identify suspicious foreign activity that may indicate market manipulation or infiltration. The CAT was designed to address outdated regulatory infrastructure by improving the completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of data needed to support robust regulatory oversight.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And, in fact, it has.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, today we eliminate the CAT&rsquo;s collection of the most basic customer identifying information,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;thus impairing regulators&rsquo; ability to understand suspicious activity, unwind events, or stave off market disruptions. Today&rsquo;s order itself acknowledges the negative impact this will have on regulatory efficiency but fails to grapple with the consequences of these diminished capabilities. It leaves unanswered the most basic questions. For example, will it be more difficult for regulators to spot fraud? How much harder will it be to identify certain types of market manipulation? Will it be more difficult to identify and address concerns relating to certain foreign ownership? Will it be more difficult to identify and compensate the victims of swindlers? In times of market disruption and ongoing fraud or manipulation, loss of time means loss of money and loss in market confidence. There is no question that this decision is a loss for markets and investor protection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Given that protecting the security and confidentiality of Consolidated Audit Trail data has long been a priority of the Commission, there are safeguards in place to protect this information. For example, Rule 613(e)(4)(i)(A) requires policies and procedures to ensure the security and confidentiality of all information reported to the CAT&rsquo;s central repository by requiring that the Participants and their employees agree to use appropriate safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of such data and agree not to use such data for any purpose other than surveillance and regulatory purposes. In addition, Rule 613(e)(4)(i)(B) requires the Participants adopt and enforce rules that require information barriers between regulatory staff and nonregulatory staff with regard to access and use of data in the central repository and permit only persons designated by plan sponsors to have access to the data in the central repository. Moreover, Rule 613(e)(4)(i)(C) requires that the Plan Processor develop and maintain a comprehensive information security program for the central repository, with dedicated staff, that is subject to regular reviews by the Chief Compliance Officer; have a mechanism to confirm the identity of all persons permitted to access the data; and maintain a record of all instances where such persons access the data.</p>

The Commission adopted Rule 613 to require self-regulatory organizations (&ldquo;SROs&rdquo;) to submit a national market system plan to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated order tracking system, or consolidated audit trail, with respect to the trading of NMS securities, that would capture customer and order event information for such securities, across all markets, from the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or execution ( the &ldquo;CAT Plan&rdquo; or &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;).

Although the SROs and the Commission quickly implemented a single-stock circuit breaker pilot program as an initial response, a more complete regulatory response required a full and robust analysis of additional data.

SEC staff encountered major problems that hindered their ability to figure out what happened during the Flash Crash, such as not being able to accurately sequence events across the multiple data sources or identify and eliminate duplicate orders.

<title>US Department Of Justice: Alabama Man Pleads Guilty In Connection With Securities And Exchange Commission X Account Hack</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-department-of-justice-alabama-man-pleads-guilty-in-connection-with-securitie-2025211/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Alabama man pleaded guilty today in connection with the January 2024 unauthorized takeover of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&rsquo;s social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which hackers posted a fraudulent message in the name of the then-SEC Chairman, temporarily causing the value of Bitcoin (BTC) to increase by more than $1,000.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Eric Council Jr., 25, of Athens, conspired with others who took unauthorized control of the SEC&rsquo;s X account and falsely announced that the SEC approved BTC Exchange Traded Funds, a decision highly anticipated by the market. Immediately following the false announcement, the price of BTC increased by more than $1,000 per bitcoin. Shortly after this unauthorized post, the SEC regained control over its X account and confirmed that the announcement was false and the result of a security breach. Following the correction, the value of BTC decreased by more than $2,000 per bitcoin.</p>
<p>The conspirators gained control of the SEC&rsquo;s X account through an unauthorized Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap carried out by Council. A SIM swap refers to the process of fraudulently inducing a cell phone carrier to reassign a cell phone number from the legitimate subscriber or user&rsquo;s SIM card to a SIM card controlled by a criminal actor. As part of the scheme, Council used an identification card printer to create a fraudulent identification card with a victim&rsquo;s personally identifiable information obtained from his co-conspirators. Council used the fraudulent identification card to impersonate the victim and gain access to the victim&rsquo;s cellular phone number for the purpose of accessing the SEC&rsquo;s account. Council&rsquo;s co-conspirators then accessed the account and posted in the name of the SEC Chairman. Council received payment in bitcoin from his co-conspirators for his role.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Council pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 16 and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>Supervisory Official Antoinette T. Bacon of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia; Special Agent in Charge Sean Ryan of the FBI Washington Field Office, Criminal and Cyber Division; and SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI Washington Field Office and SEC Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Ashley Pungello of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney Lauren Archer of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Rosenberg for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case. Substantial assistance was provided by Cyber Fellow Paul M. Zebb III.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham and Commissioners Kristin N. Johnson, Christy Goldsmith Romero and Summer K. Mersinger issued the following statement:</p>

<title>CFTC: ‘Dating Or Defrauding?’ A Joint Effort To Alert Online Daters, Social Media Users Of Relationship Investment Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In coordination with multiple federal, state, and nonprofit organizations, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach has launched&nbsp;a national awareness effort to alert the public to relationship investment scams targeting Americans through wrong-numbered texts, dating apps, and social media.<em></em></p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, the interagency&nbsp;<em>Dating or Defrauding?</em>&nbsp;social media awareness campaign will warn Americans to be skeptical of any request from online friends for cryptocurrency, gift cards, wire transfers, or other forms of payment. Other red flags include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A prolonged inability to meet in-person.<span></span></li>
<li>Moving conversations off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps.<span></span></li>
<li>Repeated suggestions for investments or requests for money.<span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The joint initiative will provide information about how to recognize relationship investment scams, what to do if you are affected, and why to share the information to warn others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, criminals are better able to hide their identities, create more fake profiles, phishing emails, and more convincing scam websites than ever before,&rdquo; said OCEO Director Melanie Devoe. &ldquo;Valentine&rsquo;s Day and the following weeks provide an excellent opportunity to remind people that criminals are using social media, dating, and messaging apps to scam Americans. We ask you to be alert, and to help stop scams by warning your friends and family.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the campaign, participating organizations will use the #DatingOrDefrauding hashtag and direct users to helpful resources. In addition to the CFTC, participating agencies include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal agencies</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>FBI, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Federal Trade Commission, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General, and&nbsp;<span>U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</span></li>
<li><strong>State agencies:</strong>&nbsp;Arizona Corporation Commission, U.S. Virgin Islands Office of the Lieutenant Governor, Oregon&nbsp;<span>Division of Financial Regulation</span>, Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, and Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.</li>
<li><span><strong>Non-governmental organizations:</strong>&nbsp;FINRA and NFA.&nbsp;</span><strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></p>
<p>Relationship investment scams are a recent type of romance fraud,&nbsp;<span>causing&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/annualreport/reports/2023_ic3report.pdf"><span>reported losses to the FBI&nbsp;</span></a><span>of nearly $4 billion in 2023.&nbsp;</span>Called pig butchering by the perpetrators, criminals use dating apps, social media platforms, messaging apps, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target possible victims. The scammers are known to use fake profiles, images, videos and voices to make themselves appear attractive and professional, and once introduced, they send frequent messages to build relationships. These new online &ldquo;friends&rdquo; claim to have made a lot of money trading cryptocurrency, precious metals, or foreign currency, thanks to special knowledge or insider help. The scammers talk about how easy it is and offer to help victims earn extra money. Victims are then directed to fraudulent trading platforms operated by the same organized criminal gangs.</p>
<p>These scams do not discriminate and have victimized people of all ages. People who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/isolated.html">live alone</a>&nbsp;or spend a lot of time on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/nothing_to_like_about_social_media_scammers.html">social media</a>&nbsp;or in discussion groups tend to be more vulnerable to fraud. Scams work because they appeal to unmet needs or emotions, like financial stress, excitement, or fear. The good news is that awareness can reduce victimization. Sharing information could help protect those closest to you.</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the&nbsp;<em>Dating or Defrauding?</em>&nbsp;effort, the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach is releasing a customer advisory<span>,&nbsp;</span><em>Help Warn Others About Relationship Investment Scams</em>, that explains the fraud in detail and steps the public can take to help others.</p>
<p>The CFTC has previously alerted customers to romance frauds including the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Dating or Defrauding?</em>&nbsp;campaign in 2022. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8491-22">8491-22</a>]. The CFTC also issued customer advisories&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CustomerAdvisory_RomanceScam.html">Avoid Forex, Precious Metals, and Digital Asset Romance Scams</a>. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8492-22">8492-22</a>] and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/RomanceScam.html">Six Warning Signs of Online Financial Romance Frauds</a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></span></p>
<p><span>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups.

<p class="text-align-center"><span><strong>Customer Advisory:&nbsp;Help Warn Others About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Scammers are using smart phones, social media or dating sites, and cryptocurrency to steal billions of dollars from Americans. Over the coming month, the CFTC is joining with other federal, state, and nonprofit organizations to raise awareness about these horrible crimes. You can help too: Warn your friends and family by sharing #DatingOrDefauding information and links.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Relationship investment scams, called&nbsp;</span><em>pig butchering</em><span>&nbsp;by the perpetrators, use dating apps, social media platforms,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/MessagingApps.html">messaging apps</a><span>, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target possible victims. The fraudsters use fake profiles, images, videos and voices to make them appear attractive and professional. Once introduced, they send frequent messages to build relationships. The new online &ldquo;friends&rdquo; claim to have made a lot of money trading cryptocurrency, precious metals, or foreign currency, thanks to special knowledge or insider help. The scammers talk about how easy it is and offer to help targets earn extra money. Targets are then directed to fraudulent trading platforms operated by the same organized criminal gangs.</span></p>
<p><span>Victims are told to convert their dollars to cryptocurrency and then send the crypto to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/SpotFraudSites.pdf">scam website</a><span>. They see their balances on the websites grow substantially and are encouraged to withdraw small amounts of money to spend on themselves. This is another ploy to build trust.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/node/253556">Research</a><span>&nbsp;reveals victims transfer an average of 10 payments, each larger than the last until they are financially drained.&nbsp;When victims try to make subsequent withdraws, they are refused or told they must pay additional fees or taxes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anyone Could be a Potential Victim</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Relationship investment scams do not discriminate and have victimized people of all ages. People who&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/isolated.html">live alone</a><span>&nbsp;or spend a lot of time on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/nothing_to_like_about_social_media_scammers.html">social media</a><span>&nbsp;or in discussion groups tend to be more vulnerable to fraud. Scams work because they appeal to unmet needs or emotions, like financial stress, excitement, or fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The good news is that awareness about specific scams can reduce victimization by up to 85 percent.</span><a href="https://gbc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/wordeditorframe.aspx?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;wopisrc=https%3A%2F%2Fcftcusgov.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2Fopa%2F_vti_bin%2Fwopi.ashx%2Ffiles%2F005115727ac249a19617084f11da42aa&amp;wdlor=c85BDB46C-9A0A-410E-8A30-DB17F1DC4390&amp;wdenableroaming=1&amp;mscc=1&amp;hid=A89B2267-1A92-4C45-99D7-A465B887A5FC.0&amp;uih=sharepointcom&amp;wdlcid=en-US&amp;jsapi=1&amp;jsapiver=v2&amp;corrid=41504e13-2491-b825-495a-c7568e9d28e6&amp;usid=41504e13-2491-b825-495a-c7568e9d28e6&amp;newsession=1&amp;sftc=1&amp;uihit=docaspx&amp;muv=1&amp;cac=1&amp;sams=1&amp;mtf=1&amp;sfp=1&amp;sdp=1&amp;hch=1&amp;hwfh=1&amp;dchat=1&amp;sc=%7B%22pmo%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fcftcusgov.sharepoint.com%22%2C%22pmshare%22%3Atrue%7D&amp;ctp=LeastProtected&amp;rct=Normal&amp;wdorigin=Outlook-Body.Sharing.ServerTransfer.LOF&amp;wdhostclicktime=1738172007109&amp;csc=1&amp;instantedit=1&amp;wopicomplete=1&amp;wdredirectionreason=Unified_SingleFlush#_ftn1"><span><span>[1]</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;Sharing information during the Dating or Defrauding Campaign could help protect those closest to you.</span></p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders Florida Man To Pay Over $7.6 Million For Digital Asset Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a consent order against&nbsp;<strong>Randall Crater</strong>&nbsp;of Heathrow, Florida.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The order requires Crater to pay over $</span><span>7.6 million&nbsp;</span><span>in restitution to defrauded victims in connection with his digital asset fraud scheme, with dollar-for-dollar credit for restitution payments to victims in satisfaction of the restitution ordered in a parallel criminal action. The order also imposes a permanent injunction against Crater and bans him from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets, entering into any transactions involving commodity interests or digital asset commodities, and registering with the CFTC.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The consent order finds from at least January 2014 through January 2018, Crater, together with other defendants named in CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint, operated a digital asset scheme in which they fraudulently offered the sale of a fully functioning virtual currency,&nbsp;<strong>My Big Coin</strong>, a commodity in interstate commerce.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Crater obtained more than $7.6 million from at least 28 customers through fraudulent solicitations, including false and misleading claims and omissions about MBC&rsquo;s value, use and trade status, and that MBC was backed by gold. He spent the misappropriated money to purchase, among other things, a home, antiques, fine art, jewelry, and other luxury goods.</span></p>
<p><span>The consent order resolves the claims against Crater in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against him and co-defendants&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Mark Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., John Roche, and Michael Kruger</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;[See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7678-18"><span>7678-18</span></a><span>.] The enforcement action remains pending against the co-defendants.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>On Jan. 18, 2022, a grand jury returned an eight-count superseding indictment charging Crater with wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business based on the same conduct alleged in CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint. [</span><em><span>United States v. Randall Crater</span></em><span>, No. 1:19-cr-10063-DJC (D. Mass. Jan. 18, 2022)).] Crater was found guilty of those charges on July 21, 2022, and was sentenced to over eight years in prison and ordered to pay $7.6 million in restitution to defrauded customers and to forfeit&nbsp;</span><a name="_Hlk176509289"><span>$7.6 million,</span></a><span>&nbsp;which represented the proceeds he received from his violations.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, and the FBI.</span></p>
<p><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Jonah E. McCarthy, Patricia Gomersall, Daniel Ullman II, Paul G. Hayeck, and former staff members Jason Mahoney, John Einstman, Kyong J. Koh, and Hillary Van Tassel.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered an order against&nbsp;<strong>Rashawn Russell,&nbsp;</strong>a New York resident, in a CFTC action charging Russell with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation of investor assets obtained for the purported purpose of trading digital assets on behalf of customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order requires Russell to pay over $1.5 million in restitution to defrauded victims. The order also permanently enjoins Russell from engaging in conduct that violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, permanently bans him from registering with the CFTC and from solicitation for and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets on behalf of third parties, and bans him from trading for himself for a period of eight years. The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s action against Russell.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8686-23">8686-23</a>]<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The order, stemming from a CFTC complaint filed April 11, 2023, finds from November 2020 to August 2022 Russell engaged in a fraudulent digital assets trading scheme in which he solicited more than two dozen retail customers to contribute bitcoin, ether, and fiat currency to invest in his purported proprietary digital assets trading fund. The order further finds Russell intentionally and/or recklessly made false and misleading statements regarding the fund&rsquo;s structure, size, and performance to obtain and retain investors; failed to trade the money and assets as represented; and, falsely promised to pay withdrawal requests.

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.validusrm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Validus Risk Management</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Validus&rdquo;), a leading software and tech-enabled services platform for financial risk management, today announced that it has secured a $45 million growth equity investment from&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://ftvcapital.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FTV Capital</a>, a sector-focused growth equity firm with a successful track record of investing in enterprise and financial technology. The minority investment will enable Validus to accelerate its go-to-market efforts, further expand into the United States and APAC while continuing to penetrate the European market, and invest in technology and product innovation.</p>
<p>The global market for alternative assets has grown at an approximately 12% CAGR for the last decade to over $13 trillion of assets under management in 2024. As private markets evolve and become more complex, investment firms increasingly demand specialized technology and services to manage market risks, optimize internal processes and seek operational efficiencies. Combining award-winning technology, expert resources and a deep understanding of private markets, Validus delivers innovative software and tech-enabled solutions to fund managers across private debt, private equity, secondaries, infrastructure and real estate. Validus serves over 750 funds globally whose managers have $3.2 trillion in combined assets under management, and the company has consistently demonstrated profitability, with significant year-on-year recurring revenue growth.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment,&nbsp;<b>Kevin Lester, co-founder and chief executive officer at Validus, said</b>, &ldquo;For the past 15 years, our relentless commitment to excellence has been the foundation of our success. We are proud to serve some of the world&rsquo;s largest private capital managers, while maintaining a culture that never stands still. Innovation drives us&mdash;whether through designing customized hedging strategies or developing technology that streamlines operations, mitigates risk, and enhances efficiency for our clients. With the backing of FTV Capital, we are poised to scale faster and deliver even greater value to our growing client base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The global alternative asset industry is massive and growing, yet risk management has been largely overlooked,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Mike Cichowski, partner at FTV Capital.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Validus fills this gap in the market, delivering a comprehensive platform and innovative technology solutions that not only address risk management but also drive operational efficiencies in the middle-office. Validus has demonstrated its success and potential, consistently growing market share profitably and proving itself as the solution of choice for many of the world&rsquo;s leading private capital firms. We&rsquo;re thrilled to lead this investment and look forward to partnering with Kevin and the Validus team to accelerate the company&rsquo;s growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Haakon Blakstad, chief commercial officer at Validus, added,</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;In addition to FTV&rsquo;s track record in financial services and technology, we were impressed with their understanding of our particular sector and enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead. Our partnership is about far more than capital; we believe that the strategic support, operating resources and network that FTV will provide are worth many times more than the investment itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of this investment, Cichowski will join the Validus board of directors. Walter Global Asset Management will remain on the board as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.</p>

<p>The Tender Offers are being made upon the terms and subject to conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, dated&nbsp;February 10, 2025&nbsp;(as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the &ldquo;Offer to Purchase&rdquo;), which sets forth a detailed description of the Tender Offers. The Company reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase or decrease any or all of the Series Notes Caps and/or the Aggregate Notes Cap in its sole discretion at any time without extending or reinstating withdrawal rights, subject to compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>The Tender Offers for the Notes will expire at&nbsp;5:00 p.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;March 11, 2025, or any other date and time to which the Company extends the applicable Tender Offer (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the &ldquo;Expiration Date&rdquo;), unless earlier terminated. Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at&nbsp;5:00 p.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;February 24, 2025&nbsp;(such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the &ldquo;Early Tender Date&rdquo;), and the holder&rsquo;s Notes must be accepted for purchase, to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below). If a holder validly tenders Notes after the applicable Early Tender Date but prior to or at the applicable Expiration Date, and the holder&rsquo;s Notes are accepted for purchase, the holder will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below).</p>
<p>Subject to the Aggregate Notes Cap, the Series Notes Caps and proration, if applicable, the total consideration for each&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;principal amount of the Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to each Tender Offer will be calculated in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable Fixed Spread for such Notes specified in the table above plus the applicable yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at&nbsp;10:00 a.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;February 25, 2025 (excluding Accrued Interest with respect to each series of Notes, the &ldquo;Total Consideration&rdquo;).&nbsp;The Total Consideration includes an applicable early tender premium per&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase as set forth in the table above (with respect to each series of Notes, the &ldquo;Early Tender Premium&rdquo;).

<p>In addition to the consideration described above, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes to, but not including, the applicable settlement date (&ldquo;Accrued Interest&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Company intends to fund the purchase of validly tendered and accepted Notes with available cash on hand and other sources of liquidity. The purpose of the Tender Offers is to purchase a portion of the Notes, subject to the Aggregate Notes Cap and the Series Notes Caps, in order to reduce the Company&rsquo;s total outstanding public debt.</p>
<p>The Tender Offers will expire on the applicable Expiration Date. Except as set forth below, payment for the Notes that are validly tendered prior to or at the Expiration Date and that are accepted for purchase will be made on a date promptly following the Expiration Date, which is currently anticipated to be&nbsp;March 14, 2025, the third business day after the Expiration Date.

</p>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good morning and thank you so much for joining us. Today we are here to discuss recent changes we have made to the Bank of England&rsquo;s (the Bank&rsquo;s) regulatory and supervisory frameworks for Financial Market Infrastructure (FMIs) and our priorities for FMI regulation this year.</p>
<p>We are in a time, and in a sector, of sweeping technological advances, posing exciting opportunities to innovate within, and grow, the UK economy. As FMIs and regulators, we need to seize these opportunities, while understanding and mitigating the risks that come with them. In a context of heightened geopolitical tensions, embracing opportunities to find new, more effective ways of working, while ensuring FMIs&rsquo; resilience has never been more crucial.</p>
<p>Our priorities for the year will help you deliver on that ambition. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient.</li>
<li>Safe and sustainable innovation.</li>
<li>Financial resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient. Cyber and third-party providers pose some of the most significant risks here that need managing. Our policies set the framework for achieving resilience and we will be looking at firms&rsquo; progress carefully in line with the March deadline.</p>
<p>Safe and sustainable innovation. We want you to embrace the benefits that innovation offers, while managing the risks it poses. For our part, we will ensure our regulatory and supervisory frameworks facilitate innovation while maintaining financial stability.</p>
<p>Financial resilience. While we&rsquo;ve had the benefit of relative market stability recently, especially compared to previous years, we can&rsquo;t take our eye off financial resilience. For central counterparties (CCPs) we will use stress testing and other tools to monitor and probe risks, improve transparency and target mitigation.</p>
<p>To achieve these priorities, we need to continue to work openly and cooperatively together to mitigate risks, embrace innovation, and safely provide the critical infrastructure on which the economy relies.</p>
<h3>Why FMIs matter and our desired outcomes</h3>
<p>UK FMIs are essential to the global financial system. Every time an individual or business makes a transaction, your firms work behind the scenes to ensure it is processed smoothly, reducing and managing risk, particularly during periods of stress. The scale of this work is immense.</p>
<p>Day in, day out, CCPs clear trillions of pounds worth of contracts, the UK&rsquo;s central security depository, Euroclear UK &amp; International (EUI) settles nearly a trillion pounds of securities transactions, and our payment systems process countless retail and wholesale transactions. Confidence in FMI services is critical to a vibrant and prosperous economy, facilitating growth by allowing other businesses, individuals and financial market participants to transact and take informed risk safely.</p>
<p>While you deliver these services, it&rsquo;s the Bank&rsquo;s role to provide a regulatory and supervisory framework that ensures financial stability while facilitating innovation and supporting the wider economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-remarks-chair-ceo-ineds-roundtable-for-uk-financial-market-infrastructure-firms#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Our common goal of financially and operationally resilient FMIs delivering trusted services is best met when we work together, with an open dialogue, and an understanding of each other&rsquo;s needs and constraints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is a consequence we need to acknowledge; in managing risk, FMIs centralise it. Disruption or operational outages at an FMI can trigger severe financial instability and economic consequences, especially given that the participants of FMIs are often systemically important institutions that rely on FMIs for their proper functioning, and in the case of UK CCPs, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) such as large banks. CCPs play a crucial role supporting trading and management of counterparty risk, while central security depositories (CSDs) ensure securities settle on time and play an important role in the liquidity and collateral chain. And payment systems are key to liquidity, supporting wholesale and retail payments across all sectors of the economy. What is clear is that any significant disruption to the operation of FMIs could rapidly escalate into broader financial and economic turmoil and a corresponding loss in confidence in the financial system. While thankfully it didn&rsquo;t severely impact your firms, last summer&rsquo;s Crowdstrike incident demonstrated the risks and importance of our work on operational resilience, outsourcing and third-party suppliers, to ensure firms take action ahead of time to identify risks to delivery of their critical services and make themselves resilient to disruption.</p>
<p>If we look back further, history offers a stark reminder of how costly financial crises can be. The 2008 financial crisis was the most significant growth-destroying event in recent memory, but also highlighted the value of FMIs in reducing risk. This was dramatically illustrated through the difference in the ease with which the creditors of the failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers were able to deal with the losses arising from its cleared derivatives portfolio, using collateral the firm had deposited at the CCPs it used, against the years they spent dealing with losses from uncleared positions.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-remarks-chair-ceo-ineds-roundtable-for-uk-financial-market-infrastructure-firms#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;This relative success of CCPs during the crisis is part of what has made them such a central node of the financial system today. Supporting FMIs in playing this role in reducing risk, and ultimately avoiding a repeat of such a crisis, is the most important contribution we can make to sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a more shock prone world, with elevated volatility in part driven by geopolitical stress, it is critical that FMIs are aware of the potential risks they can create as they manage their own risks and the risks of other firms. Supported by the Bank of England,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/boe-and-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission">the international community has responded to risks around procyclicality of margin calls</a>, through new standards on margin transparency at CCPs which aim to improve centrally cleared market participants&rsquo; understanding of potential future margin requirements and margin responsiveness, helping to reduce the risk of severe procyclical effects in times of market volatility.</p>
<h3>Innovation: Playing our respective roles in embracing responsible innovation</h3>
<p>There has also been a step change in opportunities and risks arising from technological advances and we are committed to working with you to ensure we can embrace these opportunities safely. For payments, technological innovations are changing the landscape for providers, driven in large part by broader changes in what consumers expect. These advances will bring business opportunities and efficiencies as well as risks that need to be understood and managed. When safely implemented, they can also be used to help ensure resilience at FMIs, for instance through the huge potential in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to help monitor market activity and risk.</p>
<p>We need to work together to manage the risks and, importantly, make the most of the opportunities. As FMIs you will need to adapt your risk management strategies and business models to navigate this new environment effectively while making the most of the technological advances that could enable a step change in the services you provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits could be realised by bringing new technologies to existing firms (for example, through tokenisation or the introduction of atomic settlement) or through new types of FMIs joining the payments, settlement and clearing sectors. These technological advances are a good thing &ndash; but the risks need managing. We are keen to hear from you both on how you are innovating and the benefits that this is bringing, and any risks you see being created.</p>
<p>In line with our secondary objective to facilitate innovation, the Bank of England&rsquo;s role is to give you space to innovate in a way that protects financial stability. Our role in facilitating innovation can be both as catalyst, allowing safe experimentation through initiatives such as the Digital Securities Sandbox, but also by getting out of the way. Removing barriers allows your firms or new players to innovate to improve FMI services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also opportunities in RegTech allowing us to do our job more effectively, including to process approvals more efficiently. Increases in computing power and application of techniques like machine learning may also allow us to perform desk-based assessments of firm resilience that are higher frequency and wider in scope &ndash; for example, more regular stress tests against a wider range of scenarios.</p>
<h3>What we have done so far&nbsp;on our priorities</h3>
<p>Over the past year, the Bank has taken critical steps to evolve its approach with new powers and responsibilities in mind, while maintaining a robust commitment to financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have laid the groundwork for an FMI rulebook, through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/cp/fundamental-rules-for-financial-market-infrastructures">proposed Fundamental Rules</a>. This is an important and substantive area of work for the Bank to progress and clarify the outcomes we will require FMIs to meet. They are intended to drive board-level discussions about these outcomes and how firms can achieve them, supporting both our financial stability and innovation objectives.</p>
<p>We also refreshed our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/financial-market-infrastructure-supervision/what-do-we-do/the-bank-of-englands-approach-to-financial-market-infrastructure-supervision">approach to supervision</a>. Our supervisory approach is now more proportionate and risk-based, giving us greater flexibility to focus on the firms and issues that pose the greatest risks to our objectives, and providing us with more flexibility to choose to not intervene when we consider the costs outweigh the benefits. It also better accommodates the new and emerging risks that we see for FMIs.</p>
<p>In keeping with the thinking behind the Fundamental Rules, the supervisory approach will help ensure firms consider and reflect on the impact they can have on the financial system and the real economy in their decision making. Our new approach also ensures firms are prepared to work with the authorities in times of severe disruption.</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, we have made significant strides. We launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/november/operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-to-the-uk-financial-sector-policy-statement">Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime</a>&nbsp;and introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/cp/operational-resilience-operational-incident-and-outsourcing-and-third-party-reporting-for-fmis">proposals for operational incident and outsourcing reporting</a>, both of which help to ensure that the sectors&rsquo; operational resilience remains robust in the face of new challenges.&nbsp;We&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/stress-testing/2024/2024-ccp-supervisory-stress-test-results-report">stress-tested the financial resilience of CCPs</a>&nbsp;and contributed to international work on margin transparency.</p>
<p>We are also working with&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;to ensure your systems and processes are operationally resilient, given the end-of-March deadline for FMIs, to show us that they can remain within their impact tolerances when the critical services they offer are disrupted. You have been engaged in this work, with wargames, collaborative risk meetings and initiatives such as the Cross Market Operational Resilience Group.</p>
<p>Clearly there&rsquo;s more work for FMIs to do ahead of the end-March deadline. While this is a significant milestone, it is not the last piece of the puzzle. FMIs will need to continue to improve operational resilience as risks and technologies evolve. And be mindful of risks that could be posed by the process of introducing significant changes to the technology they use. Cyber threat actors who seek to harm the financial system will not stop developing their techniques, so FMIs need to remain vigilant to the changing threats they are exposed to. We as regulators need to work to ensure our requirements and guidance respond to those risks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s to come?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I wanted to return here to the three priorities that I set out at the start, building things out in a bit more detail.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk189149110"></a>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient: This remains a cornerstone of our work, and only grows in importance as geopolitical volatility increases. As well as working with you through the approaching deadline to meet our required standards, we will be focussing on embedding our oversight regime for CTPs and engaging with you on our operational incident and outsourcing requirements. We also plan to develop more detailed guidance to formalise our expectations on cyber resilience, in line with increased sophistication and risk of cyber events. This would have the aim of FMIs improving their ability to identify and prevent cyber incidents, advancing their capacity to test their resilience against potential incidents, and importantly detecting, responding, and recovering in a safe manner if defences are breached.</p>
<p>Facilitating safe and resilient innovation in payments, settlement and clearing: Through initiatives such as the Digital Securities Sandbox and the digital gilt (or DIGIT), we are focussed on facilitating innovation across payments, settlement and clearing in a way that drives growth while protecting financial stability. We are also implementing international standards for systemic stablecoins and will support innovation and enhancements within existing FMI services. As part of our work with HM Treasury (HMT) to repeal UK European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) for CCPs and replace it with Bank rules and relevant statutory provisions, together we are considering how we could simplify certain processes, such as for approving CCP margin models and authorising new products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring stability through financially resilient FMIs:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>For CCPs, we will propose rules to repeal EMIR and replace it with an adaptable and dynamic rulebook that aligns with evolving international standards, particularly on margin transparency. We will also engage with firms to further understand how changes in the clearing landscape impact your risk profile. We will also improve our use of data to monitor risks to financial and operational resilience.</p>
<p>Across all of this work, we will continue to improve our engagement with you &ndash; the FMIs we regulate. This year, we will finalise our Fundamental Rules after consultation &ndash; making clear our requirements across our regulatory priorities. Initiatives like the Fundamental Rules and our refreshed Supervisory Approach are part of this effort. However, we also want to find out how we can help you embrace innovative technologies and make sure that we are ready for the challenges ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With your help, we can seize the opportunities provided by both recent technological advances and our new powers and responsibilities to ensure:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>UK FMIs can thrive domestically and internationally, support growth through effective risk management, innovate safely and enhance resilience;</li>
<li>our Supervisory Approach remains strong and effective, is risk-based and flexible, and relevant to the shifting landscape of risks you engage with every day;</li>
<li>our regulatory framework balances high standards and certainty with the agility to address change, with rules that are clear and accessible, and supervisory actions that are outcomes focussed; and</li>
<li>we have a productive and open dialogue between regulators and industry with a &lsquo;no surprises&rsquo; culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This vision is ambitious, but it is achievable with your engagement and collaboration. Thank you for your work so far in realising this vision, and for your invaluable contributions to this vital sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to thank James Hoskins, Richard Spooner, Joe Irwin, Sadia Arif, Charlotte Kelly, Barry King, Justin Jacobs, Simon Morley, Shane Scott, Sarah Breeden, Michael Yoganayagam and Harsh Mehta for their contribution to these remarks.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For January 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-january-2025-2025210/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s inaugural address for his second presidency reverberated through both U.S. and international markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast stronger U.S. economic growth while cautioning that dramatic policy shifts could create headwinds for other economies and complicate monetary easing efforts by central banks worldwide. In the aftermath, U.S. treasury yields pushed higher as the dollar extends its rally.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>noted that the heavy concentration of U.S. market capitalization in a handful AI-technology stocks presents vulnerability to a major correction. Given the policy uncertainty, the Federal Reserve (Fed) may move toward monetary easing sooner than anticipated. This scenario could catalyze capital outflows from the U.S. market to emerging economies, with Thailand's stock market emerging as an attractive destination due to its low volatility, evidenced by the SET Index's end-of-day volatility. The Thai stock market's additional strength is the consistently strong dividend yield, with Thai stocks maintaining an average yield of 3.14 percent since 2000 to date. The Thai stock market thus positions itself as a compelling safe haven for investors pursuing defensive portfolio diversification.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for January</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of January 2025, the SET Index fell by 6.1 percent to close at 1,314.50 points. </li>
<li>Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Financials and Energy. </li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in January 2025 decreased 17.2 percent YoY to THB 39.01 billion (approx. USD 1.16 billion). However, local institutional investors' trading proportion demonstrated an upward trend, staying above 10 percent of total trading value for four consecutive months. </li>
<li>In January, there was one newly listed company on mai, namely Pro Inside pcl (PIS).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of January 2025 was 15.0 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.6 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.7 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 14.2 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of January 2025 was 3.64 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.28 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in January 2025 averaged 391,493 contracts, down 27.3 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 dropped 27.3 percent to 391,493 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<title>WFE FY24 Market Data: Americas Region Leading Global Markets Despite Lowest Level Of IPOs Worldwide In The Last 5 Years</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New data published by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, shows the buoyancy of the Americas region, which continues to lead global markets despite the lowest level of IPOs worldwide in the last 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of IPOs globally fell to the lowest level in the last 5 years, driven by the APAC and EMEA regions, but the number of IPOs in the Americas increased.</li>
<li>The Americas and APAC regions reached record trading volumes and market capitalisation, whilst EMEA declined across both indicators.</li>
<li>The Americas region&nbsp;reached its highest market capitalisation in the last 5 years, driven mostly by gains in tech stocks.</li>
<li>The funds raised through IPOs in the Americas and EMEA regions rose, 91% and 61% respectively.</li>
<li>The capital raised globally through IPOs recorded a slight downtick on 2023, due mainly to the APAC region which raised the lowest amount in the last five years despite hosting the largest IPO globally, Midea Group.</li>
<li>Though we saw fewer IPOs globally, the average size of an IPO increased by 7.6% compared to 2023, and the number of IPOs raising over USD$1bn more than doubled year on year. In 2023 these IPOs added USD$16.14bn to capital markets, whilst in 2024 they reached USD$36.40bn.</li>
<li>The data shows that overall, the average trading size was at its lowest in the last 5 years, suggesting that more retail investors were active in the market. The Americas bucked this trend, recording its largest average trade size in the last 5 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE commented,</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Investors turn to public markets to finance the future. As we start 2025, it's crucial for new Governments and policymakers worldwide to reaffirm their commitment to keeping these markets dynamic. We need to see policies that not only foster investment in transparent, well-regulated markets, but also empower and encourage businesses to list and access essential capital for growth.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE commented,</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The data reflects the persistence of geopolitical tensions and uncertainty derived from elections. In 2024 we also saw substantive changes in monetary policy around the world. Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions will remain a key driver of capital markets, and determiner of business confidence, IPO activity, and investor sentiment. By the half year, the data should show the impact of US policy developments on market performance globally. Longer-term, the patterns we are starting to see in how technological advancements are impacting market composition and growth, could become starker.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Key data points:</strong><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>These FX capabilities are now available via 360T&rsquo;s platform, enabling users to deploy them across highly curated disclosed or anonymous liquidity pools, putting multiple counterparties in competition to help ensure best execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to announce this partnership with QB and are confident that providing access to highly sophisticated FX algos from an independent specialist provider, as additional tools alongside the broad range of bank offered algos already available via 360T, will provide significant benefits to our diverse and global client base,&rdquo; said Matt O&rsquo;Hara, CEO of 360T Americas.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;This partnership also delivers on Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s strategic vision to bring together highly complementary technology solutions from independently operating providers within the organisation to create a truly differentiated offering and further accelerate growth, while also fully aligning with 360T&rsquo;s commitment to constant innovation in FX.&rdquo;</p>

<title>The Complex Challenge Of Advice - Speech By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Conexus Financial Professional Planner 2025 Advice Policy Summit, 10 February 2025.</title>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Financial advisers are entrusted by their clients to help them make confident and informed decisions. In many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</span></li>
<li><span>ASIC has observed some positive signs of improvement &ndash; but there continues to be too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers</span>.</li>
<li><span>In light of some of these poor practices, &lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo; and &lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo; have been selected as 2025 enforcement priorities</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning everyone.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal people as the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we are gathering today &ndash; and by paying my respects to their elders past, present and emerging and extending that respect to any First Nations people with us here today.</p>
<p>One of ASIC&rsquo;s core functions is to promote the confident and informed participation of consumers and investors in our financial system &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why I was pleased to accept this invitation to speak at this Advice Policy Summit.</p>
<p>Not everybody needs or seeks advice to support their participation in the financial system. But when they do, it&rsquo;s important that they have access to good quality advice that meets their needs and is delivered with independence and integrity.</p>
<p>While that&rsquo;s a simple objective, achieving it is not easy.</p>
<p>As is clear from ASIC&rsquo;s work over many years, the complexity of the financial system, the range of products and business models, the interconnected nature of some of those, and indeed the range of knowledge and capacity that people bring when they engage with the system, make consumer protection and financial advice a complex challenge.</p>
<p>Sometimes this results in very complex legislation, as I know you&rsquo;re all aware of. And sometimes that is helpful. But we&rsquo;re also increasingly conscious that sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>Complexity can often be an obstacle to compliance, and to effective regulation. In our experience, the simpler a set of rules, the more enforceable they are. That&rsquo;s not just good for consumers and investors. It&rsquo;s also good for businesses and professionals, who get greater clarity about what&rsquo;s required of them.</p>
<p>And while the legislative framework is a matter for the Government, we&lsquo;re conscious that we administer a complex range of regulatory guidance and legislative instruments. With a significant amount of that focusing on the requirements that apply to people involved in the provision of financial advice.</p>
<p>In November last year, our Chair Joe Longo announced the creation of a Simplification Consultative Group, to advise ASIC on what we can do, within our powers, to address this issue of complexity. We will be seeking your views on this work during 2025. So if it&rsquo;s an issue of interest to you, I encourage you to keep an eye out for further announcements in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But returning to the topic of today&rsquo;s forum, advice policy, I&rsquo;d like to start by talking about ASIC&rsquo;s role in policy &ndash; in general and also in relation to the advice-related reforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll then share some reflections on what we are seeing in terms of the quality of advice.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll finish with some notes on what you can expect to see from ASIC over the next year, given our priorities.</p>
<h2>Policy: preparation, implementation and compliance</h2>
<p>So, first to ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to policy.</p>
<p>ASIC doesn&rsquo;t make policy decisions. Nor do we design regulatory reform. That&rsquo;s the role of the Government, guided by advice from Treasury, with Parliament, of course, making the ultimate decision on any changes to legislation.</p>
<p>ASIC does, of course, assist Treasury through that process. But our role really comes into play once legislative reforms have passed, where we&rsquo;ve got an important role in helping industry to understand what the new requirements mean for them, and how to comply with them. And, obviously, a key way in which we do this is through producing regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>The Delivering Better Financial Outcomes (DBFO) reforms provide the most recent examples of this work. As you know, and we&rsquo;ve already talked about this morning, it&rsquo;s being rolled out in a series of tranches. And through this process, we&rsquo;ve been liaising with industry &ndash; through various professional associations, through our supervisory work and stakeholder forums, including our own Financial Adviser Consultative Panel.</p>
<p>Coming from that work, in October and November we released &ndash; following the passage of the first tranche &ndash; a suite of new and updated regulatory guidance and other supporting information. And we continue to seek input from stakeholders on the content of our regulatory guidance, some of which may result in further updates to that guidance. And as further reforms are legislated, we&rsquo;ll continue through that process.</p>
<p>Similarly, with the introduction of professional standards for financial advisers, we continue to update our guidance &ndash; and we&rsquo;ll no doubt be doing that further as a result of some announcements earlier today. This, to date, includes information about the impact of the reforms, timeframes for compliance and the requirements for accessing different pathways.</p>
<p>As reforms begin to take effect, industry participants sometimes encounter practical issues that are raised with us, often by industry groups. We&rsquo;re always really keen to listen to those concerns and, where it&rsquo;s appropriate and within our powers, we&rsquo;re willing to consider taking action to support the intent of the relevant reforms.</p>
<p>As an example, following industry concerns about the practical implications of the changes to Financial Services Guide (FSG) requirements, we registered a legislative instrument late last year, which broadened the use of website disclosure. So that it can be used in relation to dealing in a financial product for the purposes of implementing financial product advice, as well as for the advice itself. And I know that was something that was welcomed by many around the industry.</p>
<p>Of course, once legislation is in place, we also then shift focus to monitoring compliance &ndash; and one of the key ways in which we do that is through thematic reviews.</p>
<p>These typically involve selecting a selection of advisers and licensees, gathering data and information to help us to assess levels of compliance with particular legislative provisions. We then publish our findings, highlighting good practices and areas for improvement to assist the sector and drive further compliance.</p>
<p>And a good example of this from the past year would be Report 779, which examined the role of super trustees, financial advisers and licensees in relation to choice superannuation products &ndash; which I discussed at another Conexus event late last year which I know a number of you were present at [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>].</p>
<p>Then the other key aspect of our role is, of course, enforcement. Where we see serious non-compliance &ndash; which might be something we identify through our thematic reviews, it might be through reportable situations, it might be through reports of misconduct that come directly to us from members of the public &ndash; we may refer that misconduct for investigation, which can, of course, lead to litigation by ASIC or referral to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for potential prosecution.</p>
<p>We provide clear guidance to industry about our priorities, the areas of focus in our enforcement work, through annual enforcement priorities, which I&rsquo;ll discuss a bit later.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s view on the quality of advice</h2>
<p>Before speaking about our priorities for the next year, Conexus invited me to make a few comments about what we&rsquo;re seeing in terms of the quality of advice and whether it&rsquo;s improved, given the reforms of recent years.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, we&rsquo;ve seen some positive indications through work that ASIC has done. That includes the work that we did on the Life Insurance Framework Review, where we saw a significant improvement in the quality of advice between 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>And although the scope and findings of that work were limited to life insurance advice, some of our observations from the review and input from industry stakeholders suggest that several factors have influenced an improvement in standards of advice in parts of the industry.</p>
<p>They, of course, include the adviser education standards and improved focus by licensees on the best interests duty, and the adoption of some of the recommendations that we made in 2017, following a review of how large institutions were overseeing advisers [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-515-financial-advice-review-of-how-large-institutions-oversee-their-advisers/" title="REP 515 Financial advice: Review of how large institutions oversee their advisers">REP 515</a>].</p>
<p>We also observed, in that work, that record-keeping across client advice files had materially improved. And that&rsquo;s important because record-keeping helps demonstrate compliance, and it&rsquo;s long been an area of focus for ASIC and will continue to be so.</p>
<h2>Areas of concern</h2>
<p>At the same time, however, we continue to see too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers.</p>
<p>Our ongoing investigation into the Shield Master Fund is one such example &ndash; though regrettably it&rsquo;s not an isolated one. It reflects a pattern of conduct we are seeing all too frequently.</p>
<p>This pattern commonly involves telemarketers recruiting consumers before passing them onto advisers. These advisers then recommend that consumers withdraw their superannuation savings from a regulated fund and invest them, sometimes via an SMSF (self-managed super fund), into a high-risk property scheme or some other high-risk investment.</p>
<p>Our Deputy Chair Sarah Court has described some of this misconduct as occurring &lsquo;at industrial scale&rsquo;. And this can result in the significant erosion &ndash; or complete loss &ndash; of a person&rsquo;s retirement savings. And while there is often a complex web of individuals and entities involved, inappropriate or poor-quality advice typically plays a pivotal role in the ultimate consumer outcomes.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s priorities</h2>
<p>Those comments are a bit of a backdrop to some of our priorities for the current year, which I&rsquo;ll talk about now. I&rsquo;ll talk about our strategic priorities and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>We have five longer-term&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/our-role/our-vision-and-strategic-priorities/" title="Our vision and strategic priorities">strategic priorities</a>&nbsp;but there are two in particular that I&rsquo;ll call out as having an impact on advice.</p>
<p>The first is to&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;improve consumer outcomes&rsquo;</strong>. And this includes our work in a range of areas, such as predatory sales tactics, design and distribution obligations and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>And I would like to particularly highlight the work on dispute resolution. We, of course, now receive data on a six-monthly basis on firms&rsquo; internal dispute resolution. We have made it clear that we will be publishing firm-level data from that data collection during the course of 2025.</p>
<p>Late last year, we published a higher-level overview of what we were seeing from the initial data collection, with some observations around some of the data quality issues. And, I guess, I mention that because with firm-level publication coming, firms have got an opportunity to really focus on how to improve the quality of their data before that becomes publicly available.</p>
<p>The second strategic priority to highlight is&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;better retirement outcomes and member services&rsquo;</strong>. And while this includes our well-publicised work on member services for members of super funds, our work in this area is not limited to super. It also includes a focus on entities and individuals involved in the provision of advice.</p>
<p>An important initiative in this area is our thematic review into self-managed super fund establishment advice, which is focusing on why some clients are advised to set up an SMSF.</p>
<p>As part of this, we&rsquo;re reviewing client advice files, where SMSF establishment advice was provided, to assess compliance with the best interests duty and related obligations. We&rsquo;re also reviewing information from licensees about their oversight and the application of their policies and procedures in the context of SMSF establishment advice. And I expect that we&rsquo;ll release the findings from this work in the second half of this calendar year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, besides our strategic priorities, we also have&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">enforcement priorities</a>, which are announced annually. And these target specific forms of misconduct that are of serious concern to ASIC.</p>
<p>Over the coming year, you can expect, through those priorities, to see a sustained focus on advice-related misconduct.</p>
<p>In light of some of the poor practices we&rsquo;re seeing, which I&rsquo;ve spoken about, the 2025 priorities include&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>And I want to say, our work in this area won&rsquo;t be limited to superannuation trustees or responsible entities of managed investment schemes. It will include the broad range of entities involved in conduct causing harm to consumers and investors &ndash; including advisers and licensees.</p>
<p>And the final thing I want to say is those enforcement priorities are set in a context in which our investment in enforcement and our appetite for taking on significant matters are increasing.</p>
<p>We currently have action underway against NAB, HSBC, the ASX, Harvey Norman, QBE and Rex. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the trial of former directors and officers of the Star Entertainment Group, which is commencing today. The number of investigations that we commenced in the last six months of 2024 was up more than 30%, year-on-year, and some of these will flow through into future litigation and compliance action.</p>
<p>And I really hope that this stronger approach to enforcement is something that&rsquo;s welcomed by people in this room. Because when advice goes terribly wrong, the harm that it causes to consumers can damage confidence in the entire industry.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I wanted to say by way of intro. Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, one of our core functions is to promote the informed participation of consumers and investors in the system.</p>
<p>Your clients trust you to help them make confident and informed decisions &ndash; and, in many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</p>
<p>So, I hope that these comments give you confidence that ASIC is committed to continuing to work with you to help you to comply with the law in ways that produce good outcomes for consumers. Thank you.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge funds gained in January to begin 2025 navigating a volatile month highlighted the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US President, confirmation procedures of key appointed Cabinet positions, and a wide range of executive orders implementing policy changes across a number of areas including immigration, trade/tariffs, energy policy and spending reductions. In addition to this, managers also navigated a volatile month in the technology sector, with earnings, capital expenditures and strategic outlooks impacted by intense competition in the AI space driven by the Chinese startup Deepseek.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite gained +1.4 percent for the month, led by the directional HFRI Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +2.1 percent. The HFR Cryptocurrency Index extended its 2024 surge, adding +0.36 percent in January on the favorable outlook for cryptocurrency by the incoming Trump administration. The recently launched HFRI Multi-Manager/Pod Shop Index advanced +1.9 percent for the month as managers navigated policies from the new administration, as well as Technology volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge fund performance dispersion contracted slightly in January, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.9 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 12.0 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in December 2024 was 13.2 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending January 2025, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +41.4 percent, while the bottom decile declined -9.9 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 51.3 percent. Nearly eighty percent (80%) of hedge funds produced positive performance in January.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">HFR unveiled an expansion of its HFRI, HFRI 500 and HFRI 400 index families, launching new indices delineated by fund liquidity. The new composite and strategy-level indices are split into two liquidity categories: one for funds with monthly (or more frequent) liquidity, the other comprised of funds offering less than monthly liquidity (quarterly, etc.). The purpose of the new indices is to empower investors by offering hedge fund benchmarks that more closely resemble the liquidity characteristics of their underlying hedge fund or other alternative asset portfolios.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge continues to lead main strategy performance</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, extended 2024 leadership with a strong gain to begin 2025 while navigating both new policy and technology sector volatility, with the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index advancing +2.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index, which surged +3.6 percent for the month, the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, which jumped +2.8 percent, and the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which added +1.65 percent in January.</span></p>

Despite the volatility, directional Equity Hedge strategies led broad-based strategy gains for the month, with contributions from Fundamental, Quantitative and Shareholder Activist sub-strategy exposures,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;Many financial market risks have shifted and evolved but not fallen, with geopolitical risk shifting from election outcomes and military conflicts to policy changes and conflict resolution; inflation and interest rate risks remain, while expectations for continued growth in AI-fueled large cap technology are in some cases tempered by high capital expenditures and intense global competition. Managers have been positioning for this dynamic environment for several months, with intensive positioning since the US election in November, and it is likely that managers are positioned for acceleration of these policy changes throughout 1H25. Investors are likely to increase allocations to managers which have effectively demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s specialized ability to navigate these policy changes and rapidly shifting market cycles which create both risk and opportunities.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>SEC: Exemption From Exchange Act Rule 13f-2 And Related Form SHO</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-exemption-from-exchange-act-rule-13f-2-and-related-form-sho-202528/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-exemption-from-exchange-act-rule-13f-2-and-related-form-sho-202528/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided a temporary exemption from compliance with Rule 13f-2 under the Securities Exchange Act and from reporting on Form SHO. As a result of the exemption, filings on initial Form SHO reports from institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds will be due by Feb. 17, 2026, for the January 2026 reporting period. The effective date for Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO was Jan. 2, 2024, and the compliance date for such rule and form was Jan. 2, 2025, with initial Form SHO filings originally due by Feb. 14, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 requires institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds to file Form SHO with the Commission within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month with regard to certain equity securities via the Commission&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR). The Commission will publish, on an aggregated basis, certain information regarding each equity security reported by institutional investment managers on Form SHO and filed with the Commission via EDGAR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. &ldquo;This exemption gives filers more time to implement the technical updates required for compliance according to standards that were released only on Dec. 16, 2024, immediately prior to the holidays. Regardless of this exemption, abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful, and the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exemption will provide industry participants sufficient time to work with Commission staff to address any outstanding operational and compliance questions. This exemption will also provide filers sufficient time to complete implementation of system builds and testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency is essential to well-functioning markets. And the Commission has stated the importance of providing more disclosure about short selling. It is also important to enhance the accuracy of the short sale-related data that would ultimately be provided to investors by giving institutional investment managers additional time.</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO reporting will enhance the transparency of other available short sale-related information. Currently, several self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are providing on their websites daily aggregate short selling volume information for individual equity securities. The SROs are also providing website disclosure on a one-month delayed basis of information regarding individual short sale transactions in all exchange-listed equity securities. Hyperlinks to short sale data&nbsp;provided by specific SROs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/short-sale-volume-and-transaction-data">are available</a>. Further, the SROs are also publishing monthly statistics on short interest in securities that trade on their markets.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/fails-deliver-data">publishes on its website</a>&nbsp;failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the appointment of Rodney E. Hood as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, effective February 10, 2025. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent designated Mr. Hood pursuant to his authority in 12 U.S.C. 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful for the trust of Secretary Bessent and will work diligently to promote a regulatory environment that is effective without being excessive,&rdquo; said Mr. Hood. &ldquo;I remain committed to a balanced framework&mdash;one that fosters innovation, expands financial inclusion, and ensures that all Americans have fair access to the financial services they need to thrive. I look forward to leading the dedicated career staff at the OCC, whose expertise and commitment are essential to maintaining a safe and sound banking system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hood succeeds Acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu, who has served in the role since May 10, 2021.</p>
<p>"I thank Mr. Hsu for his many years of dedicated public service and his commitment to strengthening the resilience of the U.S. banking system," said Mr. Hood.</p>
<p>Mr. Hood was previously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2005 and again in 2019 to serve on the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUA). In 2019, President Donald J.

While at the NCUA, Hood also served as a voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, as the NeighborWorks America Board Chairman, and as Vice Chairman of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.</p>
<p>Before public service, Mr. Hood held senior roles in retail finance, commercial banking, affordable housing, and community development in the private sector.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent today announced his intention to appoint Rodney E. Hood as a Deputy Comptroller and to designate him the First Deputy Comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In this role, Mr. Hood will also serve as Acting Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong leadership and career experience of Rodney Hood will strengthen the OCC&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system while also enhancing economic growth," said Secretary Bessent.</p>

<p>The OCC is a bureau within the Department of the Treasury, and the Comptroller of the Currency is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. By statute (12 U.S.C. &sect; 4), the Treasury Secretary is responsible for appointing up to four Deputy Comptrollers of the Currency and designating one as the First Deputy Comptroller.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is such a pleasure to be back in Miami, a city I have seen grow and become ever more dynamic over the decades, as I have come many times to visit my large extended family here ever since the 1980s.</p>
<p>As I discussed in my final speech of 2024, two positive supply shocks have significantly benefited the U.S. economy over the past two years and have also affected the conduct of monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The first of these has been the surge in population over the past few years that has helped bring labor supply into balance with labor demand and, thus, also helped move inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. The other positive supply shock, which I outlined in my remarks in December, has been a step-up in aggregate productivity growth since 2020, which is an increase in the amount of economic output, across the economy, per hour worked or some other unit of labor. Although productivity growth, measured quarterly, can be quite volatile, over the past five years this acceleration is quite evident. While productivity grew by about 1.5 percent a year from 2005 to 2019, starting in 2020 it has grown about 2 percent a year. This difference may not look dramatic, but because of compounding year-over-year, the consequences of an additional 1/2 percentage point in growth over the past five years are significant for workers and the U.S. economy. When workers are more productive, it effectively means that businesses can produce more without needing to add workers, and that they can pay workers more without needing to raise prices. When they are more productive, it can also serve as an incentive for businesses to expand. Across the economy, higher productivity growth means that real wages and living standards for workers can rise faster without putting upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what has been happening recently, a period when inflation has been falling while the economy is expanding. While fast growth in wages was one of the factors driving inflation in 2021 and 2022, most likely some of that increase was due to productivity growth and, hence, was not inflationary. If productivity continues to grow at an accelerated pace, it would support the FOMC's efforts to keep unemployment low and return inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to spend the balance of my remarks exploring some of the possible reasons why productivity has accelerated, and the prospects that this fortunate development will continue.</p>
<p>Numerous factors affect aggregate productivity, and several may have driven the increase in productivity growth in the U.S. since the pandemic, in contrast to the subdued productivity growth experienced by other advanced economies around the world.</p>
<p>One such factor may have been a result of the enormous movement of workers caused by the pandemic. It began with the dramatic loss of 22 million jobs in the spring of 2020, the reemployment of many of those workers and the continued mobility as people quit jobs, switched occupations and careers, and relocated in response to the enormous changes in work and home life brought about by the pandemic. In finding new jobs, in what became a very tight labor market, workers had the opportunity to find better matches for their skills and, to some extent, work that they were motivated to carry out and which made them more productive. One indication that this was probably a significant factor in the U.S. is that other advanced economies where there was less worker movement have experienced lower rates of productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Economic data and research suggest that periods of strong job re-allocation are accompanied or followed by higher productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>The tightness of the labor market since 2021 has also likely led firms to invest to a greater extent in labor-saving as well as labor-enhancing technologies, which, of course, is traditionally one of the major sources of productivity gains. For example, many retail businesses seemed to have installed more self-checkout machines after the onset of the pandemic, allowing employers to substitute capital for workers when workers could not come to work in person and when there were severe shortages. More generally, digital technology allowed employees to continue working from home during the period of the pandemic and beyond, saving commuting time and making employees potentially more productive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>To the extent that these factors are boosting productivity growth, they are by their nature one-off developments that eventually will fade. A notable exception may turn out to be productivity improvements from investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI investment by businesses has stepped up in the past two years, and it appears to be accelerating.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The advent of the internet and related innovations boosted productivity growth for about 10 years starting in the mid-1990s, and the benefits of AI could potentially be that revolutionary and persistent.</p>
<p>In addition to being temporary, the factors that I have outlined that could be boosting productivity, job re-allocation, and technological investments are themselves hard to measure across the economy. And so are their effects on productivity as well. But there is another important factor that is likely to be driving productivity higher whose effects may well persist, and that is the surge in new business formation experienced since 2019. As I will explain, new businesses are associated with higher rates of overall productivity growth, and that may be particularly true for some of the sectors in which these businesses were created.</p>
<p>Applications for new business tax identification numbers jumped shortly after the pandemic began and have remained elevated since then.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In 2024, the pace of applications that are likely to result in employer business formation was about 30 percent above its 2019 pace. This surge is largely unique to the U.S. In the euro zone, for example, business registrations have been relatively flat. This may help explain why labor productivity growth in Europe has been well below that of the U.S. in recent years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The surge in applications in early 2020 was an early signal of an acceleration in the creation of job-creating new firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The latest data available indicate that new firms created 1.9 million jobs in 2023, 14 percent higher than the total for 2019.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A couple of aspects of this surge in business entry in the U.S. are noteworthy. First, the surge was particularly noticeable in high-tech industries that, historically, are important for overall innovation and productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Second, while the pace of business applications has cooled somewhat over the past year, it still remains elevated and well above pre-pandemic norms. It is, in fact, proving somewhat more persistent than some expected.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the surge in new business formation is highly relevant to our discussion about productivity. There is a large body of research that finds that new firms are key contributors to innovation and growth in aggregate productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a><span>&nbsp;</span>This might seem surprising and counterintuitive, since it is well known that many new firms fail in their first year or two. But in the commotion of competition that these many new businesses face, there are always businesses that persist and keep their lights on, and those often do so because they are innovative and more productive. New businesses are the essence of the competition that drives market-based economies, and it is not surprising that they would be an important source of new products or processes for doing business&mdash;and a source of growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Of course, not every new firm has to innovate and grow to make important economic contributions. Every entrepreneur contributes even if they just create a job for themselves and their family members. But those new firms that do innovate and grow are critical for improvements in overall productivity over time.</p>
<p>As I noted before, since the surge in entrepreneurship after the onset of the pandemic featured an increase in high-tech businesses as well, the productivity implications could be significant. Indeed, the last period of strong productivity growth in the U.S., which ran from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, was preceded by a surge of new business creation in high-tech industries, including those industries that more recently have been associated with AI-related developments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;So this is one source of my optimism about continued robust productivity growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>But it is not only the innovations produced directly by new businesses that are important, since by any measure these new firms are a small share of total businesses. New businesses also help drive innovation by existing firms. As they scramble for funding, customers, and human capital, new businesses will increase competition with existing ones, forcing them to innovate as well so they can succeed. This is surely also driving the recent acceleration in productivity growth.</p>
<p>Many predicted that the surge in new business creation would disappear as effects of the pandemic have faded, but this has not really happened. It is possible that the surge in entry will recede and that its productivity effects will likewise be temporary. On the other hand, the productivity gains from a surge in entry could last for some time, since these highly productive young firms have been found to grow rapidly for several years, contributing to aggregate productivity growth along the way. Time will tell, but for now, it seems likely that this is a factor supporting productivity growth at a higher-than-historical rate.</p>
<p>I will confess to you all that it is not a coincidence that I have come to Miami to highlight the role of entrepreneurship in innovation and productivity growth. Miami and the Miami metropolitan area is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial area, a place with high rates of new business creation, and it is likely an important source of the recent productivity surge.</p>
<p>Out of more than 900 U.S. cities for which we have data, Miami's post-pandemic new firm entry rate ranked 8th in the nation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;And Miami is not alone in Florida; 5 of the top 20 cities for pandemic-era business formation are here in your state.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Miami specifically, and Florida generally, has been a key part of the U.S. entrepreneurship story for some time. During the decade before the pandemic, Miami ranked 5th out of more than 900 U.S. cities for firm entry rates, and Florida featured 8 of the top 20 U.S. cities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Miami is special in this regard. I wonder what is in the water here to produce such a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Perhaps it is the extent of sunshine, which has long been associated with optimism. Perhaps it is the friendly economic climate&mdash;in my own academic research, I have found that policies that facilitate business entry and support worker or job re-allocation are indeed helpful for dynamism and productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;But an interesting question for me as the first Hispanic at the Board of Governors since its creation is whether the large Hispanic population in Florida is also a factor behind the impressive pace of business dynamism that I have just described.</p>
<p>More than 25 percent of Florida's population is Hispanic, compared with around 20 percent for the United States as a whole.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Nationwide, recent data indicate that Latinos account for a dominant&mdash;and rapidly growing&mdash;share of new entrepreneurship in the U.S., with a particular increase since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Of course, many of these Latino entrepreneurs are also immigrants, another group with a well-known proclivity for entrepreneurship.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;There are immigrants in Miami from the Caribbean and all over the world who contribute to the entrepreneurial culture of this city, and it is surely this culture, as much as the efforts of any nationality or group, that is the real engine of the dynamism here. I applaud you all for fostering that culture here in Florida, which is such an important contributor to the economic growth of our nation. More entrepreneurs means more productivity, which is crucial to U.S. prosperity.</p>
<p>Let me conclude with an outline of my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and the FOMC's efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a strong labor market.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy remains on a firm footing.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) continues to grow at a solid pace. The Bureau for Economic Analysis estimates that real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, and private domestic final purchases, which is the best indicator for GDP one quarter ahead, grew a solid 3.2 percent. Therefore, I anticipate solid GDP growth also in the first quarter of this year. In addition, earlier today the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers created 143,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged down to 4 percent, consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.</p>
<p>Inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, and in September the FOMC judged that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels intended to strongly restrict aggregate demand and put downward pressure on inflation. We reduced our policy rate 100 basis points through December, but the recent progress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated. There is also considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of proposals of new policies. Going forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
