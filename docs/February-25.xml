<p dir="ltr"><span>JP Jenkins (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.jpjenkins.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.jpjenkins.com</a>), the UK&rsquo;s largest private marketplace for unlisted securities, has today announced its first deployment of AI technology. The solution, from data science specialists Insig AI, provides access to the company&rsquo;s Transparency and Disclosure Index (TDI) reports.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Veronika Oswald, Commercial Director at JP Jenkins commented:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of hype surrounding AI but we have absolutely recognised the benefits that solutions like Insig AI&rsquo;s TDI can deliver in scrutinising corporate behaviour. With a significant volume of data to work through, AI can help form a consensus opinion with just a fraction of the resource it would take a traditional analyst team to achieve the same outcome.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Insight AI provides a ready-made toolkit that allows users to quantify and explore datasets. By searching, filtering, analysing and benchmarking company disclosures, peer group comparisons can be generated in an instant, traceable and economical manner, with the Transparency and Disclosure Index driving ESG insights.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Richard Bernstein of Insig AI added:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>The team at JP Jenkins presented us with a classic use case for AI technology. It needed the ability to rank and review the clarity and relevance of a company&rsquo;s sustainable reporting in relation to its peers. This technology allows it to identify sectoral trends and match these with data visualisations, delivering comprehensive reports quickly and efficiently. We are delighted to be partnering with JP Jenkins&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As a technology-centric company, JP Jenkins expects to make further considered AI deployments as part of its growth plans, where the business case clearly justifies such innovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has released its Regulatory Sandbox Guidelines, detailing the eligibility criteria and requirements for participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By empowering industry players to experiment with innovative ideas, the sandbox embodies our vision of building a dynamic, inclusive, and future-ready capital market. It also fosters collaboration across the ecosystem, ensuring progress aligns with investor protection,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On the sidelines of the inaugural annual global AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies in Al Ula, Saudi Arabia (February 16-17), Saudi Arabia's Finance Ministry and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) co-hosted a high-level roundtable on "Working Together to Support Recovery in the Middle East's Conflict-Affected Economies", with a focus on Syria,&nbsp; bringing together finance ministers of countries in the region, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, the Managing Director of Operations at the World Bank Group and heads of other International Financial Institutions and the Arab Coordination Group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the IMF, and Mohammed Aljadaan, Finance Minister of Saudi Arabia, made the following statement:</p>
<p>"This important meeting brought together representatives from the Middle East and key economic and development partners to discuss how we can work together to support recovery in the Middle East's conflict-affected economies, with a focus on Syria.</p>
<p>"We thank all participants for realizing the urgency and importance of this task, as well as for their commitment to pool knowledge and work together to ensure that the conflict-affected countries can start addressing their humanitarian needs and begin a rebuilding era for their economies in an efficient, swift, and durable way for the benefit of their people.</p>
<p>"Participants welcomed the meeting as an opportunity to discuss recent developments and build a common understanding of the challenges facing conflict-affected countries. They emphasized the importance of strengthening coordination to support the recovery of these countries as the negative spillovers would impact all. Particular attention was paid to the situation in Syria.</p>
<p>Participants agreed on the following priorities to support conflict-affected countries:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>A Continuous Diagnostic&nbsp;</b>of the challenges and [economic and social] context facing each conflict-affected country, including an assessment of humanitarian and reconstruction needs. Such a diagnostic should identify institution-building priorities, gaps in policies, and financing needs.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Capacity Development (CD)</b>&nbsp;aimed at rapidly scaling up IMF and World Bank CD initiatives to help strengthen and, as needed, build new institutions. Support would need to be tailored to strengthen essential functions of fiscal, monetary and banking institutions.</li>
<li><b>Mobilization of financial assistance from the international community</b>. Financial support&mdash;coordinated with international and regional development partners&mdash;will be needed to fund comprehensive reform programs, including reconstruction and humanitarian aid.</li>
</ul>
<p>"The IMF, World Bank, the Arab Coordination Group, and countries of the region underscored their readiness to work together and complement each other's efforts while focusing on their institutional mandates. They will continue to work closely and with other partners to further support the international response to the recovery of conflict-affected economies in the Middle East region.</p>
<p>They agreed to establish an informal coordination group to support those efforts,&nbsp; they agreed that discussions on those efforts will be continued at the upcoming&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLiiLkoSBc7ZAKaAcNgFbENJ-2B5TAloRQHVKCC36cH95RG4xLkR_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJMbsX7hEYbsKAMsOmJy-2B5u8m4TS469zFm1YJmEWiAfXI-2BS6QQa9FgJYwCQk-2Bq-2FzK5wK7xDdppmkHxKYrftBRi9p3F4z-2FfPitzLTJmx-2BFN-2BQxbTJhIn4MYlnZ0qymgqHL5KEDiHLRcPAeyGnnHYIboyuc6EhFSKasxDhEdU6hCrKjDFsbH4hfL-2BVEdgmoJOBNkUR-2FU8jwbj87Ab5gRCcxcEDKoVVf2xto0pDpmurA0MW7DXc6H724Be5Ga7CTLYmrwpK9BEpEmBXYd-2BX2xw-2FZO1OsopyYc5Fdd2Q27qMvv2rg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings on&nbsp;</a>April 25-27 in Washington, D.C."</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Individual Ordered To Pay Compensation And Pecuniary Penalty For Making False Or Misleading Representations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-individual-ordered-to-pay-compensation-2025216/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-individual-ordered-to-pay-compensation-2025216/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rangi Wyatt Stephen Savage Senior has been ordered to pay compensation of $126,214 to investors and a pecuniary penalty of $142,500 for breaching the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (the FMCA). The High Court judgment follows civil proceedings brought by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proceedings were based on a regulated public offer for the sale of shares in The Powder Shed Tokoroa Limited (Powder Shed). Mr Savage was the sole director of Powder Shed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The High Court found Mr Savage breached the FMCA by:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Making false or misleading representations &nbsp;</li>
<li>Making a regulated offer without a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Accepting an application for a transfer of financial products without a PDS.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, said: &ldquo;The FMA brought this proceeding because Mr Savage seriously undermined the main purposes of financial markets legislation. In the FMA&rsquo;s view, Mr Savage&rsquo;s conduct was deliberately misleading. Many of his investors were first time investors with little experience in financial markets and the total harm caused was significant. Bank records show Mr Savage transferred the investors&rsquo; money to his own personal bank account, and to pay debts and expenses of another company that he had incorporated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To date, Mr Savage has made no attempt to repay his investors despite claiming he would do so. The Court has ordered him to pay back investors via the FMA to ensure the investors receive their compensation. The FMA encourages New Zealanders to treat any offer of a financial product through social media with caution and to speak to a licensed financial adviser.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>The High Court found that Mr Savage made false or misleading statements from April to July 2020 in online presentations and social media videos when promoting the sale of shares in Powder Shed to potential investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the claims were that he had a suitable site, had secured a major contract, and had financial backing for the business. He also claimed a substantial dividend would be paid out in the first 12 months. None of these claims could be substantiated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At no point during the time the offers were made was a product disclosure statement lodged or provided to investors.&nbsp; The High Court found that Mr Savage&rsquo;s failure to provide a product disclosure statement meant that investors did not have the information that would have assisted them in making a decision to invest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 160 individual investors applied to purchase shares in Powder Shed. Approximately 65,000 shares were sold and issued to investors at USD$1.20 per share. Investors paid in USD or in cryptocurrency. The total amount obtained equates to approximately NZD$126,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Savage did not engage in the proceedings and a formal proof hearing was held at the High Court in Auckland on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Downs delivered judgment immediately after the hearing, declaring that Mr Savage contravened the FMCA and ordering him to pay compensation to the investors and a pecuniary penalty to the Crown. Mr Savage is required to pay the compensation to the FMA and, in turn, by the FMA to investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justice Downs also imposed a banning order for six years. It prohibits Mr Savage from:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Being a director or promotor of an entity in NZ.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Being in any way concerned in the management of an entity in NZ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Taking part in the management of an entity in NZ.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sections of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2013/0069/latest/whole.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link to legislation.govt.nz page.">FMCA</a>&nbsp;alleged to have been breached:  &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 22 </li>
<li>Section 48(1) </li>
<li>Section 50 &nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom has appointed Michael Detoy as the local government elected official on the CalPERS Board of Administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detoy hails from Southern California where he has served as a councilmember and mayor of the City of Hermosa Beach since 2019. In addition, he is a fire captain with the City of Riverside where he has served since 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We congratulate Michael on his appointment, and we welcome the perspective he brings on behalf of our local government partners,&rdquo; said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. &ldquo;His dedication to public service, both as a city leader in Hermosa Beach and as a firefighter, will serve him well in our vital mission to provide retirement security and quality health care to CalPERS members and their families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detoy, whose tenure on the board begins immediately, earned a Bachelor of Science in Finance from Santa Clara University and a Master of Public Administration from California Baptist University. He has also served as a trustee on the California Firefighters Benefits Trust and is a fiduciary trustee of the International Association of Fire Fighters Retiree Medical Trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life has been devoted to public service and I am honored for this opportunity,&rdquo; Detoy said. &ldquo;I see public service as a basic responsibility, a way of giving back to society, and I look forward to making a difference in the lives of more than 2.2 million CalPERS members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detoy will replace Lisa Middleton, a former member of the Palm Springs City Council, who was appointed to the board in May of 2019.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Lisa Middleton for her service to CalPERS, our members, employers and board,&rdquo; Frost added. &ldquo;Lisa has been part of the CalPERS family for almost six years, working tirelessly to ensure our employer partners are well-represented in every decision CalPERS makes. As the first transgender person elected to a non-judicial office in California, Lisa represents the very best of CalPERS and has been a trusted partner to her fellow board members and the executive team. We wish her the very best in the next chapter of her life and career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 13-member CalPERS Board of Administration sets policy and oversees the administration of retirement and health benefits on behalf of California public employers, and their active and retired employees. The board also oversees administration of the pension fund&rsquo;s investments. Under the California Constitution, the CalPERS Board has exclusive authority to administer the CalPERS pension fund.</p>
<p>The next board meeting will take place on Feb. 18-19.</p>

<title>SEC Charges One Oak Capital Management And Michael DeRosa With Breaching Fiduciary Duties To Clients</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against New York-based registered investment adviser One Oak Capital Management LLC, and former One Oak investment adviser representative, Michael DeRosa, for misconduct related to advisory services provided to their retail clients.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from approximately June 2020 through October 2023, One Oak and DeRosa recommended that DeRosa&rsquo;s customers at an unaffiliated broker-dealer, at which he was simultaneously employed, convert more than 180 brokerage accounts to advisory accounts at One Oak. Most of these customers were elderly and had been long-time customers of DeRosa&rsquo;s at the broker-dealer, which charged the customers on a commission basis. According to the order, One Oak and DeRosa ignored their fiduciary duty and failed to adequately disclose that the conversions from brokerage accounts to advisory accounts would result in significantly higher fees for the clients and increased compensation for DeRosa; nor did they disclose the resulting conflict of interest. The order finds that the change in fee structure resulted in significantly increased costs, but the clients generally received no additional services or benefits. The order further finds that One Oak and DeRosa failed to adequately consider whether it was in their clients&rsquo; best interests to convert their brokerage accounts to advisory accounts, and in fact, many of the accounts were not suitable to be advisory accounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remain committed to holding accountable investment advisers who breach their fiduciary duties at the expense of retail clients,&rdquo; said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Regional Director in the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;One Oak and DeRosa converted brokerage accounts to advisory accounts when it benefitted them through higher fees, but that conversion was not in their clients&rsquo; best interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that One Oak and DeRosa willfully violated the antifraud provisions of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that One Oak also violated the compliance rule provisions of the Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, One Oak consented to an order requiring it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and to retain an independent compliance consultant to review certain of its policies and procedures related to its retail business. Without admitting or denying the findings in the order, DeRosa agreed to a civil penalty of $75,000 and to a nine-month industry suspension.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alexander M. Levine, Hermann A. Vargas, and Liora Sukhatme under the supervision of Ms. Shah, all of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of Thomas Strafaci, Stephanie A. Morena, David Jaffe, and Jennifer A. Grumbrecht of the Division of Examinations in the New York Regional Office.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s securities and markets regulator launches today a Common Supervisory Action (CSA) with National Competent Authorities (NCAs) on compliance and internal audit functions of UCITS management companies and Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMs) across the EU.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The CSA will be conducted throughout 2025 and aims to assess to what extent UCITS management companies and AIFMs have established effective compliance and internal audit functions with the adequate staffing, authority, knowledge, and expertise to perform their duties under the AIFM and UCITS Directives.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Compliance and internal audit functions are designed to ensure that the internal control mechanisms to monitor, identify, measure, and mitigate any possible risks of non-compliance with the applicable rules are in place. Therefore, ensuring that the entities have robust internal controls is crucial to avoid investor detriment and preserve financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The work will be done using a common assessment framework developed by ESMA, which sets out the scope, methodology, supervisory expectations, and timeline on how to carry out a comprehensive supervisory action in a convergent manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">During the year, NCAs will share knowledge and experiences through ESMA to foster convergence in how they supervise the compliance of UCITS management companies and AIFMs with the relevant rules in the area.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will publish a final report with the results of the exercise in 2026.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acting-cftc-chairman-pham-announces-brian-young-as-director-of-enforcement-2025214/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today announced Brian Young will serve as the agency&rsquo;s Director of Enforcement. Young has been serving in an acting capacity since January 22, and previously was the Director of the Whistleblower Office. He is a distinguished federal prosecutor with nearly 20 years of service at the Department of Justice, including Acting Director of Litigation for the Antitrust Division and Chief of the Litigation Unit for the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division, and has successfully tried some of the most high-profile criminal fraud and manipulation cases in the CFTC&rsquo;s markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian exemplifies the best of what we stand for at the CFTC,&rdquo; said Acting Chairman Pham. &ldquo;He is a fearless leader that will build an even more impressive enforcement program that will stay true to the CFTC&rsquo;s mission to protect the American public from fraudsters and scammers. I am confident that under Brian&rsquo;s leadership, the CFTC will expand and scale our resources to help more victims than ever before and ensure the integrity of our markets in the name of justice. Brian has hit the ground running and I look forward to seeing his continued impact to strengthen the Division of Enforcement and deliver results.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Acting Chairman Pham for her confidence in me and for her commitment to continuing the CFTC&rsquo;s aggressive efforts to protect our global commodity markets from fraud, manipulation, and other abusive practices,&rdquo; said Young. &ldquo;As former Director of the Whistleblower Officer, I worked closely with the talented and dedicated staff of the Division of Enforcement, and I look forward to working with this highly motivated group to help bring justice for victims, protect those who cannot protect themselves, and root out misconduct and wrongdoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Brian Young, Director of Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>Young joined the CFTC in 2024 as the Director of the Whistleblower Office following nearly 20 years at the Department of Justice. During his first year as the Director of the Whistleblower Office, Young oversaw a team that achieved a record high number of annual dispositions of whistleblower award applications. His most recent role at DOJ was as the Acting Director of Litigation for the Antitrust Division, where he served as the highest-ranking career official in the Antitrust Division&rsquo;s litigation program. There, he oversaw criminal prosecutions brought under the Sherman Act as well as civil merger and antitrust conduct litigation.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Before his time at the Antitrust Division, Young served in various roles in the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division, culminating in his appointment as Chief of the Fraud Section&rsquo;s Litigation Unit.<span>&nbsp;</span>While at the Fraud Section, Young tried several of the most significant white collar crime matters in the past decade, including prosecutions of the first individuals tried in the United States on charges of manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR); the former head of HSBC Bank&rsquo;s Foreign Exchange (FX) desk in connection with a scheme to &ldquo;frontrun&rdquo; a client on a $3.5 billion FX trade; and two former London and Singapore-based Deutsche Bank precious metals traders arising from a scheme to &ldquo;spoof&rdquo; the futures markets by placing over $1 billion in non-bona fide orders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Young joined the DOJ through the Attorney General&rsquo;s Honors Program and began his career as a law clerk for the Honorable Alice M. Batchelder of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. During his time at DOJ, Young received the Attorney General&rsquo;s Award for Distinguished Service, three Assistant Attorney General&rsquo;s Awards for Exceptional Service, and an Outstanding Service Award from the Washington Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&nbsp;</p>

According to the Disciplinary Committee, there were no grounds for delaying the disclosure under Article 17.4 (b) of MAR.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CloudMargin, a leading global collateral management technology company, last night won the FOW International Award for Collateral Management Solution of the Year. The honour, presented in London at a ceremony following the FOW Trading London 2025 conference, marked the fifth win in the collateral management category for the company, which celebrated its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2024.</p>
<p>The FOW International Awards recognise the &ldquo;best and brightest innovations in the derivatives industry.&rdquo; A panel of independent, expert judges with experience across the derivatives markets select the winners. Among their comments were that CloudMargin is a &ldquo;very strong provider&rdquo; with an &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; client testimonial that accompanied the nomination. Another said: &ldquo;Source agnostic / centralisation of cross-asset data to manage workflows enterprise-wide on a single platform and optimisation of inventory usage&rdquo; is &ldquo;very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CloudMargin CEO Stuart Connolly said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re incredibly honoured to accept this award from FOW following a monumental year for our company. We reached landmark agreements with some of the world&rsquo;s leading banks and asset servicing firms. We took on a host of new clients on our continuously updated cloud platform, to help them solve significant collateral and margin challenges in the face of market forces and pressure to control costs. And we continue to see the strongest pipeline in our history, as we help firms onboard quickly so they can benefit from automated end-to-end collateral management and access managed connectivity to the broader industry ecosystem. None of this could be achieved without the CloudMargin team&rsquo;s tremendous dedication, ability to meet challenges and solve problems, and continual focus on our clients that enables us to keep improving and growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CloudMargin platform was accessed throughout the year in 52 countries, processing nearly 1 million margin calls. On its busiest day in 2024, CloudMargin facilitated the exchange of more than $20 billion in collateral by its clients.</p>
<p>Clients of the firm include asset managers, pension funds, banks, brokerages, insurance firms, fund administrators, outsourcers and major industry service providers using the CloudMargin platform to manage collateral for cleared and uncleared over-the-counter (OTC) products, exchange-traded derivatives, repo forward securities and securities lending products.</p>
<p>Supporting the firm&rsquo;s continued trajectory of growth, innovation and market leadership, CloudMargin recently launched a new version of its corporate website, <a href="https://www.cloudmargin.com/">cloudmargin.com</a>.</p>

<p>MyCIF is Malaysia's first public-private co-investment model, leveraging equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to peer (P2P) financing platforms to support MSMEs. It was established under Federal Budget 2019 by the Ministry of Finance and administered by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC).</p>
<p>MyCIF implements a 1:4 co-investment ratio for the General Scheme and a 1:2 coinvestment ratio for the Food Security Scheme and Environmental and Social Impact Scheme.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised by the SC in partnership with the Northern Corridor Implementation Authority (NCIA), the one-day MyCIF roadshow will also feature an overview of equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to-peer (P2P) financing as alternative financing avenues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, this collaboration leverages NCIA&rsquo;s extensive experience in empowering business communities within the Northern Corridor Economic Region (NCER), which encompasses Penang, Perak, Kedah, and Perlis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This roadshow aims to enhance access to financing for businesses in the Northern region while raising awareness of MyCIF, ECF and P2P in supporting MSMEs. Currently, there are over 220,000 MSMEs in the Northern region playing a crucial role in contributing to the northern economy.</p>

<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to network with SC-registered ECF and P2P platform operators as well as government agencies expected to attend. In addition, there will be a series of breakout sessions and exhibitors dedicated to addressing the fundraising needs of businesses, providing valuable insights into alternative financing options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entering its sixth year, MyCIF has played a pivotal role in improving access to the alternative financing sector while fostering the growth of MSMEs in the local start-up ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its inception, with a seed funding of RM260 million, MyCIF has co-invested over RM1 billion in over 9,000 MSMEs, according to latest figures. This has helped businesses access funding through ECF and P2P financing platforms, reflecting the steady investor and business interest in alternative financing options.</p>

<title>US Department Of Justice: Two Estonian Nationals Plead Guilty In $577M Cryptocurrency Fraud Scheme - Scheme Victimized Hundreds Of Thousands Of People In United States And Abroad</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two Estonian nationals pleaded guilty yesterday for their operation of a massive, multi-faceted cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme that victimized hundreds of thousands of people from across the world, including in the United States.&nbsp;As part of the defendants&rsquo; guilty pleas, they agreed to forfeit assets valued over $400 million obtained during the conspiracy.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Tur&otilde;gin, both 40,&nbsp;sold contracts to customers entitling them to a share of cryptocurrency mined by the defendants&rsquo; purported cryptocurrency mining service, HashFlare. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of using computers to generate cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, for profit.</p>
<p>Between 2015 and 2019, Hashflare&rsquo;s sales totaled more than $577 million, but HashFlare did not possess the requisite computing capacity to perform the vast majority of the mining the defendants told HashFlare customers it performed. HashFlare&rsquo;s web-based dashboard, which purported to show customers their mining profits, instead reflected falsified data. Potapenko and Tur&otilde;gin used the proceeds of the fraud conspiracy to purchase real estate and luxury vehicles and maintained investment and cryptocurrency accounts. Potapenko and Tur&otilde;gin have agreed to forfeit assets worth, as of the date of the plea, more than $400 million. The forfeited assets will be available for a remission process to compensate victims of the crime. Details about the remission process will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Potapenko and Tur&otilde;gin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. They are scheduled to be sentenced on May 8 and each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>The Justice Department thanks the Cybercrime Bureau of the Estonian Police and Border Guard for its support with this investigation. The Estonian Prosecutor General and Ministry of Justice and Digital Affairs provided substantial assistance with the extradition. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs provided extensive assistance to the investigation and the extradition of the defendants.</p>
<p>Supervisory Official Antoinette T. Bacon of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller for the Western District of Washington, Assistant Director Chad Yarbrough of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division, and Special Agent in Charge W. Mike Herrington of the FBI Seattle Field Office made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI Seattle Field Office investigated the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorneys Adrienne E. Rosen and David Ginensky of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Andrew Friedman and Sok Jiang for the Western District of Washington are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jehiel Baer for the Western District of Washington is handling asset forfeiture aspects of the case.</p>

<title>Europe’s First CLO ETF Now Listed On LuxSE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Luxembourg Stock Exchange is pleased to confirm the listing of Fair Oaks Capital&rsquo;s trailblazing CLO ETF on the regulated Bourse de Luxembourg market on 6 February. The new GBP-hedged share class has been created under the Fair Oaks AAA CLO sub-fund on the Alpha UCITS SICAV fund platform.</p>
<p>The Fair Oaks AAA CLO fund invests long-only and exclusively in AAA-rated collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), based on Fair Oaks' established investment processes. The CLO-focused fund furthermore complies with ESG investment restrictions and is classified as Article 8 under the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The addition of the industry&rsquo;s first GBP hedged option to access AAA-rated CLOs will enable additional investors to consider the asset class as an alternative for fixed-rate products such as investment grade corporate bonds&rdquo;, Miguel Ramos Fuentenebro, Partner at Fair Oaks Capital, commented, &ldquo;all while benefiting from a track record of considerably lower volatility over the last 5 years, on account of their minimal interest rate risk. AAA-rated CLOs have a history of zero defaults and offer attractive yields, with a considerably higher spread than investment-grade corporates.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Europe&rsquo;s leading fund centre</b></p>
<p>As the second largest fund centre in the world after the United States, Luxembourg has a fund industry that currently holds more than EUR 5.8 trillion in assets under management according to figures from the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (ALFI). The financial centre has put in place a number of initiatives and is becoming an increasingly attractive domicile for active ETFs. As a leading listing venue for a wide array of investment funds, including UCITS, AIFs and ETFs, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange has built up a unique experience in fund listings and is now increasing its focus on actively managed exchange traded funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to welcome this pioneering fund from Fair Oaks Capital to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This is a testament to our unique expertise in the listing of investment funds and the fast time-to-market we provide to Luxembourg-domiciled regulated funds. A listing at LuxSE furthermore serves to boost the fund&rsquo;s liquidity on secondary markets,&rdquo; commented Arnaud Delestienne, Director of International Capital Markets and Member of the Executive Committee at LuxSE.</p>
<p>A LuxSE Partner, Luxembourg-based law firm Elvinger Hoss Prussen advised Fair Oaks Capital in connection with the listing of this fund at LuxSE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luxembourg has recently taken measures to enhance the framework for actively managed ETFs, such as the relaxation of portfolio transparency rules and the abolition of the subscription tax. The listing process of the Fair Oaks AAA CLO ETF on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange was smooth and timely, accelerating the admission on other venues and facilitating the development of a secondary market liquidity in Europe,&rdquo; added Yves Elvinger, Partner at Elvinger Hoss Prussen.</p>
<p><b>Pioneering the European CLO ETF market</b></p>
<p>Fair Oaks Capital established the FAAA CLO ETF in Luxembourg in September 2024, becoming the first investment manager to launch a European-domiciled CLO ETF. This specific type of investment fund offers investors across Europe access to a diversified portfolio of CLOs in an actively managed exchange traded fund, bringing diversification to traditional, fixed-income portfolios. The ETF format allows for efficient and flexible trading while offering investors a higher level of transparency.</p>
<p>Established in 2013 and operating from London&nbsp;and&nbsp;New York, Fair Oaks Capital specialises in CLOs and secured loans, currently managing USD 3 billion&nbsp;in assets for a global client base.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) released economic and financial market scenarios for use in the upcoming stress tests for covered institutions.</p>
<p>The supervisory scenarios include baseline and severely adverse scenarios. Covered institutions are required to use the scenarios to conduct stress tests. The results of the company-run stress tests provide the OCC with forward-looking information used in bank supervision and assist the agency in assessing a covered institution&rsquo;s risk profile and capital adequacy.</p>
<p>Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, requires certain financial companies, including certain national banks and federal savings associations, to conduct periodic stress tests.</p>
<p>The 2025 scenario and background information can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/forms/dodd-frank-act-stress-test/index-dodd-frank-act-stress-test.html" title="Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run)">OCC&rsquo;s Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run) page</a>. The final policy statement on the development and distribution of the scenarios was issued on October 28, 2013, in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext, the&nbsp;leading European capital market infrastructure, today publishes its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Full year 2024 revenue and income was up +10.3% at &euro;1,626.9 million:</span></li>
<li>Non-volume related revenue and income represented 58% of total revenueand income (compared to 60% in 2023) and covered 153% of underlying operating expenses, excluding D&amp;A0F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;(vs. 145% in 2023):</li>
<li>Custody and Settlement revenue grew to &euro;270.5 million (+8.7%), driven by higher assets under custody, dynamic settlement activity and strong growth of value-added services;</li>
<li>Advanced Data Services revenue grew to &euro;241.7 million (+7.5%), driven by continued demand for fixed income trading data, power trading data and dynamic retail usage. Revenue was supported by the acquisition of GRSS, a leading provider of services to benchmark administrators;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Listing revenue grew to &euro;231.9 million (+5.1%), despite headwinds from the NOK1F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;depreciation. This reflects the continued strong performance of corporate solutions and resilient listing revenue. With 53 new equity listings and over 14,700 new bond listings in 2024, Euronext confirms its leading European position in equity listing and its worldwide leadership in debt listing;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Technology Solutions reported &euro;106.2 million of revenue (-3.4%), reflecting<a class="ck-anchor" id="_Hlk179554977">&nbsp;the termination of Borsa Italiana legacy services in March 2024 following the migration to Optiq</a>&reg;.</li>
<li>Trading revenue grew to &euro;559.4 million (+14.2%), driven by record results in fixed income, FX and power trading and solid growth in cash trading revenue;</li>
<li>Clearing revenue grew to &euro;144.3 million (+19.0%), powered by the European expansion of Euronext Clearing, dynamic fixed income activity and the strong performance of commodities clearing. Net&nbsp;treasury income was at &euro;56.8 million (+21.8%).</li>
<li><span>Underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A<span>1</span>&nbsp;were in line with the revised guidance of &euro;620 million, at &euro;620.5 million (+1.7% compared to 2023)</span>. Cost discipline, synergies, and positive one-off items partly offset growth investments and acquisition impacts.</li>
<li><span>Adjusted EBITDA<span>1</span>&nbsp;was &euro;1,006.4 million (+16.4%) and adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.9% (+3.3pts).</span></li>
<li><span>Adjusted net income<span>1</span>&nbsp;was &euro;682.5 million (+16.7%) and adjusted EPS was &euro;6.59 (+19.6%).&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Reported net income was &euro;585.6 million (+14.0%),&nbsp;</span>despite the negative comparison base related to the &euro;41.6 million capital gain received in 2023 for the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s 11.1% stake in LCH SA.</li>
<li><span>Net debt to EBITDA</span>2F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn3"><span>[3]</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>was at 1.4x at the end of December 2024, within Euronext&rsquo;s target range.&nbsp;</span>Euronext&rsquo;s S&amp;P rating was upgraded to &lsquo;A-, Stable Outlook&rsquo; in February&nbsp;2025.</li>
<li><span>Achievement of 2024 financial targets is confirmed.&nbsp;</span>Euronext revenue reached +4.7% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024</span>, above the +3% to +4% targeted. Euronext attained an adjusted EBITDA growth of +6.4% CAGR<span>2020PF-2024</span>, above the +5% to +6% targeted.</li>

<li><span>Dividend proposal to the 2025 Annual General Meeting</span></li>
</ul>
<p>A dividend of &euro;292.8 million will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2025. This represents 50% of 2024 reported net income, in line with Euronext&rsquo;s dividend policy. This dividend represents an increase of +14.0% compared to 20235F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn6">[6]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext continues its cost discipline and invests in strategic growth&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, Euronext reported underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) in line with the revised guidance of &euro;620 million. This compares to an initial guidance of &euro;625 million, which did not take into account the impact of any acquisitions executed over the course of 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2024 normalised underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) were at approximately &euro;640 million, taking into account approximately &euro;8 million of positive one-off items and the full-year impact of bolt-on acquisitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euronext expects its total underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) for 2025 to be around &euro;670 million. Euronext&nbsp;expects its 2025 underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) to be stable at around &euro;640 million compared to 2024 normalised underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A), as savings and synergies are expected to entirely offset inflationary impacts. In addition, Euronext plans to invest around 5% of its normalised underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) to deliver strategic growth projects, as highlighted during the Investor Day on 8 November 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Progress with the delivery of &ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo;</span></li>
<li>Euronext will accelerate the delivery of its power futures ambition with the contemplated acquisition of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business, announced on 28 January 2025.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Euronext continues to leverage its clearing house to launch innovative derivatives products. Euronext will launch fixed income derivatives on major European government bonds, including the first-ever cash-settled mini futures in September 2025, delivering unparalleled accessibility and flexibility to investors.</li>
<li>Euronext announced a strategic collaboration with Euroclear to enhance Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management offering. This collaboration is a major enabler of Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to expand its leading Italian repo clearing franchise&nbsp;to a large range of European government bonds.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span></li>
</ol>
<p><em>"In 2024, we delivered double-digit topline growth thanks to the solid performance of non-volume related activities, excellent performance of FICC trading, and the successful clearing expansion in Europe. For the first time, Euronext reached the significant threshold of over &euro;1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, an increase of +16.4% compared to last year. Our notable adjusted net income growth of +16.7% compared to last year, to &euro;682.5 million underscores our profitability and our robust financial health. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +19.6% in 2024, at &euro;6.59 per share, compared to &euro;5.51 per share in 2023. This increase reflects Euronext&rsquo;s strong performance and a lower number of outstanding shares over 2024 due to Euronext&rsquo;s share repurchase programme.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2024, Euronext achieved several key milestones that allowed us to expand our presence across the entire capital markets value chain, as we have finalised the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group. We have exceeded our 2024 financial targets for revenue and EBITDA growth. We have also strengthened our non-volume business with strategic acquisitions such as GRSS, Substantive Research, and Acupay.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;In 2025, we are building the foundations to achieve our 2027 growth targets and we are investing to innovate for growth. We have already begun with the announced acquisition of Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business</em>6F<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-publishes-q4-and-full-year-2024-results#_ftn7"><em><span>[7]</span></em></a><em>. This addition will significantly contribute to the growth of our FICC trading and clearing business. We are pleased to announce the most significant innovation in financial derivatives in recent years, the launch of cash-settled mini futures on European government bonds. Finally, we have made a first major step in the expansion of our Repo clearing franchise through a strategic collaboration with Euroclear to enhance Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management offering. Euronext has promising growth opportunities ahead, which will further reinforce our position as the leading capital market infrastructure in Europe."</em></p>

<ul>
<li><span>2024 revenue and income</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s revenue and income was &euro;1,626.9 million, up +10.3% compared to 2023. This resulted from solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses, a dynamic trading environment across asset classes, and the positive contribution of the Euronext Clearing European expansion.</li>
<li>On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +10.0% in 2024, at &euro;1,618.2 million, compared to 2023.</li>
<li>Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in 2024, compared to 60% in 2023. This reflects the strong growth in trading and post-trade revenue, and solid performance of non-volume-related revenue. Non-volume-related revenue covered 153% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A, compared to 145% in 2023.</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
<li><span>2024 adjusted EBITDA</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased slightly to &euro;620.5million, up +1.7%, in line with the revised guidance of &euro;620 million, and lower than the initial guidance of &euro;625 million. Cost discipline, FX impacts and positive one-offs (around &euro;8.3 million) partly offset growth investments and acquisitions impacts.</p>
<p>On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +1.0% compared to 2023, which highlights the impact of acquisitions on a reported basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the year totalled &euro;1,006.4 million, up +16.4% compared to 2023. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 61.9%, up +3.3 points compared to 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for 2024 was up +16.3%, to &euro;1,003.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 62.0%, up +3.4 points compared to 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>2024 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;188.7 million in 2024, up +10.9%, resulting from migration projects and acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;81.2 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</p>
<p>2024 adjusted operating profit was &euro;922.9 million, up +16.8% compared to 2023 adjusted operating profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&euro;136.1 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in 2024, related to the implementation of the &lsquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Net financing income for 2024 was &euro;17.5 million, compared to a net financing expense of &euro;0.2<span>&nbsp;</span>million in 2023. This increase resulted from higher interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash generation, offsetting the cost of debt in 2024.</p>
<p>Results from equity investments amounted to &euro;34.7 million in 2024, including &euro;23.4 million of dividend received from Euroclear and the &euro;10.1 million of dividend earned from Sicovam. In 2023, Euronext reported &euro;83.1 million of results from equity investments. This was a result of the capital gain on the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s stake in LCH SA and the disposal of Euronext&rsquo;s investment in Tokeny, as well as the dividend received from Euroclear and Sicovam.</p>
<p>Income tax for 2024 was &euro;218.4 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.0% for 2024. In 2023, the income tax rate was 23.3%, positively impacted by non-taxable income. Income tax amounted to &euro;162.7 million.</p>
<p>Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;35.1 million in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, increased by +14.0% for 2024 compared to 2023, to &euro;585.6 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;5.65 basic and &euro;5.63 diluted in 2024, compared to &euro;4.84 basic and &euro;4.83 diluted in 2023. This increase reflects the strong results and a lower number of shares over 2024 compared to 2023.</p>
<p>Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +16.7% to &euro;682.5 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +19.6% in 2024, at &euro;6.59 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;5.51 per share in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weighted number of shares used over 2024 was 103,578,980 for the basic calculation and 103,983,870 for the diluted calculation, compared to&nbsp;106,051,799 and 106,376,338 respectively over 2023.</p>
<p>In 2024, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;708.6 million, compared to &euro;826.1 million in 2023. The difference results from higher profit before tax, higher income tax, lower results from equity investments and negative changes in working capital. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 72.3% of EBITDA in 2024.</p>

<li><span>Q4 2024 revenue and income</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In Q4 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s revenue and income amounted to &euro;415.8 million, up +11.1% compared to Q4 2023, driven by record performance in fixed income trading, robust results in non-volume related businesses and the positive contribution of the Euronext Clearing European expansion at the end of November 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext revenue and income were up +9.9% in Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023, to &euro;411.1 million.</p>
<p>Non-volume related revenue accounted for 59% of Group revenue in Q4 2024, compared to 60% in Q4 2023, reflecting continued strong performance of trading and post-trade in Q4 2024. The&nbsp;underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 151% in Q4 2024, compared to 141% in Q4 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q4 2024 adjusted EBITDA</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +3.4% to &euro;163.2 million, reflecting investments in growth and the impact of acquisitions. On a like-for-like basis, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +1.1% compared to Q4 2023, reflecting mainly the impact of acquisitions on a reported basis.</p>
<p>Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled &euro;252.6 million, up +16.7% compared to Q4 2023. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 60.7%, up +2.9 points compared to Q4 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2024 was up +16.4%, to &euro;251.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 61.2%, up +3.4 points compared to the same perimeter in Q4 2023.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Q4 2024 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;49.6 million in Q4 2024, +8.7% more than in Q4 2023 due to the impact of migration projects and acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;20.7 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</p>
<p>Adjusted operating profit was &euro;231.1 million, up +17.7% compared to Q4 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating profit was up +17.3% compared to Q4 2023, at &euro;230.1 million.</p>
<p>&euro;39.3 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in Q4 2024, related to the final steps of the Borsa Italiana Group integration and the PPA of acquired businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Net financing income for Q4 2024 was &euro;6.5 million, compared to &euro;4.7 million in Q4 2023. This increase results from higher interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash generation, offsetting the cost of debt.</p>
<p>Results from equity investments amounted to &euro;10.1 million in Q4 2024, representing the dividend received from Sicovam. As a reminder, in Q4 2023, Euronext reported &euro;17.0 million of results from equity investments due to the capital gain related to the disposal of the stake in Tokeny and the dividend received from Sicovam.</p>
<p>Income tax for Q4 2024 was &euro;55.5 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.6% for the quarter. (Q4 2023: &euro;40.0 million and 22.6% respectively, reflecting the positive impact of the tax-exempted one-off capital gain from the disposal of the Tokeny stake).</p>
<p>Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;8.2 million in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, increased by +10.8% for Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023, to &euro;144.6 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;1.40 basic and &euro;1.39 diluted in Q4 2024, compared to &euro;1.25 basic and &euro;1.24 diluted in Q4 2023. Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +16.3% to &euro;172.3 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +16.9% in Q4 2024, at &euro;1.66 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;1.42 per share in Q4 2023. This increase reflects higher profit and a lower number of outstanding shares over the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weighted number of shares used over 2024 was 103,578,980 for the basic calculation and 103,983,870 for the diluted calculation, compared to 106,051,799 and 106,376,338 respectively over 2023.</p>
<p>In Q4 2024, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;175.0 million, compared to &euro;194.5 million in Q4 2023, reflecting negative changes in working capital from short-term movement in outstanding power sales customers&rsquo; and suppliers&rsquo; invoices related to Nord Pool CCP activities and higher income tax. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 64.3% of EBITDA in Q4 2024.</p>

<p>Power trading revenue reached &euro;11.3 million in Q4 2024, up +8.8% compared to Q4 2023, reflecting continued strong growth in intraday volumes and lower day-ahead volumes due to milder temperatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, power trading revenue was up +10.1% compared to Q4&nbsp;2023. This reflects the negative impact from the NOK depreciation on a reported basis.</p>

<p>Clearing revenue was up +1.8% to &euro;32.9<span>&nbsp;</span>million in Q4 2024, reflecting the increase in equity clearing volumes following the expansion of Euronext Clearing in November 2023, as well as dynamic commodity and retail bond clearing volumes, offset by the low volatility environment for equity derivatives. Euronext has internalised the clearing and net treasury income related to its derivatives flows in September 2024. Euronext therefore no longer receives revenue and net treasury income from LCH SA, previously recorded under non-volume related clearing revenue. Non-volume related clearing revenue, mostly related to membership fees, accounted for &euro;8.4 million of the total clearing revenue in Q4 2024. On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, clearing revenue was up +1.8% compared to Q4 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Net treasury income&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Net treasury income amounted to &euro;17.9 million in Q4 2024. The +53.3% increase compared to Q4 2023 reflects the increased level of cash collateral posted to the CCP following the migration of derivatives clearing for all Euronext markets to Euronext Clearing.</p>

<p>Corporate highlights since 1 January 2025</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext to acquire Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 28 January 2025, Euronext and Nasdaq announced the signing of a binding agreement under which Euronext will acquire Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business, subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The agreement entails the transfer of existing open positions in Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power derivatives, currently held in Nasdaq Clearing, to Euronext Clearing, with approval of the members. Trading of power futures will be operated from Euronext Amsterdam and will be cleared through Euronext Clearing. Nasdaq Clearing AB, Nasdaq Oslo ASA, and their respective infrastructure are not included in the sale. Nasdaq will continue to operate its European Markets Services business and multi-asset clearing house.</p>
<p>The anticipated combination of Euronext Nord Pool&rsquo;s market initiative with Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic power futures business is fully aligned with Euronext&rsquo;s &ldquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rdquo; strategic priority to expand in power and accelerates the delivery of Euronext&rsquo;s power futures ambitions. The transaction complies with Euronext&rsquo;s capital allocation policy and will be fully financed with existing cash.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext upgraded to A-, stable outlook, by S&amp;P</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 3 February 2025, Euronext welcomed the decision of S&amp;P to upgrade Euronext from &lsquo;BBB+, Positive Outlook&rsquo; to &lsquo;A-, Stable Outlook&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>S&amp;P&rsquo;s decision reflects the completion of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group, the successful expansion of Euronext Clearing and the continued deleveraging thanks to the Group's strong cash flow generation.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ongoing share buyback programme</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 7 November 2024, Euronext announced a share repurchase programme for a maximum amount of &euro;300 million. This programme is enabled by Euronext&rsquo;s strong cash generation capabilities and demonstrates Euronext&rsquo;s rigorous capital allocation strategy. Weekly reporting updates about the share repurchase programme are being published in the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/investor-relations/capital-and-shareholding/share-buyback-program">Share Buyback Programme</a>&nbsp;section of our website. As of 7 February 2025, a total of 1,821,023 shares had been repurchased, representing 65.3% of the repurchase programme.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fixed income derivatives status update</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext announces the launch of fixed income derivatives on major European government bonds, marking a significant innovation in financial derivatives. This new offering includes the first-ever mini futures to be cash-settled on European government bonds, designed to provide greater accessibility and flexibility for retail investors, asset managers, and private investors. Powered by the Optiq&reg; trading platform and supported by dedicated market makers and Euronext Clearing, these derivatives will be introduced on the Euronext Derivatives Milan market in September 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext volumes for January 2025</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In January 2025, the average daily transaction value on the Euronext cash order book stood at &euro;11,538 million, up 23.1% compared to the same period last year. The overall average daily volume on Euronext derivatives stood at 606,267 lots, up +5.1%% compared to January 2024, and the open interest was 23,064,793 contracts at the end of January 2025, up +4.5% compared to January 2024. The average daily volume on Euronext FX&rsquo;s spot foreign exchange market stood at $27.7 billion, up +11.2% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>MTS Cash average daily volumes were up +57.5% to &euro;50.8 billion in January 2025, MTS Repo term adjusted&nbsp;</p>
<p>average daily volume stood at &euro;467.6 billion, up +3.5% compared to the same period last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euronext Clearing cleared 23,472,063 shares in January 2025, +20.9% compared to January 2024. &euro;2,782.6 billion of wholesale bonds were cleared in January 2025 (double counted), up +2.8% compared to the same period in 2024. 1,464,522 bond retail contracts were cleared in January 2025 (double counted), up +11.9% compared to January 2024. The number of derivatives contracts cleared was 13,337,872, +606.4% compared to January 2024 (single counted). This strong increase is due to the fact that the commodity derivatives of Euronext legacy markets have been integrated following the Euronext Clearing expansion that occurred on 15 July 2024, and financial derivatives of Euronext legacy markets have been integrated following the Euronext Clearing expansion that occurred on 9 September 2024. Euronext Securities reported 13,048,702 settlement instructions in January 2025, up +14.9% compared to the same period last year. The total Assets Under Custody reached over &euro;7 trillion in January 2025, up +7.2%.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Euronext announces strategic collaboration with Euroclear to enhance Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management offering</span></li>
</ul>
<p>On 11 February 2025, Euronext announced a new collaboration with Euroclear to support the development of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management services for repo and other asset classes. This collaboration is a first major step to enable Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to expand its leading Italian repo clearing franchise to a large range of European government bonds bringing an efficient value offering to European and international clients. This collaboration will pave the way for the rollout of Euronext&rsquo;s new repo clearing offering in June 2025, enabling the onboarding of clients including international banks, with an updated risk framework. Clients will be able to use Euroclear as a triparty agent for repo clearing.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has launched today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-amendments-rts-settlement-discipline">consultation</a>&nbsp;on settlement discipline, with the objective of improving settlement efficiency across various areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA is consulting on a set of proposals to amend the technical standards on settlement discipline that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduced timeframes for allocations and confirmations,</li>
<li>the use of electronic, machine-readable allocations and confirmations according to international standards, and</li>
<li>the implementation of hold &amp; release and partial settlement by all central securities depositories.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA also wants to gather stakeholders' views on additional measures that could potentially enhance settlement efficiency, for which there are no specific policy proposals yet.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">This consultation takes into account the transition to T+1 in the European Union and the legislative proposal published by the Commission on 12 February 2025. &nbsp;It is aligned with the roadmap outlined in ESMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/ESMA74-2119945925-1969_Report_on_shortening_settlement_cycle.pdf">Final Report on Shortening the Settlement Cycle</a>.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will consider the feedback to this consultation until&nbsp;<span>14 April 2025</span>&nbsp;and expects to publish a final report and submit the draft technical standards to the European Commission (EC) by October 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies, organized jointly by the Saudi Ministry of Finance and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), kicks off next week February 16-17, 2025 in AlUla, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The annual high-level event is a prominent global platform aimed at promoting dialogue and cooperation regarding the economic challenges facing emerging markets, in the context of structural transformations of the global economy, by bringing together decision makers, prominent economists, and experts from around the world.</p>
<p>His Excellency the Saudi Minister of Finance, Mr. Mohammed&nbsp;Aljadaan, said the conference would be a unique platform for the exchange of knowledge, fostering informed decision-making and advancing policy discussions. It will provide an opportunity to engage on regional and global economic developments and to discuss policies and reforms aimed at promoting prosperity and resilience. This underscores the Kingdom's strong partnership with the IMF, and comes less than a year after the IMF established its regional office in Riyadh, to support the region's economies by providing technical assistance which contribute to achieving sustainable development for those countries.</p>
<p>Minister Aljadaan said the conference will discuss the economic challenges facing emerging markets and developing economies, including sluggish growth, constrained fiscal space, and rising financing needs while public debt is elevated. It will contribute to the provision of effective solutions to deal with these challenges. In addition, he said the Conference would highlight opportunities for emerging markets and developing economies to enhance cooperation and improve their economic growth and resilience.</p>
<p>Her Excellency the Managing Director of the IMF, Dr. Kristalina Georgieva, said "The inaugural AlUla Conference for Emerging Market Economies comes at a time of significant economic transformations. The Conference provides an important platform to bring together policymakers, the private sector, and key stakeholders to discuss ways in which emerging market countries can seize the opportunities of these economic transformations, lift up their competitiveness, and enjoy strong private sector-led growth".</p>
<p>"The joint Conference is a reflection of the deepening partnership between Saudi Arabia and the IMF, where Minister Aljadaan serves as Chair of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). This partnership is rooted in a common goal of building vibrant and resilient economies." Dr.&nbsp; Georgieva added.</p>
<p>The Conference will include several key sessions and themes, including monetary and fiscal policies concerning emerging markets and developing economies, the importance of those policies for macroeconomic and financial stability, and innovative solutions to sovereign debt management. It will also address the role of modern technology and artificial intelligence in supporting economic development.</p>

<title>REMIT Breach: French Regulator Fines Danske Commodities A/S €8 Million And Equinor ASA €4 Million For Manipulating The Gas Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 20 January 2025, the Dispute Settlement and Sanctions Committee (CoRDiS) of the French energy regulatory authority (CRE) imposed an &euro;8 million fine on Danske Commodities A/S and a &euro;4 million fine on Equinor ASA<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for manipulating annual capacity auctions at the virtual interconnection point between France and Spain (PIR Pirineos) in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>These penalties come under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGVw9QUARXB0wKU1BUHVYKBAIdUAkHURoGBABUBVFUVlADUgUdVwAAAlxVBQYdWw8DUh0GWlVRGgwBAwcZBAEAAAFXAARXBVoCRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011</a>, which prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>In its decision, CoRDiS found that Danske Commodities A/S, in collusion with Equinor ASA, had booked higher volumes of transmission capacity than those offered in the first round of PRISMA annual gas capacity auctions for PIR Pirineos in July 2019 and July 2020. This was done without the intention of acquiring such capacity, sending false or misleading signals regarding the demand for annual gas transmission capacity from France to Spain via the PIR Pirineos interconnection point.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that the objective of this behaviour was to create market congestion and prevent the application of multipliers to the prices of gas transmission capacities on the infra-annual market, which are meant to incentivise the booking of annual transmission capacities. By placing non-genuine offers in the first round of auctions for annual gas transmission capacity and creating congestion, Danske Commodities A/S and Equinor ASA prevented the application of multipliers, reducing the price of gas transmission capacities on the infra-annual market and setting the market price at an artificial level.</p>
<p>CoRDiS considers this behaviour a violation of REMIT Article 5, which prohibits actions that give&nbsp;or are likely to give&nbsp;false or misleading signals about the supply, demand, or price of wholesale energy products, or which secure or are likely to secure the price at an artificial level.</p>
<p>ACER welcomes this first REMIT decision of 2025 and appreciates CRE&rsquo;s continued efforts to strengthen market integrity.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The FCA has charged Mrs Lisa Campbell with multiple criminal offences, including fraud by abuse of position and providing false or misleading information to the FCA to conceal her wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mrs Campbell was the sole director of Campbell &amp; Associates Independent Financial Advice Ltd (Campbell &amp; Associates), an FCA authorised financial advisory firm which operated under the name Campbell &amp; Raffle Independent Financial Advice Ltd until November 2020. The firm provided financial advice on investments, insurance, and pensions, but was not authorised to hold or control client money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA alleges that between 1 April 2013 and 10 May 2023, Mrs Campbell misappropriated funds from clients on numerous occasions. The allegations include that Mrs Campbell created multiple false documents which she used to falsely reassure her clients that their money had been invested. In addition, the FCA alleges that Mrs Campbell provided false documents to the FCA in an effort to conceal her criminal behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the period, the FCA alleges that Mrs Campbell stole more than &pound;2.3m, leading to significant financial losses for multiple victims, including family members, friends and a vulnerable child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs Campbell has been released on bail and will appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on 17 April 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs Campbell&rsquo;s actions are a betrayal of trust on a massive scale. We allege she used her position to defraud clients out of millions, including vulnerable people and her own friends and family who relied on her for advice, using falsified documents to cover up her lies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We are determined to hold her accountable for her actions.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lisa Maureen Campbell was born on 6 January 1970.</li>
<li>This case took 24 months from opening in February 2023 to bringing criminal charges &ndash; compared to an average of 42 months for cases closed in 2023/24. This is an example of how the FCA is improving the pace of its enforcement investigations.</li>
<li>Fraud by abuse of position is an offence under sections 1 and 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 (6 offences).</li>
<li>Knowingly providing false information in purported compliance with a requirement imposed under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 is an offence under section 177 of the same Act.</li>
<li>Campbell &amp; Associates held FCA permissions from 4 October 2013 until 9 February 2023</li>
<li>On 9 February 2023, the FCA issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/restrictions-campbell-associates-independent-financial-advice-ltd" title="Restrictions placed on Campbell &amp; Associates Independent Financial Advice Ltd">First Supervisory Notice</a>&nbsp;to Campbell &amp; Associates, requiring the firm to cease regulated activities, notify customers and platform providers of the restrictions, and retain assets held by the firm.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On 3 April 2023, due to concerns that Mrs Campbell had not complied with restrictions imposed on the firm on 9 February 2023, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/supervisory-notices/first-supervisory-notice-lisa-campbell-campbell-associates-2023.pdf" title="first-supervisory-notice-lisa-campbell-campbell-associates-2023.pdf">imposed conditions</a>&nbsp;preventing Mrs Campbell from performing any activity for which she has approval without the FCA&rsquo;s written consent.</li>
<li>The FCA has been working with Hampshire Police in this investigation, which included Mrs Campbell&rsquo;s arrest and the seizure of evidence.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Consumers who believe they may have had funds misappropriated by Campbell &amp; Associates or Lisa Campbell can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/contact" title="Contact us">contact the FCA</a>.</li>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SET partners with</b><b> </b><b>The Institute of Internal Auditors</b><b> </b><b>of</b><b> Thailand to implement new internal audit standards, introducing 'Governance Trinity' - the synergy between AC, CEO, and CAE, while leveraging AI technology to enhance audit efficiency and transparency</b><b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>Reinforces critical roles of boards, executives, and investors in sustainable value creation</b><b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="firstmt-15">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), in collaboration with The Institute of Internal Auditors Thailand, hosted SET Sustainability Forum 1/2025 under the theme "Strengthening Market Resilience Through Audit Excellence" on February 13, 2025. The event brought together the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), governance experts, and listed company executives to share insights on elevating Thai corporate governance in alignment with new internal audit standards, while fostering AC-CEO-CAE collaboration.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>Professor Dr. Pornanong Budsaratragoon, SEC Secretary-General</b>, delivered a special keynote on "Strengthening Market Confidence Through Audit Excellence," emphasizing that strengthening governance and sustainable growth to enhance listed companies' value through robust internal control systems is not merely a compliance issue. Rather, company boards and audit committees should prioritize it as a "tone at the top" and strategic issue to establish adequate and appropriate internal control systems in listed companies.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Dr. Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>highlighted that amid global market volatility, technological disruption, and market dynamics, enhancing governance and internal audit standards is crucial for building investor trust. The collaboration between Audit Committee (AC), Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Chief Audit Executive (CAE) - the 'Governance Trinity' - will drive this transformation.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>Pongsak Sangsingkee, President of The Institute of Internal Auditors of Thailand, introduced</b> the new internal audit standards effective late 2024, developed to align with international benchmarks while considering Thai market context. The standards focus on strengthening AC-CEO-CAE collaboration to enhance corporate governance and sustainable value creation.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15">The forum featured two panel discussions:</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>1)</b> &ldquo;<b>The Governance Trinity: AC, CEO, and CAE Partnership</b><b>&rdquo;</b> joined by IIAT Director Suphamit Techamontrikul; Anuwat Jongyindee, Audit Committee Member, Pruksa Holding pcl; Sakchai Peechapat, Chief Executive Officer, TISCO Financial Group pcl; and Ammaraporn Sivasen, Executive Director, Country Function Head of Internal Audit, United Overseas Bank (Thai) pcl.</p>

<title>ACER Decides Not To Introduce Long-Term Transmission Rights For Hedging Between The Netherlands And Norway</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 16 August 2024, the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of the Netherlands&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPCQJUU1NVVUxaDwZUHVYBVwcdClxQVhoFAAEHVQYAAAUBAlUdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">asked ACER to decide</a>&nbsp;on how to address insufficient risk hedging opportunities at the bidding zone border between the Netherlands and Norway (NL-NO2).</p>
<p>After consulting with stakeholders in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsABVQIUVdcB0xcAQQHHVZdVgUdCl0GVRoFBlIFAQIHBQEHAlQdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">autumn 2024</a>&nbsp;and assessing the potential impact of long-term transmission rights (LTTRs) on this bidding zone border, ACER has now issued its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgdXBVEGAkwKA1VaHVZbVw4dUwsIAhoCXVYCAAQMVFcIBwkdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 02-2025</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why was a decision needed?</span></p>
<p>The Dutch and Norwegian NRAs found insufficient opportunities to hedge electricity prices in their respective bidding zones, which are important for market participants to hedge against price volatility and to mitigate uncertainty on future investment returns.</p>
<p>To address this issue, national regulators can request their Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue LTTRs, which are cross-border hedging tools enabling market players to manage price differences between bidding zones and reduce financial risks; or</li>
<li>Ensure the availability of other long-term cross-zonal hedging products that can support the functioning of the wholesale electricity market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Dutch and Norwegian regulators could not reach an agreement, the decision was referred to ACER and the EFTA Surveillance Authority.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What did ACER decide?</span></p>
<p>ACER decided against the introduction of long-term transmission rights on the NL-NO2 bidding zone border. ACER&rsquo;s assessment showed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTTRs would offer limited improvements to hedging opportunities in the Dutch and NO2 bidding zones;</li>
<li>Financial LTTRs on this border would likely be undervalued, resulting in higher costs for consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, ACER has asked the Dutch TSO to explore alternative measures to address insufficient hedging opportunities in these bidding zones.</p>
<p>The EFTA Surveillance Authority will issue a decision for Norway, following the procedure outlined in the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEUFUIBAVVV0xbV1ZRHVYOAlAdC1oJBxpWUFFTA1UCAAMFAQQdWQEAUFhVVwIdVQ0EBh0GWAdWGlcBBA4ZAAYFAQRXBlVWBQVYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EEA&nbsp; Agreement</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>The Dutch TSO has six months to submit an alternative hedging proposal to its NRA.</p>

<title>ESMA: Geopolitical And Macroeconomic Developments Driving Market Uncertainty</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA50-524821-3584_TRV_1_2025.pdf">first risk monitoring report of 2025</a>, setting out the key risk drivers currently facing EU financial markets. ESMA finds that overall risks in EU securities markets are high, and market participants should be wary of potential market corrections.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Verena Ross, ESMA&rsquo;s Chair, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;Financial markets remain optimistic, but recent events show that confidence is fragile, including in Europe. The evolution of economic growth, global monetary policy and geopolitics remains uncertain, and this gives rise to key risk drivers.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Market participants need to keep their eyes firmly on growing risks, from possible corrections in surging markets such as cryptos, to the threat of disruption from increasingly sophisticated and frequent cyber-attacks.</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>The difficult funding environment, particularly for equity financing, in Europe identified in the report also shows just how important it is to strengthen European capital markets.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>As global financial markets continue to soar, downside risks are mounting. This is especially visible from an EU perspective where economic and political uncertainties are weighing on markets and where market-based corporate financing remains lacklustre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contagion risk is also set to worsen given surging asset prices in a context of highly interconnected global markets. Crypto markets have recently hit record highs and continue to illustrate the growing risks from social-media-driven investing for investors with limited knowledge. More positively, credit risk should ease as lower interest rates feed through.</p>
<p>ESMA&rsquo;s report provides an update on structural developments and the status of key sectors of financial markets, during the second half of 2024.</p>
<h4><span>Structural developments</span></h4>
<p><span>Market-based finance:</span>&nbsp;The financing of European corporates lost momentum in 2024. The market environment remains challenging, and equity issuance stayed weak overall. Corporate bond issuance fell slightly in 2H24 but remained close to historically high levels. Given the upcoming corporate bond maturity wall from 2025 to 2028, with 47% of debt maturing in this period, debt sustainability remains a risk.</p>
<p><span>Sustainable finance:&nbsp;</span>Uncertainty linked to the direction of global climate policy continued to grow in 2H24. A renewed need to consolidate public finances in advanced economies raised questions on government abilities to finance the transition, while slower ESG investing momentum signalled a drop in appetite for &lsquo;green&rsquo; products. Yet, the strength of the EU green bond market, underpinned by non-financial corporate issuance, suggests a broader greening of the economy continues.</p>
<p><span>Financial innovation:&nbsp;</span>Crypto-asset prices boomed after the US election, with the new administration&rsquo;s pro-crypto stance fuelling market optimism. Bitcoin rose 30% and meme coins, including the largest, Dogecoin, saw their values surge. Total capitalisation of crypto assets rose to EUR&nbsp;3.3tn by end-2024, 27% above the historical peak of November 2021. These events prompted ESMA to renew its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA35-1872330276-1971_Warning_on_crypto-assets.pdf">warning</a>&nbsp;on the highly speculative nature of crypto-assets.</p>
<h4><span>Market monitoring</span></h4>
<p><a><span>Securities markets:&nbsp;</span></a>European equity valuations declined in 4Q24, extending the divergence between EU and US equities. In the EU, considerable disparities in sectoral and country performance persisted.&nbsp;In fixed income markets, corporate bond spreads reached historical lows, especially in the high-yield segment. Search-for-yield behaviour and excessive risk-taking by end investors could lead to pricing misalignments and to abrupt repricing when economic conditions change.</p>
<p><a><span>Asset management:&nbsp;</span></a>In&nbsp;2H24, EU fund asset growth was due to valuation effects, with most categories performing positively amid muted flows. Overall EU equity fund performance outperformed EU indices reflecting a growing exposure to the US. This could expose these funds to higher market risks given signs of overvaluation in US equities. Leverage remains high for hedge funds and commercial real estate fund valuation has not adjusted substantially to underlying prices.</p>
<p><a><span>Consumers:</span></a>&nbsp;Confidence in future market conditions was weak and sentiment in current market conditions reached a two-year low, despite improvements in the aggregate financial position of households. Consumers continued to increase their direct and indirect exposures to bonds amid higher interest rates. Average performance of retail investments also improved in 2024, with positive performance in equity, bond, alternative and mixed funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a><span>Infrastructures and services:&nbsp;</span>Cyber risks continue to grow amid geopolitical tensions. In 2H24, equity-trading volumes remained high (+23% year-on-year). Settlement failure rates decreased, continuing a positive trend observed since the implementation of CSDR in 2022.&nbsp;</a>There was a small decrease in the number of outstanding credit ratings, associated with a decline in financial and&nbsp;particularly covered bond ratings.</p>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-revision-disclosure-framework-private-securitisation">consultation</a>&nbsp;on revising the disclosure framework for private securitisations under the Securitisation Regulation (SECR).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ESMA12-2121844265-4462_-_Consultation_Paper_on_Private_Securitisation.pdf">consultation</a>&nbsp;proposes a simplified disclosure template for private securitisations designed to improve proportionality in information-sharing processes while ensuring that supervisory authorities retain access to the essential data for effective oversight. The new template introduces aggregate-level reporting and streamlined requirements for transaction-specific data, reflecting the operational realities of private securitisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal of the simplified template follows ESMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-securitisation-disclosure-templates">previous consultation</a>, &nbsp;where industry stakeholders called for short-term solutions to address key challenges and advocated for a simplified template for private securitisations. A summary of these responses was published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/ESMA12-2121844265-3972_-_Feedback_statement_Securitisation_disclosure_templates.pdf">December 2024 Feedback Statement</a>.</p>
<p>It also adds to the recently announced ESMA initiative on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-contributes-simplification-and-burden-reduction">simplification and burden reduction</a>&nbsp;actions, while preserving the main objectives of financial stability, orderly markets and investor protection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p>ESMA will work closely with the European Commission (EC) to explore whether adjustments to the technical standards, particularly regarding disclosures for private securitisations, can be implemented before the review of the regulation itself.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>
<div class="elementToProof">Duco, the leading enterprise platform for data automation, is pleased to announce that it has joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative &mdash; a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation and disclosure of responsible business practices.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">With this announcement, Duco is proud to join thousands of other companies globally committed to taking responsible business action to create the world we all want.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">During 2024, Duco engaged in a multi-million dollar replatforming to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the firm&rsquo;s energy usage, which enabled it to reduce its hosting emissions by 16% even as the customer base grew by 46%. The firm offset 100% of its emissions from the previous reporting period, invested in nascent technology that permanently removes carbon from the environment, and also switched to 100% renewable energy for its data centres.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The&nbsp;<span><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://unglobalcompact.org/" id="OWA7ed7ecec-3eba-350e-5f42-8db43f0a5fbf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UN Global Compact</a></span>&nbsp;is a call to companies everywhere to align their operations and strategies with&nbsp;<span><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles" id="OWAde935d1e-af04-9c59-56ec-f34da064dfa5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ten universally accepted principles</a></span>&nbsp;in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to take action in support of UN goals and issues embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Launched in 2000, the UN Global Compact is the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world, with more than 15,000 companies and 3,800 non-business signatories based in over 160 countries, and more than 69 Local Networks.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Danielle Price, CFO and Head of Sustainability, Duco</b>, said: &ldquo;As a private company, we&rsquo;re not obligated to report on ESG matters, but we take our role in society very seriously and we&rsquo;re committed to making a positive impact on our environment and communities. This is true across the organisation, from our exec team through to our passionate engineers who are constantly making improvements to our platform, reducing our impact on the environment. Joining the Compact marks the latest in a series of commitments we&rsquo;re making to do our part in creating a fair, equitable and sustainable world.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&ldquo;Those actions have a broader impact, as through our products, we help banks and other organisations collectively reduce carbon emissions by utilising greener technology. We were able to demonstrate a reduction of emissions in the region of 60-80% on a reconciliation use case for our existing customers moving to public cloud following our multi-million dollar investment. That&rsquo;s a significant global environmental impact if you consider how many firms still operate on on-premise software. If we&rsquo;re serious about making a difference to the environment, the choice has to be solutions in the cloud with a passion for sustainability in their DNA.&rdquo;</div>

<p><span><span>Global deal activity (mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A), private equity (PE) and venture financing) experienced an 8.4% decline year-on-year (YoY) in January 2025 with decrease in deal volume observed across all the regions.

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The decline in deal activity across all the regions reflects the current challenges and uncertainties.

<p><span><span>On the other hand, the total number of deals announced in North America, Middle East and Africa, and South and Central American regions were down by 1.9%, 5.5% and 23.8%, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Among the select key markets, China, the UK, Canada, South Korea, France and Australia experienced YoY decline in their deal volume by 30.4%, 20.5%, 18.9%, 28.3%, 16.7% and 17.3% respectively, while markets such as India, Japan, and Germany showed improvement in deal activity by 27.3%, 35% and 8.2%, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile the trend remained a mixed bag across the different deal types under coverage. Venture financing deals volume saw YoY decline of 9.4% during January 2025 while the number of M&amp;A deals fell by 8.6%. However, private equity deals experienced improvement in volume by 4.5% during the review period.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;The data reveals a challenging landscape for global deal activity, with a broad decline in deal volumes, particularly in certain key markets. In this shifting environment, it will be crucial for investors to stay vigilant, closely monitor these trends, and adjust their strategies to effectively navigate the evolving market dynamics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak today about stablecoins, an important innovation for the crypto ecosystem with the potential to improve retail and cross-border payments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;A little over three years ago, I outlined my views on the benefits and risks of stablecoins.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I can think of no better place than this conference to discuss the maturing stablecoin market and examine potential challenges that could impede stablecoins from reaching their full potential.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this speech, I define stablecoins as a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national currency and backed at least one-to-one with safe and liquid assets. Specifically, a pool of assets is held in reserve so that stablecoins can be redeemed for traditional currency in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Stablecoins&mdash;as with any means of payment&mdash;must demonstrate 1) a clear&nbsp;<em>use case</em>&nbsp;and 2) a clear&nbsp;<em>commercial case&nbsp;</em>to be economically viable. These terms are often conflated, but they are different, and both are necessary. Having a use case is how you attract consumers and businesses, while a business model is necessary for issuers of stablecoins to continue operating. As private sector innovators look to expand on the use cases of stablecoins and seek to achieve scale, what might emerge as challenges or roadblocks? This is a question I will explore today, including from a public sector perspective. Of course, as a policymaker, I am not here to endorse any of these use cases or business models, and what follows is not advice or recommendations. Rather, I am discussing them to underscore the varied ecosystem that policymakers must understand.</p>
<p>I will begin by explaining some of the use cases of stablecoins, including those that are well established and those that are still emerging. The primary use of stablecoins is as a safe crypto store of value. In the early days of crypto trading, buying and selling crypto meant trading one crypto-asset for another crypto-asset. As we have seen, crypto prices can fluctuate substantially, which means crypto-assets that are not anchored as stablecoins suffer from price risk. All financial markets crave the existence of a safe, low-risk asset which allows traders to move out of risky positions into safe ones where the safe asset price is known and stable. The beauty of financial innovation is that if a market demands such an asset, someone will figure out how to supply it. Thus, stablecoins were born.</p>
<p>A stablecoin's value is tied to a national fiat currency, with the U.S. dollar being the fiat currency of choice for most stablecoins. In this sense, stablecoins are synthetic dollars. In our everyday life, the dollar serves as a medium of exchange and a unit of account. By their tie to the dollar, stablecoins are the medium of exchange and unit of account in the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>But how does one trade a "real" dollar for a "synthetic" dollar, like a stablecoin? Exchanges already allowed agents to move in and out of the crypto ecosystem but doing so took time and money. Stablecoins provided a marketplace solution to this problem&mdash;a means to represent dollars on exchanges so that transactions could be carried out more quickly and efficiently. Currently, stablecoins are involved in over 80 percent of trading volume on major centralized crypto exchanges.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>A second stablecoin use case is providing a means to access and hold U.S. dollars. Today, around 99 percent of stablecoin market capitalization is denominated in U.S. dollars, and the vast majority of digital asset trades are priced in U.S. dollars.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;This is no surprise given the primacy of the U.S. dollar in global finance and trade, and I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services.</p>
<p>A third use case is cross-border payments. For example, we are hearing increased industry focus on the "stablecoin sandwich" model of cross-border payments, in which fiat currency in one country is converted first into a U.S. dollar stablecoin, then that stablecoin is transferred to another individual, and then finally the stablecoin is converted back into the local fiat currency at its destination. This has the potential to reduce the complexity of a series of correspondent banking networks, improving transparency, cost, and timeliness. As this use case develops, it is critical that market participants implement all anti-money laundering and relevant consumer safeguards.</p>
<p>The last use case I will describe is in retail payments. At present, stablecoin use for retail payments is very limited. However, I am seeing a lot of new, private sector entrants looking to find ways to support the use of stablecoins for retail payments. For example, firms that provide point-of-sale technology are acquiring innovative fintechs or developing their own capabilities to accept stablecoins for retail purchases. This provides consumers with yet another option. Firms are also looking to incorporate stablecoins&mdash;and crypto more broadly&mdash;into peer-to-peer payment apps.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether stablecoins will scale for retail payment use cases. Such an evolution would require both a substantial number of consumers to shift their preferences toward using stablecoins and a significant number of businesses to make necessary investments to receive payments via stablecoins. We know that consumer retail payments behavior is sticky, and when behavior does change, it generally happens over a long period. If retail payments use cases do increase, it would probably take years to have a significant impact. That said, if stablecoins reduce transaction fees or allow merchants to attract customers, then merchants could have an incentive to accept them. Ultimately, the market will sort out whether consumers and businesses have the incentives to use stablecoins in this way.</p>
<p>In addition to stablecoins having clear cut use cases, issuers must have a viable business model. To cite one famous example, Red Lobster's endless shrimp deal was popular with customers, but it did not turn out to be a sustainable model for the restaurant chain. Let me describe what I think are the incentives for stablecoin issuers, but I am here today to learn more.</p>
<p>To date, most stablecoin issuers appear to generate revenue primarily by earning higher returns on their reserve assets than they incur in expenses. They issue a zero-interest liability and use the proceeds to acquire interest earning assets, thereby profiting from the spread. As with bank deposits, the interest rate environment will have a significant effect on the profitability of firms issuing stablecoins. Higher interest rates generally mean higher rates of return on reserve assets, which generates revenue for the issuer. However, higher interest rates also have the potential to make non-interest bearing assets less attractive for consumers to hold. That said, users who hold stablecoins as an accessible, safe store of U.S. dollar denominated value may not be particularly sensitive to the interest rate environment, a phenomenon we already see today with some holders of physical U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>An additional way stablecoin issuers can generate revenue is through fees. This could include charging minting and burning fees, which occur when a customer acquires a new stablecoin for a real dollar or wants to redeem it for real dollars. This is very much like the foreign exchange market in fiat currencies that most of us are familiar with. Alternatively, as occurs with most payments firms, the issuer could earn money from transaction fees.</p>
<p>Finally, stablecoin issuers may use stablecoins as part of a broader strategy to attract customers to whom they may sell other products and services. In that case, stablecoins could be seen as a "loss leader" to entice customers to use other products or services offered by the stablecoin issuer that are much more profitable.</p>
<p>With the exception of the last example, the viability of the other business models will depend on the ability of stablecoins to scale as a means of payment and on how consumers and businesses respond. For example, if the stablecoin issuer decides to pass through interest earnings on its assets, that will make the stablecoin more attractive, but it will reduce the profits from issuing a stablecoin. The smaller the interest rate spread, the more important scale becomes. For the fee-based models, free entry into this space will drive down fees as it does in any other market, which will reduce the revenue from issuing a stablecoin.</p>
<p>Within this market, scale is important for achieving certain use cases as well as satisfying certain business models. For example, stablecoins are unlikely to become a viable option for retail payments if consumers question whether stablecoins will be widely accepted as a means of payment, while stablecoin issuers cannot generate significant revenue from interest on backing assets or fees without scale. I call this the "Field of Dreams" problem&mdash;if you build it, will they come?</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, let's now dive into some of the potential challenges or roadblocks that will need to be overcome for stablecoins to achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>The first theme I will explore is one that I have discussed in the past&mdash;the safety and soundness of stablecoins and the need for a clear regulatory regime for stablecoins in the United States.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Stablecoins are forms of private money and, like any form of private money, are subject to run risk, and we have seen "depegs" of some stablecoins in recent years. Additionally, all payment systems face risk of failure, and stablecoins are subject to clearing, settlement, and other payment system risks as well. At the same time, it is important to note that the risks faced by stablecoin issuers are not the same risks faced by banks. The stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework that addresses stablecoin risks directly, fully, and narrowly. This framework should allow both non-banks and banks to issue regulated stablecoins and should consider the effects of regulation on the payments landscape, including competing payment instruments.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that I think it is important that U.S. legislation makes provision for the supervision and regulation of stablecoin issuers that is proportionate to the risks they pose, without stifling their innovative potential while the marketplace is still developing. I believe in the power of the private sector to develop solutions that benefit businesses and consumers, with the job of the public sector to create a fair set of rules for market participants to operate within, including guardrails that ensure safety for consumers and the financial system as a whole. Having a level of certainty is important for businesses looking to invest in new products and services as well as for consumer confidence and assurance.</p>
<p>Fragmentation is the next theme I'll explore, first from a technical perspective. Currently, several popular blockchain networks are designed as distinct from one another. Firms looking to scale across blockchains are seeking technical solutions to achieve cross-chain interoperability. Will this ultimately prove efficient, especially in a world with multiple stablecoin providers operating within potentially different combinations of blockchain networks? Or will there be multiple, competing ecosystems, for example where one stablecoin dominates on certain blockchains, and another stablecoin dominates on others? Alternatively, a stablecoin market featuring a high degree of interoperability could support a variety of stablecoin issuers and blockchain networks, providing consumers a choice in stablecoins and technologies. It is not yet clear how these dynamics will ultimately impact business models and use cases for stablecoins, but it is an issue that bears watching as firms work to scale and mature their businesses.</p>
<p>Fragmentation around the use and acceptance of stablecoins will also act as an impediment to scaling and will impact how stablecoin use cases develop. As I noted, stablecoins will prove useful as a means of payment insofar as holders of a specific stablecoin expect that others will accept them. The more people will accept a stablecoin, the more convenient a stablecoin will be. For the retail payment use case, how easy will it be for me as a consumer to pay with stablecoins at the point of sale, either in-person or online? From the merchant perspective, what incentives will firms have to accept stablecoins? Similarly, for cross-border payments, how widely will different firms (and their banking partners) transact in stablecoins? And, more broadly, could stablecoins have the potential to recreate and potentially exacerbate the current challenges associated with correspondent banking, further fragmenting the marketplace? Or could stablecoins mature in such a way to change the market structure of cross-border payments?</p>
<p>Fragmentation in regulation also has the potential to hold stablecoins back from reaching their full potential. As I already discussed, the stablecoin market does not have a clear regulatory framework in the United States. While there have been efforts to develop some international standards, the emergence of different global stablecoin regulatory regimes creates the potential for conflicting regulation domestically and internationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This regulatory fragmentation could make it difficult for U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers to operate at a global scale. And as I have noted, scale is vital for any means of payment to achieve its full potential.</p>
<p>For example, under Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, stablecoin issuers can earn interest on their reserve assets as a business model, whereas other regulatory models being discussed would require reserves for stablecoins deemed systemically important to be held as non-interest-bearing central bank deposits, limiting stablecoin issuers into a specific business model. Domestically, state regulators have been key players in the development of the stablecoin market, and several states are in the process of developing state laws or finalizing new regulations related to stablecoin issuance. There is a risk that state regulations may conflict, which could prevent the use of the same stablecoin across all states and reduce stablecoin scalability. As with the United States' dual banking system, a complementary framework with state and federal regulators working together can allow innovation to flourish while achieving some of the benefits of scale that come with a harmonized set of market rules.</p>
<p>Different regulatory regimes are also creating separate reserve asset and redemption requirements for stablecoin issuers&mdash;a further potential regulatory regime fragmentation. In Europe, non-systemic stablecoin issuers are required to hold a minimum of 30 percent of their backing assets in bank deposits, and regulators have further proposed concentration limits per bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This differs from the requirements of some U.S. state-regulated issuers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250212a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;To operate at a global scale, stablecoin issuers would therefore have to issue the same stablecoin under multiple regimes with separate reserve asset and redemption requirements. Will this be efficient and ultimately prove workable if the number of regulatory regimes domestically and internationally continue to grow? Will we expect a stablecoin issuer to rebalance its reserves when a stablecoin is transferred between users in different countries or U.S. states? Creating consistency at the federal level could allow federal authorities to negotiate with foreign counterparts to ensure global regulations serve the interests of U.S. consumers and businesses and allow the U.S. to be a regulation setter for an asset class primarily denominated in our national unit of account.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my hope is that the stablecoin market will grow or diminish on the merits of their benefits to consumers and the broader economy. For the private sector, that means continuing to develop innovative solutions that fit a market need while building sustainable business models. And for the public sector, it means setting clear and targeted legal and regulatory frameworks and coordinating those frameworks across states and national boundaries to enable private sector innovation at a global scale.</p>

<title>Statement On Staff Legal Bulletin 14M, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Feb. 12, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-crenshaw-fe-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-sec-commissioner-caroline-a-crenshaw-fe-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, under the direction of the Acting Chairman, Staff Legal Bulletin 14L is now rescinded by the issuance of Staff Legal Bulletin 14M (&ldquo;SLB 14M&rdquo;). SLB 14M moves the goalposts smack dab in the middle of this year&rsquo;s shareholder proposal process. Doing so at this hour creates undue costs and uncertainty for investors and corporations alike. This type of political policy shifting mid-season serves to undercut capital formation, not facilitate it.</p>
<p>SLB 14M implements different rules of the road for the process of excluding shareholder proposals from issuers&rsquo; proxy statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Such proposals include topics relating to poison pills, compensation, emerging issues such as AI, political and lobbying expenditures, and environmental or other issues that shareholders have identified as materially impacting the firm&rsquo;s financial value.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The fact that the change is taking place at this time is significant. As anyone familiar with the shareholder proposal process knows, excluding a proposal from the proxy statement all but guarantees it will never make it to a shareholder vote.</p>
<p>The rescission comes as no surprise given that the shareholder proposal process has become the target of politicized messaging and a preferred punching bag of those who wish to diminish corporate democracy. This is the case even though there are already numerous other mechanisms in place to limit the availability of the proxy ballot to shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Though the shareholder proposal process is designed merely to facilitate a dialogue with investors, today&rsquo;s actions drowns out investor voices and facilitates corporate monologues instead.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-staff-legal-bulletin-14m-021225#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Even though the rescission may not be a surprise, the timing of this action is arbitrary and inequitable. Shareholders have already crafted and submitted their proposals for this season. Corporations and shareholders will incur costs to supplement or alter no-action requests and responses. Further, SEC staff have already issued no-action letter responses related to proposals for this proxy season. Even for those stakeholders and observers who prefer a different approach to this process, the end result is quite possibly disparate treatment not just for shareholders, but for issuers as well. We are so focused on undoing the prior Commission&rsquo;s agenda that we sow chaos now. By choosing this path, we forsake all consistency, and perhaps even the legitimacy, of the independent, historically staff-governed process to the detriment of all parties.</p>
<p>While costly and confusing, corporations will still have a chance to revise their no-action requests to exclude proposals. Shareholders, of course, will have no such opportunity. The 14a-8 no-action process is fact-intensive, and exactly how a proposal is crafted is often determinative of its exclusion or inclusion. It is now too late for most shareholders to design proposals in line with SLB 14M.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a measured approach that would ensure market stability and a meaningful consideration of cost and benefit, this leadership has rushed out staff guidance for the sake of political expediency, and at significant cost to shareholders, corporations, and SEC staff resources.</p>

<title>ISDA Annual Legal Forum, February 12, 2025, Opening Remarks, Katherine Tew Darras, ISDA General Counsel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and welcome to the Annual Legal Forum in London. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you to Cleary Gottlieb for sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, 2025 is an important year for ISDA as we mark our 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary. In 1985, a small group of dealers established ISDA, then called the International Swap Dealers Association, to develop standards for the nascent interest rate swaps market, which had become bogged down by a lack of standard terms and a growing documentation backlog.</p>
<p>Forty years on, much has changed. We started out with 10 dealers, mainly based in New York. Today, we have more than 1,000 members in 76 countries, with end users making up the largest part of the membership. ISDA&rsquo;s very first document, published in 1985, was the Code of Standard Wording, Assumptions and Provisions for Swaps, which essentially provided a dictionary of common terms that parties could use in their contracts. Today, ISDA&rsquo;s suite of industry documentation reaches far and wide, with more than 160 documents and document versions now available in digital form on ISDA MyLibrary.</p>
<p>But some things have remained unchanged. What was groundbreaking in 1985 was the willingness of market participants to sit around a table and work together to address shared challenges. With a growing backlog of bespoke documentation, standardization was desperately needed to bring greater efficiency and enable the market to scale. Forty years later, ISDA is many times bigger and the challenges are different, but collaboration, standardization and the development of industry solutions remain at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I&rsquo;ll talk about several areas where we&rsquo;re currently collaborating with our membership to bring greater efficiency and standardization to derivatives documentation and vital processes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with document digitization.</p>
<p>I mentioned ISDA MyLibrary a moment ago, which is an online hub that houses core ISDA documentation in digital form. But ISDA&rsquo;s commitment to digitization doesn&rsquo;t just apply to the documents themselves. ISDA Create, which is available through S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform, enables firms to digitally generate and execute documentation and then seamlessly capture, process and store the data from those negotiations. This improves speed and efficiency, enabling firms to accelerate the onboarding of new counterparties. More than 500 buy- and sell-side entities around the world are now experiencing the benefits of ISDA Create.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not standing still. Following extensive development and testing, we&rsquo;re now working with Linklaters to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) to ISDA Create, unlocking powerful new efficiencies for those users that feel ready for it.</p>
<p>The first new feature is CiQ Extract, which allows agreements to be negotiated offline and then seamlessly re-uploaded and mapped back onto the platform. This is a big step forward because it supports those counterparties that might prefer to negotiate their contracts in the traditional way, while still enabling those documents, and the data within them, to be captured on ISDA Create. Using AI, we can bridge the gap between offline negotiations and digital continuity, mapping the extracted data back to the original digital template and maintaining a single repository for contract negotiations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing AI to summarize the lengthy comment chains that can appear as documents are negotiated on ISDA Create. Firms will be encouraged to review the output themselves, but the ability to have comments summarized by a machine opens the door to even greater speed and efficiency when using ISDA Create. We are demonstrating this feature outside at the ISDA Create booth, so please do take a look.</p>
<p>As we continue to unlock improvements in documentation, we&rsquo;re also collaborating with members to address bottlenecks in other industry processes. One such area is the physical delivery and receipt of critical notices, a key step in the process of terminating a counterparty relationship.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, termination-related notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods using the counterparty&rsquo;s address as listed in the agreement. This has long been problematic if a counterparty has moved offices without updating the address details in the documentation. But more recent issues emerged during the pandemic lockdowns, making it extremely difficult to deliver or receive notices because offices were closed.</p>
<p>This is a serious issue with economic consequences. Delays and uncertainty over the delivery of notices can lead to losses running to millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The good news is that we&rsquo;re moving forward at pace with the development of the ISDA Notices Hub, an online platform that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of notices from anywhere in the world. It will also maintain a golden source of updated address details for those counterparty relationships where physical delivery of notices will continue.</p>
<p>Last year, ISDA undertook an industry outreach exercise that showed strong support for this initiative from buy- and sell-side institutions globally. Use of the Notices Hub will be free for the buy side and we&rsquo;re also developing a protocol that will incorporate delivery of notices in this way as an acceptable option into existing agreements. This protocol will be free of charge to everyone. Like ISDA Create, the Notices Hub will be available on Counterparty Manager, which means firms will be able to access a wide range of functionality, including the negotiation of documents and the delivery and receipt of notices. This creates a full ecosystem for client onboarding, documentation and integral data points.</p>
<p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;ll briefly bring you up to date on the review of ISDA&rsquo;s 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions.</p>
<p>This project got underway last year in response to industry feedback on the need to update the definitions to reflect the nature of today&rsquo;s FX market. This is a market that trades around the clock and across the world, and it has grown from an average daily turnover of $1.5 trillion in 1998 to $7.5 trillion in 2022.</p>
<p>While the contractual terms applicable to FX derivatives have evolved with the addition of supplemental publications over the years, we found strong industry support for a review and consolidation of the definitions. In particular, there was widespread demand to revisit the provisions relating to disruption events and fallbacks to create greater certainty in the event of future geopolitical shocks. We&rsquo;re also taking a close look at other aspects of the definitions, including the treatment of unexpected holidays that may be announced after the forward price has been set.</p>
<p>The review of the FX definitions is now well advanced and we expect to complete the drafting later this year, with implementation targeted for the end of 2027.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked in these remarks about three areas where ISDA is working with members to bring improvements to vital industry documents and processes. It&rsquo;s a set of issues that the pioneers of ISDA would never have imagined when they first convened in the 1980s. But I think they&rsquo;d recognize the same spirit of collaboration and quest for mutualized solutions that drove the development of the very first ISDA documentation. The issues change, the challenges evolve, but the process endures.</p>
<p>In ISDA&rsquo;s 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, it&rsquo;s my great pleasure to welcome you to this flagship event. We have a great set of panels and presentations lined up, and I hope you find them engaging and insightful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Its Final Draft Technical Standards To Implement A Centralised EBA Pillar 3 Data Hub</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the Pillar 3 data hub for large and other institutions, which will centralise prudential disclosures by institutions through a single electronic access point on the EBA website. This project is part of the Banking Package laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6).</span></p>
<p>The ITS detail the IT solutions and processes to be followed by large and other institutions when submitting their respective Pillar 3 disclosures. This includes the IT solutions to be used, the data exchange formats to be considered and the technical validations to be performed by the EBA. The EBA will provide additional detailed information to the submitters of Pillar 3 information in the onboarding communication plan it expects to publish by the end of the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>To submit the information to the EBA, institutions will benefit from a transition period for the information with disclosure reference dates from June to December 2025. This will give them enough time to prepare for the new publication process.</p>
<p>In parallel, the EBA finalised a pilot exercise on a voluntary basis to test the process for large and other institutions. When finalising the draft ITS, the EBA has taken on board the conclusions from this pilot exercise, together with the feedback received during the&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-consults-draft-technical-standards-support-centralised-eba-pillar-3-data-hub">consultation</a>&nbsp;phase.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis, backgrounds and next steps</span></p>
<p>The new Banking Package (CRR3/CRD6), which will implement the latest Basel III reforms in the EU, includes a mandate to the EBA to develop a Pillar 3 data hub. The EBA&rsquo;s plan on how to implement the mandates included in the Banking Package is explained in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package">'EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework'</a>, published in December 2023.</p>
<p>The CRR3 (Articles 434 and 434a) mandates the EBA to publish on its website the prudential disclosures for all institutions subject to such requirements, making it readily available in a centralised manner to all the relevant stakeholders through a single electronic access point on its website. To comply with this mandate, the EBA is building a data hub putting together all the disclosures required under Part Eight of the CRR.</p>
<p>The draft ITS for small and non-complex institutions and on the resubmission policy will be subject to a separate consultation, intended to be launched in the first half of 2025.</p>

<title>KDPW: New Website And LEI Issuance Application</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/kdpw-new-website-and-lei-issuance-application-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/kdpw-new-website-and-lei-issuance-application-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>As of 10 February 2025, KDPW has launched a new website and LEI issuance application, available at the same address as before:&nbsp;</b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lei.kdpw.pl/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b></b></a><b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lei.kdpw.pl/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.lei.kdpw.pl/</a></b><b>. The project developed an additional API module to ensure communication between the online application and the IT system.</b></p>
<p>The modifications made to the electronic LEI request make the process of getting an LEI much shorter. The LEI request has also been largely simplified.</p>
<p>The new website features an LEI database where users can easily check the expiry date of the LEI; a search engine to find the LEI of any company and access high-quality data assigned to the LEI; information on discounts available for multi-year payments; and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
<p>Logged-in clients can request a new LEI; download free of charge a certificate confirming the registration of the LEI; download an invoice; update the company details assigned to the LEI; and renew the LEI.</p>
<p>LEIs are issued for a specific period of time and must be renewed. LEIs are issued by Local Operating Units (LOUs) accredited by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF). KDPW is the only Polish entity authorised to issue LEIs. KDPW issues LEIs for entities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the UK.</p>
<p>Currently KDPW manages a database of 33,700 LEIs.</p>
<p>The LEI (Legal Entity Identifier) is a 20-character alpha-numeric globally unique legal entity identifier compliant with ISO17442. Each LEI is linked to key information about the legal entity that holds the LEI, which enables the identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions worldwide.</p>
<p>LEIs are mandatory for entities active in the financial markets, including banks, credit institutions, brokers, financial intermediaries, pension funds, investment funds, as well as non-financial entities, such as companies, individuals who carry out business activities in all areas of the economy, and local governments.</p>

our ability to continue introducing innovative and competitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis, including through our electronic trading capabilities, and derive revenues that are commensurate with our efforts and expectations, our ability to maintain the competitiveness of our existing products and services; our ability to adjust our fixed costs and expenses if our revenues decline; our ability to manage variable costs relating to&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;transition to the&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud and&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud platform and minimize duplicative costs during the transition between maintaining the on-premise environment and the&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud environment; our ability to maintain existing customers at substantially similar trading levels, develop strategic relationships and attract new customers; our ability to expand and globally offer our products and services; changes in regulations, including the impact of any changes in laws or government policies with respect to our products or services or our industry, such as any changes to regulations and policies that require increased financial and operational resources from us or our customers, as well as the impact of tariffs and tax policy changes, restrictions on our ability to offer&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;products and services in specific geographies or to specific customers or limitations or changes in underlying/physical product flows across geographies; the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights and our ability to operate our business without violating the intellectual property rights of others; decreases in revenue from our market data as a result of decreased demand or changes to regulations in various jurisdictions; changes in our rate per contract due to shifts in the mix of the products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure; the ability of our credit and liquidity risk management practices to adequately protect us from the credit risks of clearing members and other counterparties, and to satisfy the margin and liquidity requirements associated with the BrokerTec matched principal business; the ability of our compliance and risk management programs to effectively monitor and manage our risks, including our ability to prevent errors and misconduct and protect our infrastructure against security breaches and misappropriation of our intellectual property assets; our dependence on third-party providers and exposure to risk through third parties, including risks related to the performance, reliability and security of technology used by our&nbsp;</i><i>third-party providers and third party providers that our clients and third-parties rely on; our reliance on third-party distribution partners, including independent software vendors (ISVs), Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs), introducing brokers, broker-dealers around the world, regulatory reporting and data distributors and platform operators, and other partners, for facilitating trading and for market data information, and potential impacts from changes in their business models and priorities; volatility in commodity, equity and fixed income prices, and price volatility of financial benchmarks and instruments such as interest rates, equity indices, fixed income instruments&nbsp;</i><i>and foreign exchange rates; economic, social, political and market conditions, including the volatility of the capital&nbsp;</i><i>and credit markets and the impact of economic conditions on the trading activity of our current and potential customers; our ability to accommodate increases in contract volume and market data and order transaction traffic across the entire trade cycle and the ability to implement enhancements without failure or degradation of the</i>&nbsp;<i>performance of our trading and clearing systems and meeting our regulatory reporting obligations; our ability to execute our growth strategy and maintain our growth effectively; our ability to manage the risks, control the costs and achieve the synergies associated with our strategy for acquisitions, investments and alliances, including those associated with the performance of our joint ventures with S&amp;P Dow Jones (S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LL) in index services, our primary business and distribution partners' actions and our partnership with&nbsp;Google, including our ability to manage the successful implementation of our agreements with&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Cloud and our data center partners; variances in earnings on cash accounts and collateral that our clearing house holds for its clients; impact of&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;pricing/fee level and structure and incentive changes; impact of aggregation services and internalization on trade flow and volumes; any negative financial impacts from changes to the terms of intellectual property and index rights; our ability to continue to generate funds and/or manage our indebtedness to allow us to continue to invest in our business; industry, channel partner and customer consolidation and/or concentration; decreases in trading and clearing activity; the imposition of a transaction tax or user fee on futures and options transactions and/or repeal of the 60/40 tax treatment of such transactions; increases in effective tax rates, borrowing costs, or changes in tax policy; our ability to maintain our brand and reputation; and the unfavorable resolution of material legal proceedings. For a detailed discussion and additional information concerning these and other factors that might affect our performance, see our other recent periodic filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended&nbsp;December 31, 2023&nbsp;as filed with the&nbsp;Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;("SEC") on&nbsp;February 28, 2024, under the caption "Risk Factors."</i></p>

<title>FIA Tech’s Trade Data Network Now Supports Real Time T+0 Fees And Commissions Matching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FIA Tech, a leading technology provider in the futures industry, today announced that its Trade Data Network is now live with real time fee and commission matching, reconciliation and resolution, allowing the buyside complete transparency into one of the biggest sources of operational frustration for the exchange traded derivatives industry.</p>
<p>This marks the go-live of the second phase of FIA Tech&rsquo;s initiative to improve fees and commission related operational issues for the buyside, following the launch of FIA Tech&rsquo;s Fee and Commission Repository which brought the central storage of golden source information on exchange and clearing fees, commissions and regulatory fees.</p>
<p>Fee and Commission breaks are by far the largest source of matching breaks in the ETD market and including them in TDN&rsquo;s matching capabilities gives clients the ability to match in real time, depending on the capabilities of their brokers. Currently, managing these breaks takes up the bulk of ETD operations teams&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Nick Solinger, President and CEO of FIA Tech, said: &ldquo;93% of buyside firms in our recent industry survey stated T+0 processing gaps are driving significant operational costs and risks.&nbsp; It remains far too challenging for the ETD industry to manage the complexity of exchange fees, commissions, brokerage and regulatory fees across 80+ global exchanges. TDN is the first post-trade solution bringing all the golden source data on Brokerage, Fees and Commissions together in real-time from all participants - the clients, clearing firms, brokers and exchanges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ETD market has long struggled with a lack of transparency and high volumes of varied and inconsistent data, with multiple sources, formats, timings, and standards. This hampers the accurate exchange of data and requires manual processes and duplicative reconciliations, making communication between participants slow and costly. TDN was created to integrate disparate post-trade ETD data in real time from multiple sources, including executing brokers, CCPs, clearing brokers and clients, and offer matching services to create a single trade lineage in a common, secure, standards-based ledger.</p>
<p>Funded by the market, TDN is already supported by over 20 banks/brokers and 40 investment managers/hedge funds with a total AUM of $34 trillion. It has a comprehensive coverage of all exchanges and CCPs, with support of clearing and executing firms representing over 80% of the global futures volumes. TDN is one of the only global trade ledger initiatives to gain widespread adoption and production deployment at scale, processing millions of transactions in real time each day.</p>

<title>SIX Launches New Service To Transform Crypto Collateral Management</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-service-to-transform-crypto-collateral-management-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-service-to-transform-crypto-collateral-management-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX launched the new Digital Collateral Service (DCS) today, permitting financial institutions to post selected cryptocurrency assets as collateral alongside traditional collateral.</span></p>
<p>The new product offers a solution through which clients can manage traditional securities and cryptocurrency collateral. Firms managing both bonds and bitcoin, for example, can now post both as collateral to cover a single exposure. This will simplify operations for traders and their counterparts significantly, enhancing portfolio management efficiency and minimizing counterparty risk. SIX has developed this service by combining and leveraging expertise from different areas in its international custody business and SDX.</p>
<p>Beyond providing a more seamless and holistic collateral management platform, DCS leverages the crypto custody infrastructure of SDX, delivering users enhanced safeguarding mechanisms. The default protection for collateral held in this type of account structure adds a layer of security that many institutional investors have been seeking to justify greater participation in institutional cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the new offering,&nbsp;<span>David Newns, Head SDX</span>, said: &ldquo;The role of cryptocurrencies in collateral management will become increasingly important. Our new and fully integrated solution empowers product issuers, traders, brokers, and market makers to optimize their collateral usage, whether it&rsquo;s crypto or traditional securities, with built-in risk management safeguards. This allows financial institutions to embrace crypto collateral on a larger scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Christian Geiger, Head Clients &amp; Products Securities Finance, SIX</span>, added: &ldquo;Building on our role as a trusted financial market infrastructure and leveraging the flexibility of our state-of-the-art Triparty Agent, we are thrilled to expand our offerings to include cryptocurrencies as a new asset class for collateralization. With the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, we are committed to meeting the needs of this highly risk-conscious investor segment through our established and reliable services.&rdquo;</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="prof-standards"></a>Professional standards and assessment of qualifications</h2>
<p>Since 1 January 2019, certain&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/" title="Professional standards for financial advisers">professional standards</a>&nbsp;have applied to relevant providers (i.e. advisers who are authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products) and to provisional relevant providers (i.e. individuals in the third or fourth quarter of their professional year).</p>
<p>Among other things, relevant providers and provisional relevant providers must comply with the &lsquo;qualifications standard&rsquo; in section 921B(2) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001&nbsp;</em>(Corporations Act). Relevant providers who are existing providers have until 1 January 2026 to meet the qualifications standard.</p>
<p>In response to feedback from industry, ASIC has developed additional guidance for assessing an individual&rsquo;s qualifications and training against the qualifications standard.</p>
<p>We created worked examples to show how an AFS licensee should assess and input the qualifications of their relevant providers into the financial advisers register: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/#examples" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Example qualification assessments</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website.</p>
<p>The webinar hosted by ASIC in November 2024 also provides a practical walkthrough of how to assess a person&rsquo;s qualifications against the requirements, and how to input qualifications information into the financial advisers register. See&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/asic-webinar-on-assessing-relevant-provider-qualifications/" title="ASIC webinar on assessing relevant provider qualifications">ASIC webinar on assessing relevant provider qualifications</a>&nbsp;for a recording, slides and consolidated list of answers to questions asked during the webinar.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="exp-prov"></a>Experienced provider pathway</h2>
<p>Financial advisers must meet&nbsp;<strong>both</strong>&nbsp;of the following criteria to be eligible to rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard in section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act and the professional year standard in section 921B(4) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>First, they must meet the definition of &lsquo;experienced provider&rsquo; in section 1684 of the Corporations Act. Specifically, they must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>been a relevant provider for at least 10 years (that is, 3,650 days &ndash; whether consecutive or not) during the period 1&nbsp;January 2007 to 31&nbsp;December 2021, and</li>
<li>had a clean disciplinary record as at 31 December 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, if they are an existing provider and did not pass the financial adviser exam by the exam cut-off day that applies to them (1&nbsp;January 2022, or 1&nbsp;October 2022 if they qualified for the exam extension), their authorisation to provide personal advice must have ceased before their exam cut-off day. That is, they must not have been authorised to provide personal advice on their exam cut-off day.</p>
<p>Financial advisers who meet both of the above criteria and wish to rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard and the professional year standard must make a written declaration confirming that they satisfy the definition of &lsquo;experienced provider&rsquo;. They must then give a copy of their declaration to their authorising AFS licensee(s) as soon as practicable after making the declaration. If the financial adviser is eligible to access the pathway, the AFS licensee(s) must notify ASIC that the licensee has received a copy of a written declaration within 30 business days after the day the declaration was given to them.</p>
<p>To meet the 10 years experience requirement, a financial adviser must demonstrate that they were authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients on relevant financial products for at least 10 years during the relevant period. Other authorisations (for example, an authorisation covering general advice only) do not count towards the 10 years experience requirement.</p>
<p>Existing providers who plan to rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard should make a written declaration before&nbsp;<strong>1&nbsp;January 2026</strong>&nbsp;so that they can continue to be authorised and registered to provide personal advice from this date.</p>
<p>For more information on the experienced provider pathway, see Information Sheet 281&nbsp;<em>FAQs: Relevant providers &ndash; Accessing the experienced provider pathway&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/faqs-relevant-providers-accessing-the-experienced-provider-pathway/">INFO 281</a>).</p>
<h2><a id="review-comp"></a>Review of compliance with professional standards and professional year programs</h2>
<p>ASIC recently reviewed a sample of records retained by AFS licensees in relation to their assessment of the professional standards for financial advisers. We also reviewed a sample of AFS licensee professional year programs.</p>

<h2><a id="first-internal"></a>First internal dispute resolution data report and findings</h2>
<p>In December 2024, ASIC released Report 801&nbsp;<em>Insights from internal dispute resolution data reporting: July 2023 to June 2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-801-insights-from-internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting-july-2023-to-june-2024/" title="REP 801 Insights from internal dispute resolution data reporting: July 2023 to June 2024">REP 801</a>) &ndash; the first publication of industry-wide data under the internal dispute resolution (IDR) data reporting framework: see also Media Release (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-264mr-asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/" title="24-264MR ASIC flags key observations from inaugural IDR data publication">24-264MR</a>)&nbsp;<em>ASIC flags key observations from inaugural IDR data publication</em>&nbsp;(3 December 2024).</p>
<p>Under the framework, most licensed financial firms are required to report IDR data to ASIC on a 6-monthly basis. Publishing IDR data promotes transparency by sharing valuable information with consumers, while also helping to drive improvements in IDR practices.</p>
<p>While we do not verify that financial firms&rsquo; self-reported data accurately reflects their underlying complaints handling, we found variations in the volume of complaints reported by comparable firms as well as gaps in the IDR data. This indicates the data reported to ASIC may not fully reflect the complaints received by some firms. As a result, we are concerned that some firms are not reporting IDR data as accurately as is possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, 5,035 firms declared no complaints to report for the full year. This number is higher than we expected.</p>
<p>We will assess compliance with the reporting requirements, such as by reviewing firms that make a nil submission against other datasets, including reports of misconduct, reportable situations and data from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. While there may be reasonable explanations for some of these variances, we encourage firms to carefully review our report and guidance to assist in reporting complete and accurate IDR data.</p>
<p>This year we will start publishing data about complaints received by individual firms. It is crucial that firms act now to address any gaps in IDR reporting processes, because we will publish the data as it is reported to us.</p>
<p>More information about IDR reporting obligations is available on ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting/" title="Internal dispute resolution data reporting">IDR data reporting page</a>&nbsp;(which includes frequently asked questions) and in Regulatory Guide 271&nbsp;<em>Internal dispute resolution&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-271-internal-dispute-resolution/" title="RG 271 Internal dispute resolution">RG 271</a>).</p>
<h2><a id="first-report"></a>First report on the adoption of artificial intelligence by licensees</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the provision of financial services and credit in Australia. It provides opportunities for more efficient, accessible and tailored products and services. However, AI can also amplify existing risks to consumers and introduce new ones. Potential harms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>bias and discrimination</li>
<li>provision of false information</li>
<li>exploitation of consumer vulnerabilities and behavioural biases, and</li>
<li>erosion of consumer trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shape our understanding of risk to consumers and inform our regulatory response, we reviewed the use of AI by 23 AFS and credit licensees and published our findings in Report 798&nbsp;<em>Beware the gap:&nbsp;Governance arrangements in the face of AI innovation</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-798-beware-the-gap-governance-arrangements-in-the-face-of-ai-innovation/" title="REP 798 Beware the gap: Governance arrangements in the face of AI innovation">REP 798</a>).</p>
<p>The report noted a rapid acceleration in the volume of AI use cases and a shift towards more complex and opaque types of AI such as generative AI. The licensees also told us they are planning to increase their use of AI.</p>
<p>We are concerned that not all licensees are well-positioned to manage the challenges of their expanding AI use. Changes in governance and risk management arrangements are slow; it is therefore likely that any gap between AI use and AI governance arrangements will widen as AI adoption increases. This could leave licensees unprepared to respond quickly but safely to innovations from competitors.</p>
<p>ASIC is urging financial services licensees to ensure their governance practices keep pace with their accelerating adoption of AI.</p>

<h2><a id="update-fscp"></a>Update from the Financial Services and Credit Panel</h2>
<p>The Financial Services and Credit Panel (FSCP) makes disciplinary decisions in relation to financial advisers. The FSCP has been in operation for 2 years. The FSCP is a pool of industry participants, appointed by the responsible Minister, that ASIC draws on when forming individual sitting panels.</p>
<p>The FSCP operates alongside but independent of ASIC&rsquo;s existing administrative decision-making processes. A sitting panel will be convened by ASIC to consider certain instances of suspected misconduct by, or circumstances relating to, a financial adviser. Each sitting panel comprises an ASIC staff member and at least two members of the FSCP. For further information on the functions and operation of the FSCP, see Regulatory Guide 263&nbsp;<em>Financial Services and Credit Panel</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-263-financial-services-and-credit-panel/" title="RG 263 Financial Services and Credit Panel">RG 263</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC maintains the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/financial-services-and-credit-panel-fscp/fscp-outcomes-register/" title="FSCP Outcomes Register">FSCP Outcomes Register</a>&nbsp;which contains decisions of the FSCP and a brief explanation of the background to the decisions. Some recent outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A written supervision direction to audit the next 10 pieces of advice by an independent person at the relevant provider&rsquo;s cost</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The sitting panel found that the relevant provider contravened sections 961B(1), 961G and 921E of the Corporations Act. They gave advice in June 2023 recommending a client roll over $2 million from an untaxed state superannuation scheme. When giving the advice, the relevant provider failed to take into account or disclose that the $2 million exceeded the untaxed cap rollover limit of $1.65 million, that the client had also previously used a portion of this limit, and that tax would be payable at a rate of 47% on amounts exceeding the cap. As a result of accepting the advice, the client paid $201,365 in tax for exceeding the cap.</li>
<li><strong>A reprimand issued to a relevant provider for contraventions of sections 961B(1), 961G and 921E(3) of the Corporations Act&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The relevant provider recommended a client make a non-concessional superannuation contribution of $329,000 in the 2022&ndash;23 financial year when the client&rsquo;s non-concessional cap for that year was $220,000. When giving the advice, the relevant provider failed to obtain or take into account superannuation assets in the client&rsquo;s public sector superannuation fund. As a result, the client needed to withdraw $120,735 from their superannuation and pay tax of $13,570 on the associated earning.</li>
<li><strong>A warning issued to a relevant provider for contravention of section 946A(1) of the Corporations Act&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The relevant provider was found to have failed to give a Statement of Advice to a client. Between February 2022 and November 2022, the relevant provider gave Records of Advice to clients, relying on Statements of Advice that had been given to the clients by a different providing entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="review-advice"></a>Review of advice on establishing a self-managed super fund</h2>
<p>In ASIC&rsquo;s Corporate Plan 2024&ndash;25, we announced that we will conduct a surveillance of personal advice provided to retail clients about establishing SMSFs. This will involve a thematic review across numerous AFS licensees and advisers. We will focus on why some consumers are advised to set up an SMSF, even though an SMSF may not be suitable for them and may adversely affect their retirement outcomes.</p>
<p>The project follows a thematic SMSF advice review which led to the release of Report 575<em>&nbsp;SMSFs: Improving the quality of advice and member experiences&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-575-smsfs-improving-the-quality-of-advice-and-member-experiences/" title="REP 575 SMSFs: Improving the quality of advice and member experiences">REP 575</a>) in June 2018 and Information Sheet 274<em>&nbsp;Tips for giving self-managed superannuation fund advice</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/tips-for-giving-self-managed-superannuation-fund-advice/" title="Tips for giving self-managed superannuation fund advice">INFO 274</a>) in December 2022.</p>
<p>The two main streams of work are underway concurrently and involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reviewing client advice files where SMSF establishment advice has been provided &ndash; ASIC will assess compliance with the best interest duty and related obligations, and</li>
<li>observing the role of AFS licensees in monitoring and supervising their representatives who are providing SMSF establishment advice &ndash; this includes considering information obtained from licensees about their oversight and the application of their policies and procedures in the context of providing SMSF establishment advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our approach of considering licensees&rsquo; roles and reviewing advice files is similar to our approach for Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>), released in February 2024.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of our project, we expect to release public messages about our findings. Where appropriate, we will take enforcement or other regulatory action against misconduct.</p>
<h2><a id="reportable"></a>Reportable situations regime update</h2>
<p>The reportable situations regime (formerly breach reporting) is a cornerstone of the financial services and credit regulatory regimes. The regime acknowledges that, despite an expectation of compliance, breaches will occur, and AFS licensees then have an obligation to report these to ASIC.</p>
<p>Licensees have a clear role in lifting industry standards as a whole, and part of this role is timely identification of their own breaches. The requirement to report to ASIC also encourages licensees to rectify and remediate issues in a timely manner, and the reports we receive are a critical source of regulatory intelligence for ASIC.</p>
<p>Report 800&nbsp;<em>Insights from the reportable situations regime: July 2023 to June 2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-800-insights-from-the-reportable-situations-regime-july-2023-to-june-2024/" title="REP 800 Insights from the reportable situations regime: July 2023 to June 2024">REP 800</a>) is ASIC&rsquo;s third publication of the information we have received under the reportable situations regime. It provides high-level insights into the trends observed in reports lodged by licensees under the regime between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024.</p>
<p>We have also published information on how licensees can improve their compliance through finding, fixing and reporting breaches in our news item,&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/reportable-situations-findings-of-asic-s-review-and-how-licensees-can-improve-compliance-with-the-regime/" title="Reportable situations: Findings of ASIC&rsquo;s review and how licensees can improve compliance with the regime">Reportable situations: Findings of ASIC&rsquo;s review and how licensees can improve compliance with the regime</a>&nbsp;(4 December 2024).</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Provides Clarity To e-money/payment Services Providers On Licensing Requirements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-provides-clarity-to-e-moneypayment-serv-2025212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-provides-clarity-to-e-moneypayment-serv-2025212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FMA is pleased to clarify the licensing requirements for e-money and payment service providers. In short, there is no specific licence for e-money institutions or payments service providers in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Instead, providers will have a range of obligations under New Zealand&rsquo;s financial services regulatory regime, either through the Financial Markets Conduct Act, or the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act. The level of regulation will largely depend on whether providers are issuing debt securities as part of their service offering. This would be the case if, in connection with the e-money or payments service, providers accept customer deposits or other repayable funds (other than on trust). &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the FMA&rsquo;s purposes is promote innovation and flexibility while also ensuring consumers understand what they are buying. Through recent conversations with industry, we heard from providers who wanted greater clarity from the FMA on the requirements.</p>
<p>E-money and payment service providers offer services such as storing and managing electronic money (e-wallets), virtual currencies and currency conversions. It&rsquo;s a service that has the potential to offer genuine competition to the non-banking sector and one we believe should be embraced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you seek independent legal advice if you think this may apply to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can read more about what the requirements are if you are issuing debt securities as part of your service offering, as well as the FMA&rsquo;s expectations here.</p>

<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, today was named to the Chartis RiskTech&reg; Energy50 ranking of the world&rsquo;s major players in energy and risk technology. Ranked at #14 in its first appearance on the list, TT also won the award for Trade Surveillance: Energy Exchange Traded Markets.</p>
<p>Every year, the Energy50 assesses the top 50 energy technology vendors, focusing on their ability to innovate in risk trading analytics, compliance and operational efficiency. The detailed analysis considers factors such as firms&rsquo; market influence, technological advances and strategic direction, to provide &ldquo;a complete view of the ways in which these market leaders are driving transformation in the sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alun Green, TT&rsquo;s EVP Managing Director, Futures &amp; Options, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored that Chartis, which is quite thorough in its research, has identified TT as driving transformation in the energy sector and contributing to the success of institutions operating in the energy markets and other asset classes. One recent enhancement that builds on our presence in energy is launching access to the two leading intraday power markets in Europe, providing side-by-side trading opportunities in the financial and physical markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jay Biondo, Head of Surveillance at TT, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve put significant resources into strengthening our TT Trade Surveillance offering and ensuring that it provides a comprehensive compliance solution &ndash; now across a range of asset classes. Clients can leverage dozens of configurable models to identify and address a full range of behaviors and our new, patent-pending cross-instrument models that detect patterns of spoofing behavior across markets, exchanges and products, utilizing our AI-driven machine learning-based spoofing models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In December, Trading Technologies earned the number 12 spot in the Chartis Buyside Platforms 2024 ranking of the top 50 providers of buy-side platforms and technology. Chartis also gave TT &ldquo;strong category leader&rdquo; status for both energy and equity trade surveillance solutions in its December Market Quadrants report, providing a detailed evaluation of key providers offering advanced surveillance solutions unique to these markets. In October, Chartis recognized TT as one of the world&rsquo;s top risk and compliance technology providers in its RiskTech100&reg; 2025 rankings, highlighting the company as the fourth best new entrant among the 22 firms that debuted in this year&rsquo;s rankings.</p>

<title>The EBA Amends Its Guidelines On ICT And Security Risk Management Measures In The Context Of DORA Application</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) narrowed down the scope of its existing Guidelines on ICT and security risk management measures, due to the application of harmonised ICT risk management requirements under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) from 17 January 2025. &nbsp;These amendments aim at simplifying the ICT risk management framework and providing legal clarity to the market.</span></p>
<p>DORA has introduced harmonised requirements on ICT risk management that apply to financial entities across the banking, securities/markets, insurance and pensions sectors.</p>
<p>To avoid duplication of requirements and to provide legal clarity to the market, the EBA has amended its Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. In particular, the EBA has narrowed down:</p>
<ul>
<li>the entity scope of the Guidelines to only those that are covered by DORA, namely credit institutions, payment institutions, account information service providers, exempted payment institutions and exempted e-money institutions; and</li>
<li>the scope of the Guidelines to the requirements on relationship management of the payment service users in relation to the provision of payment services.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that security and operational risk management requirements under the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which are applicable since March 2018, continue to apply to other types of payment service providers (PSPs), such as post-office giro institutions and credit unions, that are not covered by DORA. PSPs that are still subject to security and operational risk management under the PSD2 can potentially be subject to additional national requirements, regardless of the existence of the EBA Guidelines that would apply to them. Competent authorities or Member States&rsquo; governments wishing to retain the approach set out in the EBA Guidelines for those PSPs can continue to do so under their national legal framework or supervisory measures.</p>
<h4>Background, legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>On 27 November 2019, the&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk84240753">EBA published the&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2020/GLs%20on%20ICT%20and%20security%20risk%20management/872936/Final%20draft%20Guidelines%20on%20ICT%20and%20security%20risk%20management.pdf">Guidelines on ICT and security risk management</a>&nbsp;(EBA/GL/2019/04)&nbsp;(&ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo;) which were built on the provisions of Article&nbsp;74 of&nbsp;Directive&nbsp;2013/36/EU (CRD)<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-amends-its-guidelines-ict-and-security-risk-management-measures-context-dora-application#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;and Article&nbsp;95(3) of Directive (EU)&nbsp;2015/2366 (PSD2)<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-amends-its-guidelines-ict-and-security-risk-management-measures-context-dora-application#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;. These Guidelines established requirements for credit institutions, investment firms and PSPs on the mitigation and management of their ICT and security risks and aim to ensure a consistent and robust approach across the Single market. The Guidelines entered into force in 2020 and replaced and repealed the preceding Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks that the EBA had issued three years earlier in fulfilment of a mandate under PSD2 (EBA GL/2017/17).</p>
<p>From 17 January 2025, DORA applies and introduces, inter alia, harmonised requirements for ICT risk management framework (RMF), incident reporting, and third-party risk management and testing.</p>
<p>The amended Guidelines will apply within two months of the publication of the translated versions.</p>

<p>Overview of the results:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>The Group's net revenue increased by a total of 15 per cent to &euro;5,829 million in 2024; organic growth amounted to 8 per cent.</li>
<li>EBITDA of &euro;3,396 million saw an increase of 15 per cent.</li>
<li>The Group has therefore significantly exceeded its original guidance for the full year.</li>
<li>For the dividend, the Executive Board is proposing an increase to &euro;4.00 per share.</li>
<li>In addition, the Group announces a new share buyback program with a volume of &euro;500 million.</li>
<li>For 2025, the Group expects further organic growth and net revenue without treasury result of around &euro;5.2 billion and EBITDA without treasury result of around &euro;2.7 billion.</li>
<li>Stephan Leithner, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG, comments on the results as follows: &ldquo;In 2024, we once again significantly increased our net revenue. We have benefited from strong organic growth across the entire Group - even excluding interest income. Our great commodities business, the strong core business of Securities Services and the very good performance of Software Solutions were the main revenue drivers. Through effective management, we minimized organic cost growth and once again achieved a disproportionate increase in profits. We let our shareholders participate in this positive development by increasing the total distribution including share buybacks to a record level of more than &euro;1.2 billion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Commenting on the outlook, Stephan Leithner says: &ldquo;We are well on track to achieve our strategic and financial targets for 2026.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I am going to spend most of the time today setting out the scale and significance of changes in financial market activity in recent years, and what this means for financial stability. My main message is that the significance of these changes has not been fully taken on board in many assessments of the challenges facing financial stability and the tools we need to assess the risks the changes have created. I will also put these issues into some broader context, around the role of central banks and of regulation.</p>
<p>An important theme here is that of moving to a financial system in which the presence and impact of non-banks and market-based finance is much larger. In this context, I will set out the importance of two recent Bank of England innovations which are I think pioneering in the central banking world: these are our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/boe-system-wide-exploratory-scenario-exercise/boe-swes-exercise-final-report">System Wide Exploratory Scenario</a>, a new form of stress test tool, and the introduction of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/january/contingent-nbfi-repo-facility-market-notice-28-january-2025">new contingent liquidity facility</a>&nbsp;for some non-banks. There is another important area of focus involving non-bank finance, namely the growth of private credit. That is not my focus today.</p>
<p>Let me start with the broader context. Four points stand out.</p>
<p>First, we have learned from long experience that central banks have two core purposes, monetary and financial stability, and that while policies in respect of each need to be focused and thus separate, they are dependent on one another to a very high degree. Specifically, for much of the existence of central banks, financial stability has not had the prominence or institutional development that has occurred with monetary policy. Even today, it can at times feel as if it is living in the shadow. Some central banks, like the<br />Bank of England, have gone further and operate with an institutional structure that ensures equal ranking across the two core purposes, but that is by no means universal.</p>
<p>Second, central banking is inherently a counter-cyclical activity. It took time for this to become monetary orthodoxy in the nineteenth century, and even more time for it to become explicitly part of the macroprudential approach to financial stability after the experience of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) over 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Third, central banking policy making has to incorporate a substantial global context. Ultimately, the policies are national ones, but they have to reflect and incorporate global risks and events. This has been the case since at least the 1870s, which saw probably the first globally synchronised financial crisis. Global standards are an anchor for national standards. Set right, they facilitate openness and economic growth.</p>
<p>Fourth, one of the orthodoxies of central banking is that we act as the ultimate providers of liquidity to our banking system. In doing so, we seek to achieve our critical outcomes, namely: implementing the chosen official interest rate as the means to anchor monetary policy and achieve low inflation and price stability; achieving financial stability via the provision of high quality liquidity in the form of so-called central bank money; and third, achieving and preserving the singleness of money, so that all forms of money have an assured equal nominal value (the pound in my bank is worth the same as the pound in your bank, and will remain so).</p>
<p>It has over time become central bank canon law that we transact with banks. In other words, the banking system has a special place, as the conduit for the transmission of central bank policies. This is the central bank equivalent of the old Heineken advert, &ldquo;Refreshes the Parts Other Beers Cannot Reach&rdquo;. The key point here is the assumption that in all states of the world &ndash; non-stressed and stressed &ndash; central bank liquidity supplied through the banks would reach those parts of the financial system and economy in need.</p>
<p>Moreover, you don&rsquo;t have to go far back in time, certainly not to the start of my career forty years ago, to find that the Bank of England&rsquo;s interface was with a small number of banks &ndash; though admittedly they represented a large share of the system (and in saying that I am deliberately overlooking the role of discount houses &ndash; a rather unique British feature). During the operation of these arrangements, there were times when strains in terms of the efficiency of the liquidity flow were evident, but for a long time this system held together.</p>
<p>However, over time the issue of whether financial stability policies which are aimed at the banking system can be relied upon to ensure stability across the whole financial system has come increasingly to the forefront. In this sense, the issue is not new. This year marks forty years since I joined the Bank of England. One of the first things I worked on after joining in 1985 was to have a very small role in a BIS study called Recent Innovations in International Banking, chaired by Sam Cross of the New York Fed. In thinking about my remarks today, I went back to that report &ndash; after a long break &ndash; and particularly the conclusions it drew on so-called macro-prudential policy, and the role of the non-bank financial system. It&rsquo;s worth drawing out again five points made in the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the highest quality borrowers increasingly turning to direct credit markets, the average quality of banks&rsquo; loan assets may gradually decline by comparison;</li>
<li>In view of its narrower base, the international banking system might become less responsive to sudden liquidity needs or other shocks in the corporate or other borrowing sectors;</li>
<li>A greater share of credit is likely to flow through capital market channels, which may be characterised by less supervision, but less complete information on which to base credit decisions, and by more distant business relationships between debtor and creditor, perhaps complicating the task of arranging rescheduling or financing packages for those with debt servicing problems;</li>
<li>Both banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) are relying more on income from off-balance sheet business; and</li>
<li>The distinction between banks and other financial institutions is becoming progressively blurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds familiar? Bear in mind, this was written 20 years before the GFC. As a spoiler for what&rsquo;s to come, I asked myself the question, what did the report miss that we now know? Two things stand out I think: the growth of leverage in the non-bank sector; and the growth of markets in sovereign tradeable debt &ndash; the report was focused much more on corporate debt.</p>
<p>So, what happened after that report was published? The regulatory world focused more on regulating financial stability through regulating the banking system. This was the emerging world of the Basel Agreements. The GFC rocked that world.</p>
<p>Out of that experience came several things: more Basel, in terms of microprudential regulation; mandatory clearing and placing clearing houses at the centre of the system to enhance resilience; a much enhanced focus on global macro financial stability, with the Financial Stability Board to the forefront; and a recognition that there needs to be a more explicit role for macroprudential policy.</p>
<p>What also came out of the GFC and post-GFC policies was a further shift in the balance of financial intermediation from the banking to the non-banking system, with the non-bank sector now making up nearly 50% of global financial assets compared to 40% for the banking sector. And so for the last fifteen years we have increasingly seen the emergence of risks to financial stability originating in the non-bank system.</p>
<p>This is the backdrop to the next section of my remarks today, which seeks to draw out just how much the system has changed in the last few years.</p>
<p>The key theme here is how much activity and risk in core financial markets now largely resides outside the banking system. This is not a new theme, given the post GFC changes, and it was the correct response to the dangers realised in the GFC of inappropriate risk inside the banking system. Our assessment is that the pace and scale of change in this direction continues to gather momentum. The footprint of hedge funds and non-bank market makers has grown substantially in recent years. Alongside this, what I will &ndash; without in any sense wishing to be disparaging &ndash; call the more traditional asset management industry has refocused towards passive investment strategies. Meanwhile, the role of banks has shifted towards providing risk warehousing and financing to markets and NBFIs. These are fundamental changes in the dynamics of markets.</p>
<p>Three non-bank business models stand out as dominant players in this rapidly evolving landscape.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ve seen the rise of multi-manager hedge funds in which individual portfolio managers &ndash; or &ldquo;pods&rdquo; &ndash; trade independently from one another under the banner of a single fund. These funds are large, sophisticated and manage risk centrally to ensure sufficient diversification. Their diversification means that they can benefit from a high degree of leverage from banks. They&rsquo;ve also benefitted from an influx of talent from banks. There are benefits of this type of fund structure. It is a world where more and more portfolio managers operate under sophisticated umbrella risk management which can lean against large fund-level concentrations. However, there could be circumstances in which the means by which multi-manager funds protect themselves in this respect can create risks to the system. Specifically, where risk management results in pods de-risking aggressively in a shock, this could result in these funds amplifying market moves.</p>
<p>Second, systematic strategies which trade based on complex statistical models and rules and market signals rather than fundamentals are becoming more popular. These strategies were at one time the preserve of the FX and equity markets but are now becoming more prevalent in the fixed income world enabled by technological innovation. Their presence has increased the speed at which markets react as well as the number of instances of technical-driven corrections that are difficult to explain based on the fundamental outlook. They too obtain a high degree of leverage from banks.</p>
<p>Third, non-bank market makers, notably high frequency and principal trading firms, have grown substantially in scale and scope globally. They previously undertook intra-day market activity but are now moving into carrying risk for longer periods of time. Market liquidity in normal times appears to have improved because of their presence. To illustrate this, throughout the substantial movements in bond yields during recent months we have not seen stress in terms of market functioning. The evidence of whether these entities help or hinder market liquidity in stress is more mixed.</p>
<p>Whilst the growing scale of these non-bank exposures has been absorbed by banks acting as prime brokers so far, such trends, if they continue, could have a profound effect on banks &lsquo; balance sheet capacity in the future.&nbsp; As fund leverage increases and risk asset prices rise inexorably over time, there comes a point at which an inevitable strain is placed upon the system.&nbsp; An excess of demand for financing resources over their supply could lead to repricing, tempting existing players to overreach and take on more risk than they should. Conversely, new entrants which are ill equipped to scale up quickly could be exposed to risks that could be highly damaging.</p>
<p>In sum, the market looks very different to what it was only five years ago. It involves large shifts in leverage, pricing power, speed of trading and liquidity provision. To be clear, these changes are not inherently bad, but they could create a new set of financial stability vulnerabilities which we need to understand and monitor and adapt new tools and approaches where appropriate.</p>
<p>Among these potential vulnerabilities, I would highlight a number:</p>
<ul>
<li>An increased likelihood and severity of procyclical jumps to illiquidity and large market moves that are unexplained by fundamentals. Multi-manager funds can make individual &ldquo;pods&rdquo; deleverage rapidly in stress conditions, which can exaggerate market moves. Smaller funds are more exposed to banks withdrawing financing. Systematic funds can deleverage automatically in response to a change in price signals. And,<br />non-bank market makers, while active in normal times may withdraw liquidity in a stress;</li>
<li>Second, there is a tendency towards increased concentration and interconnectedness given that these large hedge funds and market makers operate across all significant financial markets and represent the bulk of banks&rsquo; prime brokerage balance sheets;</li>
<li>Third, there is greater evidence of correlated activity. The funds are generally well capitalised and have longer gating periods than in the past, but both their trading and risk management strategies tend to be quite similar, increasing the prospect of common responses. While multi-managers are well placed to avoid correlations within each fund, correlation can still emerge across different funds as different multi-managers are often attracted to similar types of strategies; and</li>
<li>Fourth, opacity and limited visibility in certain markets tends to lead to crowded trades, impairs risk management, and is more likely to prompt a rush to the exit in times of stress. We have seen evidence of this in a number of market events in recent years. An example is the Archegos incident where the limited visibility of the overall position made it hard for any single participant to manage and scale their exposure and in my assessment made the eventual problem when it materialised more of a threat to market stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to use the rest of my time to answer the question, what do we do about the risks and vulnerabilities that can arise from this change of market structure? To be clear, the answer is not to seek to stand in the way of change. That&rsquo;s not sensible. There are good reasons why these changes are happening. Many of the trends being seen can support smoother and more efficient market dynamics and pricing in normal times, as well as increased and improved liquidity. They also provide an opportunity to diversify finance and lending to the real economy and if undertaken in a sustainable way then these developments can play a role in supporting growth.</p>
<p>There are good reasons why moving activity out of the banking system has happened. There are areas of risk taking that are not suited to being directly backed by deposits, and thus putting those deposits at risk. That was a lesson of the financial crisis. They are better being directly backed by what I would describe as investment capital. But a key point here is that it needs to be very clear to the providers that the investment capital is at risk, and that this is what goes with the returns. Mostly this understanding is in place, but sometimes it turns out not to be.</p>
<p>But if that takes care of the direct risk, we are still left with a substantial financial stability vulnerability arising from the more indirect risks, those that are less well understood, and can often put the system more broadly into difficulty. This is classic modern financial stability risk. The banking system may not be directly exposed to these risks, but in my experience there is a limited understanding of indirect risks which can arise at times of stress. And we seem to be more reliant on market-making and market liquidity provision from firms which are not so directly wired into the more assured forms of backstop liquidity, including from central banks. Likewise, the transparency of margining practices to increase predictability and thus liquidity management for NBFIs has become a focus of international work.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a pitch for the necessity and inevitabilities of more regulation. We are now in a world where attitudes towards regulation have changed, not I should say for the first time in my career. Hyman Minsky wisely pointed out that as memories of crises past recede, so attitudes towards regulation change. To paraphrase the historian Tony Judt, it is wise to avoid the idea that regulation is the best solution to any problem, but let&rsquo;s not fall into the opposite notion that it is by definition and always the worst available<br />option.&nbsp;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/andrew-bailey-keynote-speech-university-of-chicago-booth-school-of-business#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is important in today&rsquo;s setting that we have a fully informed debate about the role of regulation. That said, I want to emphasise three points. First, there is not a fundamental trade off between growth and financial stability. We must always assess the best choices to make in terms of the tools that we use, but the financial crisis demonstrated that there is no sustainable growth without financial stability. The issue of low potential growth and thus low actual growth that is with us today is not a creation of recent times; rather it goes back to the financial crisis, the serious recession that followed and the long-term loss of output. Second, we must not abandon or compromise our commitment to the surveillance of risks to financial stability &ndash; to pointing out the vulnerabilities and their potential consequences &ndash; the more so in view of the fundamental changes to the system I have just described. And, third, we must retain the ability to act on these risks, and always ensure that we have the ex-ante tools to deal with potential problems.</p>
<p>Surveillance enables us to be targeted in our regulatory approach, and focus on the most important financial stability risks and have the right tools to deal with the problems we identify.</p>
<p>On surveillance, we have undertaken a path-breaking new exercise at the Bank of England, our System-Wide Exploratory Scenario Exercise, or SWES (because we like acronyms). We conducted it with help from the Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. It is more of a flow type stress test than a traditional bank stress test. In other words, we explored injecting stress into the financial system and the consequences of its flowing through the system.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;SWES tested the resilience of markets that are core to the UK&rsquo;s economy by enhancing the understanding of the behaviours under stressed conditions of banks and NBFIs active in those markets. The primary objectives were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance understanding of the risks to and from NBFIs, and the behaviour of NBFIs and banks in stress, including what drives those behaviours; and</li>
<li>investigate how these behaviours and market dynamics can amplify shocks in markets and potentially pose risks to UK financial stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise was a first of its kind. It involved more than 50 market participants and covered a wide range of business models. It provided insights into the behaviour of different parts of the financial system under stress, and into the market dynamics and financial stability risks driven by their interactions. The SWES was not a test of the resilience of individual participants, but instead focused on system-wide resilience, with a focus on core UK financial markets.</p>
<p>The findings from the SWES provided insights into how, although rational individually, the behaviours of market participants could combine in ways that pose systemic risks. The exercise highlighted mismatches in firms' expectations of how others would act in a stress scenario. It also improved the understanding of risk management within the financial system and informed work to address vulnerabilities in market-based finance.</p>
<p>The SWES scenario comprised a rapid and significant shock to rates and credit spreads triggering significant losses and margin calls, with margin flowing from NBFIs to banks and central clearing parties (CCPs). The large and rapid market shock generated a significant liquidity need for many NBFIs in the form of margin calls and redemption requests. This liquidity impact combined with leverage and risk constraints, as well as investment strategies and other commercial drivers of behaviour, led to some NBFIs having to recapitalise and/or deleverage rapidly. Banks had limited appetite to take on additional risk in some core UK markets. Through derisking and deleveraging, the financial system acted to distribute and amplify the impact of the shock and some core UK markets came under pressure.</p>
<p>The SWES has provided us with important insights. In particular, I would highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding financial institutions&rsquo; behaviours and interactions:</strong>&nbsp;The exercise highlighted how the behaviours of different financial institutions can interact to amplify market shocks, for example how calls for additional capital from leveraged entities can result in automatic and correlated sales of securities. This understanding is crucial for developing policies that mitigate systemic risks.</li>
<li><strong>Mismatches in expectations of counterparties&rsquo; actions under stress, and risk management improvements:</strong>&nbsp;The SWES identified mismatches in firms' expectations of each other's actions during stress. For instance, users of cleared derivatives struggled accurately to estimate increases in initial margin due to the lack of transparency in CCP models, and users of repo markets overestimated their access to new repo funding under stress. This insight supports better risk management practices and helps firms prepare for potential market disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced surveillance and systemic risk assessment capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;The SWES provides a more comprehensive view of the financial system's dynamics under stress, which enhances our surveillance capabilities. This allows for more proactive identification and mitigation of systemic risks and the SWES report makes recommendations for UK markets.</li>
<li><strong>Insights into potential cross border spillovers:&nbsp;</strong>For example, we also saw that hedge funds are particularly sensitive to conditions in the US Treasury repo market. A sudden increase in haircuts or contraction in repo availability would have a significant impact on a number of hedge funds. Their response to a shift in repo financing conditions would not necessarily be contained to US Treasuries and could impact upon other markets.</li>
<li><strong>Policy development:</strong>&nbsp;The findings from the SWES are informing policy work to address vulnerabilities in market-based finance. This includes enhancing the resilience of core UK financial markets and improving the overall stability of the financial system. In many cases the exercise provides further evidence to support existing policy work and new areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SWES has demonstrated that such a system-wide approach is a valuable way to understand systemic risk in core markets.</p>
<p>We intend to invest in system-wide capabilities building on the SWES lessons learned. There are two main components to this. First, the SWES has allowed us to start to build modelling capability that could support lighter touch versions of SWES-type exercises for core UK markets in the future, supplemented with targeted engagement with financial firms to ensure behavioural assumptions remain appropriate. Second, we will consider whether to use SWES style exercises to explore risks in other markets over time. These exercises are particularly well suited to markets where interconnections and feedback are key, and where key firms are at the edge of the regulatory perimeter, where behavioural assumptions are critical, or where there are significant data gaps.</p>
<p>Moreover, for such an exercise to be most effective and targeted, prudential supervisors need to have a clear view of where risks are building within the system. Supervisors need to employ methods that are designed to identify and assess areas of potential vulnerability, using tools such as thematic reviews of emerging or growing risks, co-ordinated<br />multi-jurisdictional examinations of key global business lines (with home and host supervisors working together), and other techniques that enable effective peer comparison across banks.</p>
<p>I want to end back on the subject of liquidity provision in times of stress. I set out the canon law of central banking that liquidity goes through the banking system on the basis that the Heineken ad principle will apply in terms of the reach of these central bank lending facilities.</p>
<p>However, what we saw in the so-called Dash for Cash in early 2020 with the onset of Covid, and then the 2022 LDI episode were conditions in markets that demonstrated how vulnerabilities in NBFIs can propagate liquidity stress in core UK financial markets, notably the gilt market, and create a prospect of forced selling of gilts that could jeopardise financial stability.</p>
<p>NBFIs should manage the risks they face, and in some parts of the system it is appropriate that regulations are in place to provide more assurance of this management taking place. This is a key objective of the global Financial Stability Board. That said, it is not feasible or economic for NBFIs to maintain resilience to ensure self-insurance against the most extreme system-wide stresses, where the consequences may be forced selling and wider market disruption and a risk to financial stability. And, if the Heineken ad principle can&rsquo;t always be relied on in view of the changes in markets that I have described, in such circumstances central bank facilities should support financial stability by providing backstop liquidity to NBFIs and thus reduce the need to sell assets on a forced basis.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we have developed the Contingent NBFI Repo Facility, or CNRF, to tackle severe disruption in the gilt market that threatens financial stability due to shocks that increase the demand of NBFIs for liquidity.</p>
<p>The CNRF is a contingent facility to be activated at our discretion in view of the scale of the systemic stress in core markets and the ability of our traditional lending facilities for banks to mitigate that stress. It is not a standing facility. It will lend cash against gilt collateral to participating insurance companies, pension funds and liability-driven investment funds for a short term. The pricing will reflect the principle that it should be at a penalty rate.</p>
<p>This does widen the direct reach of our liquidity provision to eligible NBFIs that demonstrate an appropriate level of financial health. We think this is appropriate in view of changes to the financial system and the risks to financial stability from outside the banking system. But, it does not change a key central banking principle, namely that the standing provision of liquidity to support the so-called singleness of money goes only to the banks.</p>
<p>Both standing facilities and contingent facilities are available to banks because they create money and we need to ensure its singleness both in normal times and in times of severe market dysfunction and financial instability.&nbsp; There is no rationale for standing facilities for non-banks as they do not create money.&nbsp; There is only a rationale for a contingent facility because the evidence suggests that we need to adapt the Heineken principle only when there is a market dysfunction and on a temporary basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, it modifies and extends the Heineken ad approach, but does not change the principle that the scope and definition of money is limited to the central bank and commercial banks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my title today posed the question: &ldquo;Are we underestimating changes in financial markets?&rdquo; You may have decided by now that my answer to this question is yes. Moreover, the pace of change shows no signs of dropping off. As authorities responsible for ensuring financial stability, both domestically and globally, we have to keep our assessment and understanding up to speed. On this point, I want to thank all those, in the UK and overseas, who work with our teams at the Bank of England to inform our assessment and understanding. We couldn&rsquo;t do this without the time that you give to us.</p>
<p>Our assessment tools need to change, as do our tools of intervention. I have focused on two big changes that we have made.</p>
<p>The first is to introduce more dynamic &ndash; flow-style &ndash; market stress exercises alongside the more established and more static institutional stress tests. This allows us to stress test markets more efficiently, and, critically, as part of that test the assumptions that market participants make about the reactions and behaviour of each other, and thus of markets as a whole. This process of holding a mirror up is crucial. The second change is the introduction of a contingent liquidity facility for certain non-banks, designed to act as protection against stress in core markets.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a reaction taking place against regulation, and the responses to the GFC. We must not forget the lasting damage done by the GFC. There is no trade off between economic growth and financial stability. That said, there are usually choices about how we deal with evidence of vulnerabilities. It is critical that we have and develop tools of assessment and intervention. But these interventions may not always need to be more regulation. They can be liquidity facilities, and they can be to improve areas of the financial infrastructure, such as introducing clearing for gilt repo, a conclusion of our SWES. We should approach the response to vulnerabilities with an open mind.</p>

<title>Statement On Pause In Litigation Concerning The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today acting Chairman Uyeda, without the input of the full Commission, has instructed the staff to ask the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to delay scheduling oral arguments in litigation challenging the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-change-021125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s briefs, &ldquo;do not reflect [the acting Chairman&rsquo;s] views,&rdquo; he wrote in a statement. As such, the court should be &ldquo;notified&rdquo; of certain changes, such as the change in composition of the Commission, and the recent Presidential Memorandum regarding a Regulatory Freeze.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-change-021125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The acting Chairman&rsquo;s public statement on the litigation quoted from his and Commissioner Peirce&rsquo;s statements at the time the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was adopted. To complete the proverbial picture, I noted then<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-change-021125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;(and reiterate now) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>As reflected in the comment file, investors, &ldquo;for years,&rdquo; have been calling for &ldquo;consistent, comparable, and reliable climate risk disclosures.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Commission has clear authority under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act to require disclosures that are in the public interest.... This well-established authority has been consistently relied upon, and affirmed and reaffirmed across dozens of disclosure rulemakings over multiple decades.&rdquo; Under this deep-rooted framework &ldquo;[o]ur disclosures cannot remain stagnant; we must provide investors the information they need to understand the risks associated with their public company investments in today&rsquo;s world. A different outcome would harm the markets and investors.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The critiques that I have heard about our rulemaking attempt to disguise our authority as something that it is not. It is said that we are not an environmental agency and that we should not be in the business of supporting green agendas or setting pollution standards. Those statements are true. But, we are in the business of requiring public company disclosure about risk. We have done it myriad times without having our authority questioned.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the acting Chairman that agencies and those who lead them must act within the boundaries of constitutional and statutory authority. Nonetheless, I dispute with equal vigor the notion that the agency acted outside of its remit. It did not. The only things that have changed since the Rule was passed have been matters of politics and not substance. As such, I disagree with the position unilaterally taken today by the acting Chairman.</p>

<title>Semiannual Monetary Policy Report To The Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, Before The Committee On Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/semiannual-monetary-policy-report-to-the-congress-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-2025211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/semiannual-monetary-policy-report-to-the-congress-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-2025211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/mpr_default.htm">Monetary Policy Report</a>.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on achieving its dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions have cooled from their formerly overheated state and remain solid. Inflation has moved much closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. We are attentive to the risks on both sides of our mandate.</p>
<p>I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Current Economic Situation and Outlook</strong><br />Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product rose 2.5 percent in 2024, bolstered by resilient consumer spending. Investment in equipment and intangibles appears to have declined in the fourth quarter but was solid for the year overall. Following weakness in the middle of last year, activity in the housing sector seems to have stabilized.</p>
<p>In the labor market, conditions remain solid and appear to have stabilized. Payroll job gains averaged 189,000 per month over the past four months. Following earlier increases, the unemployment rate has been steady since the middle of last year and, at 4 percent in January, remains low. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year, and the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The strong labor market conditions in recent years have helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20250211a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in December, and, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Since last September, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the policy rate by a full percentage point from its peak after having maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for 14 months. That recalibration of our policy stance was appropriate in light of the progress on inflation and the cooling in the labor market. Meanwhile, we have continued to reduce our securities holdings.</p>
<p>With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p>As the economy evolves, we will adjust our policy stance in a manner that best promotes our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. If the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent, we can maintain policy restraint for longer. If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly. We are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate, and policy is well positioned to deal with the risks and uncertainties that we face.</p>
<p>This year, we are conducting the second periodic review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications&mdash;the framework used to pursue our congressionally assigned goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The focus of this review is on the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee's approach to monetary policy, and on the Committee's policy communications tools. The Committee's 2 percent longer-run inflation goal will be retained and will not be a focus of the review.</p>
<p>Our review will include outreach and public events involving a wide range of parties, including&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events around the country and a research conference in May. We will take on board lessons of the past five years and adapt our approach where appropriate to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable. We intend to wrap up the review by late summer.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by emphasizing that at the Fed, we will do everything we can to achieve the two goals Congress set for monetary policy&mdash;maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to supporting maximum employment, bringing inflation sustainably to our 2 percent goal, and keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Our success in delivering on these goals matters to all Americans. We understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.</p>
<p>Thank you. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>Acting SEC Chairman, Mark T. Uyeda,  Statement On Climate-Related Disclosure Rules</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today, I am taking action on The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors rule that was adopted by the Commission on March 6, 2024 (the &ldquo;Rule&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Rule is currently being challenged in litigation consolidated in the Eighth Circuit<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;and the Commission previously stayed effectiveness of the Rule pending completion of that litigation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The Rule is deeply flawed and could inflict significant harm on the capital markets and our economy.</p>
<p>Both Commissioner Peirce and I voted against the Rule&rsquo;s adoption.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Commissioner Peirce said that then-existing disclosure rules were sufficient and that the &ldquo;[R]ule&rsquo;s anticipated benefits do not outweigh the costs.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;She argued that &ldquo;only a mandate from Congress should put us in the business of facilitating the disclosure of information not clearly related to financial returns.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;I stated that the Commission was &ldquo;without statutory authority or expertise&rdquo; to address climate change issues and that &ldquo;this [R]ule is climate regulation promulgated under the Commission&rsquo;s seal.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>During the comment period, many submissions likewise urged that the Rule not be adopted. Among the reasons were that the Rule would require a large volume of financially immaterial information, financially material climate-related risks were already subject to disclosure under existing rules, and the proposed rules overstepped the SEC&rsquo;s regulatory authority.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s briefs previously submitted in the cases consolidated in the Eighth Circuit do not reflect my views. The briefs defend the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of the Rule, but I continue to question the statutory authority of the Commission to adopt the Rule, the need for the Rule, and the evaluation of costs and benefits. I also question whether the agency followed the proper procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt the Rule.</p>
<p>The lack of statutory authority is a weighty factor. Commissioners have a constitutional obligation to determine the bounds of the agency&rsquo;s statutory authority, and my views on the Commission&rsquo;s authority here were the result of lengthy study and research informed by many comments on all sides of the issue.</p>
<p>These views, the recent change in the composition of the Commission, and the recent Presidential Memorandum regarding a Regulatory Freeze,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-climate-change-021025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;bear on the conduct of this litigation. I believe that the Court and the parties should be notified of these changes.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have directed the Commission staff to notify the Court of the changed circumstances and request that the Court not schedule the case for argument to provide time for the Commission to deliberate and determine the appropriate next steps in these cases. The Commission will promptly notify the Court of its determination about its positions in the litigation.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury: United States, Australia, And The United Kingdom Jointly Sanction Key Infrastructure That Enables Ransomware Attacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Australia&rsquo;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office are jointly designating Zservers, a Russia- based bulletproof hosting (BPH) services provider, for its role in supporting LockBit ransomware attacks. LockBit, a Russia-based ransomware group best known for its ransomware variant of the same name, is one of the most deployed ransomware variants and was responsible for the November 2023 attack against the Industrial Commercial Bank of China U.S. broker- dealer. BPH service providers sell access to specialized servers and other computer infrastructure designed to evade detection and defy law enforcement attempts to disrupt these malicious activities. OFAC is also designating two Russian nationals who are key administrators of&nbsp;<b>Zservers</b>&nbsp;and have enabled ransomware attacks and other criminal activity.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on U.S. and international critical infrastructure,&rdquo; said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>This action builds on last year&rsquo;s trilateral cyber sanctions with Australia and the United Kingdom against Russian ransomware actor&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fjy2041/1/01010194f51b6bb0-11746899-99c5-4d4d-af7e-1c804a2f3745-000000/ggUV8Qa-DwJ-vNrmeeqJPMW866HdPZdroWnj6f2lxII=391" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Alexander Ermakov</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases%2Fjy2623/1/01010194f51b6bb0-11746899-99c5-4d4d-af7e-1c804a2f3745-000000/OfzB2Q-Qhh9fa5O6Ztbea3VuqfhXUv5NityhX2c92Gg=391" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">members of the Evil Corp ransomware group</a>. It also reflects a shared commitment to combatting cybercrime and degrading the support networks that enable bad actors to target victims in the United States and in allied countries. This action was developed with the support of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>ZSERVERS: A RUSSIAN BULLETPROOF HOSTING SERVICES PROVIDER SUPPORTING RANSOMWARE AND CYBERCRIME&nbsp;</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span><b>Zservers</b>, headquartered in Barnaul, Russia, has advertised BPH services on known cybercriminal forums to evade law enforcement investigations and takedowns, as well as scrutiny from cybersecurity firms. Zservers has provided BPH services, including leasing numerous IP addresses, to LockBit affiliates, who have used the hosting services to coordinate and launch ransomware attacks. During a 2022 search of a known LockBit affiliate, Canadian law enforcement uncovered a laptop operating a virtual machine that was connected to a Zservers&rsquo; subleased IP address and running a programming interface used to operate LockBit malware. In 2022, a Russian cybercriminal purchased IP addresses from Zservers, almost certainly for use as Lockbit chat servers to discuss ransomware operations. In 2023, Zservers leased infrastructure, including a Russian IP address, to a Lockbit affiliate.</span></p>
<p><span>OFAC is designating Zservers pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as further amended by E.O. 14144, for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, LockBit ransomware, a cyber- enabled activity originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or substantial part, outside the United States that is reasonably likely to result in, or has materially contributed to, a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that has the purpose of or involves causing a misappropriation of funds or economic resources, intellectual property, proprietary or business confidential information, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.</span></p>
<p><span>KEY ZSERVERS PERSONNEL</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alexander Igorevich Mishin (Mishin)</strong>&nbsp;is a Russian national and administrator of Zservers. Mishin has marketed Zservers&rsquo; BPH services to cybercriminals, including LockBit affiliates and other ransomware groups, with the understanding that they would use those services in their cybercriminal activities. He has also directed virtual currency transactions to be made in support of those activities.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Aleksandr Sergeyevich Bolshakov (Bolshakov)</strong>&nbsp;is a Russian national and administrator of Zservers. In 2023, Bolshakov and Mishin shut down an IP address in response to a complaint from a Lebanese company alleging that a Zservers-associated IP address had implemented Lockbit in a ransomware attack. Zservers likely enabled ransomware attacks to continue by assigning a new IP address to the malicious Lockbit user. Mishin instructed Bolshakov to change the IP address of the malicious user and then told the Lebanese company that the original IP address was cut off.</span></p>
<p><span>OFAC is designating Mishin and Bolshakov pursuant to E.O. 13694, as further amended by<br />E.O. 14144, for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Zservers, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13694, as further amended by E.O. 14144.</span></p>
<p><span>SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS</span></p>
<p><span>As a result of today&rsquo;s action, all property and interests in property of the blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC&rsquo;s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</span></p>
<p><span>Violations of OFAC regulations may result in civil or criminal penalties. OFAC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fofac.treasury.gov%2Fmedia%2F7566%2Fdownload%3Finline/1/01010194f51b6bb0-11746899-99c5-4d4d-af7e-1c804a2f3745-000000/z7_P5SposVmWNZ2CKpoVxf4iGXGP-jObwSOIS-eUhFU=391" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines</a>&nbsp;provide more information regarding OFAC&rsquo;s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext has announced a new&nbsp;</span><span>collaboration with Euroclear to support the development of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management services for repo and other asset classes.&nbsp;</span><span>The initiative is a major step to enable Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to expand its leading Italian repo clearing franchise to a large range of European government bonds bringing an efficient value offering to European and international clients.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Clearing will use Euroclear as its first triparty agent to enable enhanced collateral management capabilities. Leveraging on Euroclear&rsquo;s solutions, Euronext Clearing will offer clients automated, streamlined and flexible collateral solutions, improving operational efficiency and margin and balance sheet optimisation. Euroclear will act as an independent third party, managing the selection, valuation and substitution of collateral to ensure it meets eligibility criteria while optimising operational efficiency. It will also handle settlement and custody, provide regular reporting and ensure regulatory compliance, allowing clients to benefit from improved liquidity management and a reduced administrative burden.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The support of Euroclear&rsquo;s collateral management infrastructure, which handles an average in daily collateral, will strengthen Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s ability to deliver efficient, scalable services that address the evolving needs of its clients, with additional partnerships expected to further reinforce this approach.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This initiative builds on Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s unique position in the Italian repo market, where it already clears a significant portion of MTS repo activity, and lays the foundation for the next phase of the Euronext Clearing repo expansion to new European geographies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Clearing has undergone remarkable development in the last three years, evolving from a domestic central clearing house into the third-largest European clearing house. The integration of clearing operations across multiple geographies, diverse markets and various asset classes has solidified Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s position as a European leader.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Collaborating with Euroclear will pave the way for the rollout of Euronext&rsquo;s new repo clearing offering in June 2025, enabling the onboarding of clients including international banks, with an updated risk framework. Clients will be able to use Euroclear as a triparty agent for repo clearing.</span></p>

<title>SEC: Exemption From The Requirement To Report Certain Personally Identifiable Information To The Consolidated Audit Trail</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided an exemption from the requirement to report certain personally identifiable information (PII) &ndash; names, addresses, and years of birth &ndash; to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) for natural persons.&nbsp; Bad actors have become increasingly sophisticated and, in the event of a breach, may be able to use the names, addresses, and years of birth to impersonate a customer or broker-dealer and gain access to a customer&rsquo;s account. Providing an exemption from the requirement to report this PII to the CAT will help mitigate potential security risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over 12 years ago, the CAT was designed with the goal of creating a modernized audit trail system to enable regulators to analyze and reconstruct market events,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s exemptive order eliminates the requirement to report names, addresses, and years of birth for any U.S. natural person who trades in the stock market and recognizes that such information is not necessary to achieve CAT&rsquo;s objectives. Despite today&rsquo;s action, bad actors and other miscreants who engage in insider trading, market manipulation, and other schemes should be forewarned that the Commission has more than sufficient investigative tools to hold them accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Names, addresses, and years of birth were originally required to be collected in the CAT to facilitate the generation of unique anonymized customer IDs and to help regulators identify the person(s) responsible for a trade. In 2020, the Commission issued an order exempting the reporting of some of the most sensitive PII, including social security numbers. Today, the Commission issued an order exempting additional PII from the CAT. The CAT will still be able to generate reliable and consistent anonymized customer IDs even if such PII is not reported to the CAT.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On SEC’s Exemption From The Requirement To Report Certain Personally Identifiable Information To The Consolidated Audit Trail</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-38?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">exemption</a>&nbsp;from the requirement to report certain personally identifiable information to the Consolidated Audit Trail which was provided today by the Securities and Exchange Commission:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA applauds the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for taking this appropriate action to exempt the reporting of American investors&rsquo; personally identifiable information (PII) to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).&nbsp; For a decade, SIFMA has expressed strong concerns on behalf of the industry and investors that the information in the CAT&mdash;the largest database of retail and institutional trading ever created&mdash;was a ripe target for cyber criminals and collecting PII put investors&rsquo; data at risk.&nbsp; We have repeatedly called on the SEC to prohibit the collection of investors&rsquo; personal information and proposed alternatives that address the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement concerns without the need to collect such data.&nbsp; This bold decision by the Commission is entirely appropriate and long overdue.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Declawing The CAT: Statement On Consolidated Audit Trail Exemptive Relief, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Data are the foundation of advancement. They sit at the heart of innovation, technology, learning, community building, and so many other values crucial to our progress. Data can also be a critical tool in preventing fraud and wrongdoing.</p>
<p>But our data can also be deeply personal or subject to exploitation. That is why, when the government collects data, such collection must be done with due care and assurances that those who access our data are doing so with adequate guardrails and proper purpose. There must be processes and procedures followed to ensure responsible and appropriate use.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The fact that data are a powerful tool is not a reason to stop their collection altogether; rather, it is a reason to make use of data for significant and laudable goals&mdash;like protecting American business, investors, and the economy. We must weigh the law enforcement and regulatory benefits of the data collection against the potential costs.</p>
<p>The Consolidated Audit Trail (&ldquo;CAT&rdquo;) is a seminal example of how data collection can be used for good purpose. The CAT helps make our markets safer, more efficient, and can act as a powerful tool in ferreting out wrongdoing. Yet today, by eliminating critical data collection, we undermine its use and our own effectiveness. We are wiping away the fingerprints from the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>The agency adopted the CAT after the 2010 &ldquo;Flash Crash&rdquo; when U.S. markets collapsed and then partially rebounded in less than an hour.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The whiplash in prices undermined market confidence and caused significant investor losses.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;It was clear following the crash that regulators, including this agency, were unprepared to respond to a market event of that magnitude. A complete regulatory response would have required a full and robust analysis of data we did not have.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;It ultimately took the SEC nearly five months to determine the root causes of the crash,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and to this day, the Commission does not have a sense of who was harmed.</p>
<p>We must be more responsive than that. For quick and effective oversight in a crisis, regulators need access to a timely and comprehensive set of data&mdash;whether we are trying to figure out a major market event like the Flash Crash, investigate fraud, or identify suspicious foreign activity that may indicate market manipulation or infiltration. The CAT was designed to address outdated regulatory infrastructure by improving the completeness, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of data needed to support robust regulatory oversight.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And, in fact, it has.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, today we eliminate the CAT&rsquo;s collection of the most basic customer identifying information,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;thus impairing regulators&rsquo; ability to understand suspicious activity, unwind events, or stave off market disruptions. Today&rsquo;s order itself acknowledges the negative impact this will have on regulatory efficiency but fails to grapple with the consequences of these diminished capabilities. It leaves unanswered the most basic questions. For example, will it be more difficult for regulators to spot fraud? How much harder will it be to identify certain types of market manipulation? Will it be more difficult to identify and address concerns relating to certain foreign ownership? Will it be more difficult to identify and compensate the victims of swindlers? In times of market disruption and ongoing fraud or manipulation, loss of time means loss of money and loss in market confidence. There is no question that this decision is a loss for markets and investor protection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-consolidated-audit-trail-021025#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Given that protecting the security and confidentiality of Consolidated Audit Trail data has long been a priority of the Commission, there are safeguards in place to protect this information. For example, Rule 613(e)(4)(i)(A) requires policies and procedures to ensure the security and confidentiality of all information reported to the CAT&rsquo;s central repository by requiring that the Participants and their employees agree to use appropriate safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of such data and agree not to use such data for any purpose other than surveillance and regulatory purposes. In addition, Rule 613(e)(4)(i)(B) requires the Participants adopt and enforce rules that require information barriers between regulatory staff and nonregulatory staff with regard to access and use of data in the central repository and permit only persons designated by plan sponsors to have access to the data in the central repository. Moreover, Rule 613(e)(4)(i)(C) requires that the Plan Processor develop and maintain a comprehensive information security program for the central repository, with dedicated staff, that is subject to regular reviews by the Chief Compliance Officer; have a mechanism to confirm the identity of all persons permitted to access the data; and maintain a record of all instances where such persons access the data.</p>

The Commission adopted Rule 613 to require self-regulatory organizations (&ldquo;SROs&rdquo;) to submit a national market system plan to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated order tracking system, or consolidated audit trail, with respect to the trading of NMS securities, that would capture customer and order event information for such securities, across all markets, from the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or execution ( the &ldquo;CAT Plan&rdquo; or &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;).

Although the SROs and the Commission quickly implemented a single-stock circuit breaker pilot program as an initial response, a more complete regulatory response required a full and robust analysis of additional data.

SEC staff encountered major problems that hindered their ability to figure out what happened during the Flash Crash, such as not being able to accurately sequence events across the multiple data sources or identify and eliminate duplicate orders.

<title>US Department Of Justice: Alabama Man Pleads Guilty In Connection With Securities And Exchange Commission X Account Hack</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-department-of-justice-alabama-man-pleads-guilty-in-connection-with-securitie-2025211/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Alabama man pleaded guilty today in connection with the January 2024 unauthorized takeover of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&rsquo;s social media account on X, formerly known as Twitter, in which hackers posted a fraudulent message in the name of the then-SEC Chairman, temporarily causing the value of Bitcoin (BTC) to increase by more than $1,000.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Eric Council Jr., 25, of Athens, conspired with others who took unauthorized control of the SEC&rsquo;s X account and falsely announced that the SEC approved BTC Exchange Traded Funds, a decision highly anticipated by the market. Immediately following the false announcement, the price of BTC increased by more than $1,000 per bitcoin. Shortly after this unauthorized post, the SEC regained control over its X account and confirmed that the announcement was false and the result of a security breach. Following the correction, the value of BTC decreased by more than $2,000 per bitcoin.</p>
<p>The conspirators gained control of the SEC&rsquo;s X account through an unauthorized Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap carried out by Council. A SIM swap refers to the process of fraudulently inducing a cell phone carrier to reassign a cell phone number from the legitimate subscriber or user&rsquo;s SIM card to a SIM card controlled by a criminal actor. As part of the scheme, Council used an identification card printer to create a fraudulent identification card with a victim&rsquo;s personally identifiable information obtained from his co-conspirators. Council used the fraudulent identification card to impersonate the victim and gain access to the victim&rsquo;s cellular phone number for the purpose of accessing the SEC&rsquo;s account. Council&rsquo;s co-conspirators then accessed the account and posted in the name of the SEC Chairman. Council received payment in bitcoin from his co-conspirators for his role.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Council pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 16 and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>Supervisory Official Antoinette T. Bacon of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia; Special Agent in Charge Sean Ryan of the FBI Washington Field Office, Criminal and Cyber Division; and SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI Washington Field Office and SEC Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Ashley Pungello of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Trial Attorney Lauren Archer of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Rosenberg for the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case. Substantial assistance was provided by Cyber Fellow Paul M. Zebb III.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham and Commissioners Kristin N. Johnson, Christy Goldsmith Romero and Summer K. Mersinger issued the following statement:</p>

<title>CFTC: ‘Dating Or Defrauding?’ A Joint Effort To Alert Online Daters, Social Media Users Of Relationship Investment Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In coordination with multiple federal, state, and nonprofit organizations, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach has launched&nbsp;a national awareness effort to alert the public to relationship investment scams targeting Americans through wrong-numbered texts, dating apps, and social media.<em></em></p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, the interagency&nbsp;<em>Dating or Defrauding?</em>&nbsp;social media awareness campaign will warn Americans to be skeptical of any request from online friends for cryptocurrency, gift cards, wire transfers, or other forms of payment. Other red flags include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A prolonged inability to meet in-person.<span></span></li>
<li>Moving conversations off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps.<span></span></li>
<li>Repeated suggestions for investments or requests for money.<span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>The joint initiative will provide information about how to recognize relationship investment scams, what to do if you are affected, and why to share the information to warn others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, criminals are better able to hide their identities, create more fake profiles, phishing emails, and more convincing scam websites than ever before,&rdquo; said OCEO Director Melanie Devoe. &ldquo;Valentine&rsquo;s Day and the following weeks provide an excellent opportunity to remind people that criminals are using social media, dating, and messaging apps to scam Americans. We ask you to be alert, and to help stop scams by warning your friends and family.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the campaign, participating organizations will use the #DatingOrDefrauding hashtag and direct users to helpful resources. In addition to the CFTC, participating agencies include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal agencies</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>FBI, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Federal Trade Commission, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General, and&nbsp;<span>U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</span></li>
<li><strong>State agencies:</strong>&nbsp;Arizona Corporation Commission, U.S. Virgin Islands Office of the Lieutenant Governor, Oregon&nbsp;<span>Division of Financial Regulation</span>, Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, and Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.</li>
<li><span><strong>Non-governmental organizations:</strong>&nbsp;FINRA and NFA.&nbsp;</span><strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></p>
<p>Relationship investment scams are a recent type of romance fraud,&nbsp;<span>causing&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/annualreport/reports/2023_ic3report.pdf"><span>reported losses to the FBI&nbsp;</span></a><span>of nearly $4 billion in 2023.&nbsp;</span>Called pig butchering by the perpetrators, criminals use dating apps, social media platforms, messaging apps, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target possible victims. The scammers are known to use fake profiles, images, videos and voices to make themselves appear attractive and professional, and once introduced, they send frequent messages to build relationships. These new online &ldquo;friends&rdquo; claim to have made a lot of money trading cryptocurrency, precious metals, or foreign currency, thanks to special knowledge or insider help. The scammers talk about how easy it is and offer to help victims earn extra money. Victims are then directed to fraudulent trading platforms operated by the same organized criminal gangs.</p>
<p>These scams do not discriminate and have victimized people of all ages. People who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/isolated.html">live alone</a>&nbsp;or spend a lot of time on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/nothing_to_like_about_social_media_scammers.html">social media</a>&nbsp;or in discussion groups tend to be more vulnerable to fraud. Scams work because they appeal to unmet needs or emotions, like financial stress, excitement, or fear. The good news is that awareness can reduce victimization. Sharing information could help protect those closest to you.</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the&nbsp;<em>Dating or Defrauding?</em>&nbsp;effort, the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach is releasing a customer advisory<span>,&nbsp;</span><em>Help Warn Others About Relationship Investment Scams</em>, that explains the fraud in detail and steps the public can take to help others.</p>
<p>The CFTC has previously alerted customers to romance frauds including the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Dating or Defrauding?</em>&nbsp;campaign in 2022. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8491-22">8491-22</a>]. The CFTC also issued customer advisories&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CustomerAdvisory_RomanceScam.html">Avoid Forex, Precious Metals, and Digital Asset Romance Scams</a>. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8492-22">8492-22</a>] and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/RomanceScam.html">Six Warning Signs of Online Financial Romance Frauds</a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></span></p>
<p><span>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups.

<p class="text-align-center"><span><strong>Customer Advisory:&nbsp;Help Warn Others About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></span><span><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Scammers are using smart phones, social media or dating sites, and cryptocurrency to steal billions of dollars from Americans. Over the coming month, the CFTC is joining with other federal, state, and nonprofit organizations to raise awareness about these horrible crimes. You can help too: Warn your friends and family by sharing #DatingOrDefauding information and links.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Relationship investment scams, called&nbsp;</span><em>pig butchering</em><span>&nbsp;by the perpetrators, use dating apps, social media platforms,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/MessagingApps.html">messaging apps</a><span>, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target possible victims. The fraudsters use fake profiles, images, videos and voices to make them appear attractive and professional. Once introduced, they send frequent messages to build relationships. The new online &ldquo;friends&rdquo; claim to have made a lot of money trading cryptocurrency, precious metals, or foreign currency, thanks to special knowledge or insider help. The scammers talk about how easy it is and offer to help targets earn extra money. Targets are then directed to fraudulent trading platforms operated by the same organized criminal gangs.</span></p>
<p><span>Victims are told to convert their dollars to cryptocurrency and then send the crypto to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/SpotFraudSites.pdf">scam website</a><span>. They see their balances on the websites grow substantially and are encouraged to withdraw small amounts of money to spend on themselves. This is another ploy to build trust.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/node/253556">Research</a><span>&nbsp;reveals victims transfer an average of 10 payments, each larger than the last until they are financially drained.&nbsp;When victims try to make subsequent withdraws, they are refused or told they must pay additional fees or taxes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anyone Could be a Potential Victim</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Relationship investment scams do not discriminate and have victimized people of all ages. People who&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/isolated.html">live alone</a><span>&nbsp;or spend a lot of time on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/nothing_to_like_about_social_media_scammers.html">social media</a><span>&nbsp;or in discussion groups tend to be more vulnerable to fraud. Scams work because they appeal to unmet needs or emotions, like financial stress, excitement, or fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The good news is that awareness about specific scams can reduce victimization by up to 85 percent.</span><a href="https://gbc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/wordeditorframe.aspx?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;wopisrc=https%3A%2F%2Fcftcusgov.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2Fopa%2F_vti_bin%2Fwopi.ashx%2Ffiles%2F005115727ac249a19617084f11da42aa&amp;wdlor=c85BDB46C-9A0A-410E-8A30-DB17F1DC4390&amp;wdenableroaming=1&amp;mscc=1&amp;hid=A89B2267-1A92-4C45-99D7-A465B887A5FC.0&amp;uih=sharepointcom&amp;wdlcid=en-US&amp;jsapi=1&amp;jsapiver=v2&amp;corrid=41504e13-2491-b825-495a-c7568e9d28e6&amp;usid=41504e13-2491-b825-495a-c7568e9d28e6&amp;newsession=1&amp;sftc=1&amp;uihit=docaspx&amp;muv=1&amp;cac=1&amp;sams=1&amp;mtf=1&amp;sfp=1&amp;sdp=1&amp;hch=1&amp;hwfh=1&amp;dchat=1&amp;sc=%7B%22pmo%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fcftcusgov.sharepoint.com%22%2C%22pmshare%22%3Atrue%7D&amp;ctp=LeastProtected&amp;rct=Normal&amp;wdorigin=Outlook-Body.Sharing.ServerTransfer.LOF&amp;wdhostclicktime=1738172007109&amp;csc=1&amp;instantedit=1&amp;wopicomplete=1&amp;wdredirectionreason=Unified_SingleFlush#_ftn1"><span><span>[1]</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;Sharing information during the Dating or Defrauding Campaign could help protect those closest to you.</span></p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders Florida Man To Pay Over $7.6 Million For Digital Asset Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a consent order against&nbsp;<strong>Randall Crater</strong>&nbsp;of Heathrow, Florida.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The order requires Crater to pay over $</span><span>7.6 million&nbsp;</span><span>in restitution to defrauded victims in connection with his digital asset fraud scheme, with dollar-for-dollar credit for restitution payments to victims in satisfaction of the restitution ordered in a parallel criminal action. The order also imposes a permanent injunction against Crater and bans him from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets, entering into any transactions involving commodity interests or digital asset commodities, and registering with the CFTC.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The consent order finds from at least January 2014 through January 2018, Crater, together with other defendants named in CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint, operated a digital asset scheme in which they fraudulently offered the sale of a fully functioning virtual currency,&nbsp;<strong>My Big Coin</strong>, a commodity in interstate commerce.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Crater obtained more than $7.6 million from at least 28 customers through fraudulent solicitations, including false and misleading claims and omissions about MBC&rsquo;s value, use and trade status, and that MBC was backed by gold. He spent the misappropriated money to purchase, among other things, a home, antiques, fine art, jewelry, and other luxury goods.</span></p>
<p><span>The consent order resolves the claims against Crater in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action against him and co-defendants&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Mark Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., John Roche, and Michael Kruger</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;[See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7678-18"><span>7678-18</span></a><span>.] The enforcement action remains pending against the co-defendants.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>On Jan. 18, 2022, a grand jury returned an eight-count superseding indictment charging Crater with wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business based on the same conduct alleged in CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint. [</span><em><span>United States v. Randall Crater</span></em><span>, No. 1:19-cr-10063-DJC (D. Mass. Jan. 18, 2022)).] Crater was found guilty of those charges on July 21, 2022, and was sentenced to over eight years in prison and ordered to pay $7.6 million in restitution to defrauded customers and to forfeit&nbsp;</span><a name="_Hlk176509289"><span>$7.6 million,</span></a><span>&nbsp;which represented the proceeds he received from his violations.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, and the FBI.</span></p>
<p><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Jonah E. McCarthy, Patricia Gomersall, Daniel Ullman II, Paul G. Hayeck, and former staff members Jason Mahoney, John Einstman, Kyong J. Koh, and Hillary Van Tassel.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered an order against&nbsp;<strong>Rashawn Russell,&nbsp;</strong>a New York resident, in a CFTC action charging Russell with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation of investor assets obtained for the purported purpose of trading digital assets on behalf of customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order requires Russell to pay over $1.5 million in restitution to defrauded victims. The order also permanently enjoins Russell from engaging in conduct that violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, permanently bans him from registering with the CFTC and from solicitation for and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets on behalf of third parties, and bans him from trading for himself for a period of eight years. The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s action against Russell.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8686-23">8686-23</a>]<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The order, stemming from a CFTC complaint filed April 11, 2023, finds from November 2020 to August 2022 Russell engaged in a fraudulent digital assets trading scheme in which he solicited more than two dozen retail customers to contribute bitcoin, ether, and fiat currency to invest in his purported proprietary digital assets trading fund. The order further finds Russell intentionally and/or recklessly made false and misleading statements regarding the fund&rsquo;s structure, size, and performance to obtain and retain investors; failed to trade the money and assets as represented; and, falsely promised to pay withdrawal requests.

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.validusrm.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Validus Risk Management</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Validus&rdquo;), a leading software and tech-enabled services platform for financial risk management, today announced that it has secured a $45 million growth equity investment from&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://ftvcapital.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FTV Capital</a>, a sector-focused growth equity firm with a successful track record of investing in enterprise and financial technology. The minority investment will enable Validus to accelerate its go-to-market efforts, further expand into the United States and APAC while continuing to penetrate the European market, and invest in technology and product innovation.</p>
<p>The global market for alternative assets has grown at an approximately 12% CAGR for the last decade to over $13 trillion of assets under management in 2024. As private markets evolve and become more complex, investment firms increasingly demand specialized technology and services to manage market risks, optimize internal processes and seek operational efficiencies. Combining award-winning technology, expert resources and a deep understanding of private markets, Validus delivers innovative software and tech-enabled solutions to fund managers across private debt, private equity, secondaries, infrastructure and real estate. Validus serves over 750 funds globally whose managers have $3.2 trillion in combined assets under management, and the company has consistently demonstrated profitability, with significant year-on-year recurring revenue growth.</p>
<p>Commenting on the investment,&nbsp;<b>Kevin Lester, co-founder and chief executive officer at Validus, said</b>, &ldquo;For the past 15 years, our relentless commitment to excellence has been the foundation of our success. We are proud to serve some of the world&rsquo;s largest private capital managers, while maintaining a culture that never stands still. Innovation drives us&mdash;whether through designing customized hedging strategies or developing technology that streamlines operations, mitigates risk, and enhances efficiency for our clients. With the backing of FTV Capital, we are poised to scale faster and deliver even greater value to our growing client base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The global alternative asset industry is massive and growing, yet risk management has been largely overlooked,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Mike Cichowski, partner at FTV Capital.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Validus fills this gap in the market, delivering a comprehensive platform and innovative technology solutions that not only address risk management but also drive operational efficiencies in the middle-office. Validus has demonstrated its success and potential, consistently growing market share profitably and proving itself as the solution of choice for many of the world&rsquo;s leading private capital firms. We&rsquo;re thrilled to lead this investment and look forward to partnering with Kevin and the Validus team to accelerate the company&rsquo;s growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Haakon Blakstad, chief commercial officer at Validus, added,</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;In addition to FTV&rsquo;s track record in financial services and technology, we were impressed with their understanding of our particular sector and enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead. Our partnership is about far more than capital; we believe that the strategic support, operating resources and network that FTV will provide are worth many times more than the investment itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of this investment, Cichowski will join the Validus board of directors. Walter Global Asset Management will remain on the board as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.</p>

<p>The Tender Offers are being made upon the terms and subject to conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, dated&nbsp;February 10, 2025&nbsp;(as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the &ldquo;Offer to Purchase&rdquo;), which sets forth a detailed description of the Tender Offers. The Company reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase or decrease any or all of the Series Notes Caps and/or the Aggregate Notes Cap in its sole discretion at any time without extending or reinstating withdrawal rights, subject to compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>The Tender Offers for the Notes will expire at&nbsp;5:00 p.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;March 11, 2025, or any other date and time to which the Company extends the applicable Tender Offer (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the &ldquo;Expiration Date&rdquo;), unless earlier terminated. Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at&nbsp;5:00 p.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;February 24, 2025&nbsp;(such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the &ldquo;Early Tender Date&rdquo;), and the holder&rsquo;s Notes must be accepted for purchase, to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below). If a holder validly tenders Notes after the applicable Early Tender Date but prior to or at the applicable Expiration Date, and the holder&rsquo;s Notes are accepted for purchase, the holder will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below).</p>
<p>Subject to the Aggregate Notes Cap, the Series Notes Caps and proration, if applicable, the total consideration for each&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;principal amount of the Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to each Tender Offer will be calculated in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable Fixed Spread for such Notes specified in the table above plus the applicable yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at&nbsp;10:00 a.m.,&nbsp;New York City&nbsp;time, on&nbsp;February 25, 2025 (excluding Accrued Interest with respect to each series of Notes, the &ldquo;Total Consideration&rdquo;).&nbsp;The Total Consideration includes an applicable early tender premium per&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase as set forth in the table above (with respect to each series of Notes, the &ldquo;Early Tender Premium&rdquo;).

<p>In addition to the consideration described above, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes to, but not including, the applicable settlement date (&ldquo;Accrued Interest&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Company intends to fund the purchase of validly tendered and accepted Notes with available cash on hand and other sources of liquidity. The purpose of the Tender Offers is to purchase a portion of the Notes, subject to the Aggregate Notes Cap and the Series Notes Caps, in order to reduce the Company&rsquo;s total outstanding public debt.</p>
<p>The Tender Offers will expire on the applicable Expiration Date. Except as set forth below, payment for the Notes that are validly tendered prior to or at the Expiration Date and that are accepted for purchase will be made on a date promptly following the Expiration Date, which is currently anticipated to be&nbsp;March 14, 2025, the third business day after the Expiration Date.

</p>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good morning and thank you so much for joining us. Today we are here to discuss recent changes we have made to the Bank of England&rsquo;s (the Bank&rsquo;s) regulatory and supervisory frameworks for Financial Market Infrastructure (FMIs) and our priorities for FMI regulation this year.</p>
<p>We are in a time, and in a sector, of sweeping technological advances, posing exciting opportunities to innovate within, and grow, the UK economy. As FMIs and regulators, we need to seize these opportunities, while understanding and mitigating the risks that come with them. In a context of heightened geopolitical tensions, embracing opportunities to find new, more effective ways of working, while ensuring FMIs&rsquo; resilience has never been more crucial.</p>
<p>Our priorities for the year will help you deliver on that ambition. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient.</li>
<li>Safe and sustainable innovation.</li>
<li>Financial resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient. Cyber and third-party providers pose some of the most significant risks here that need managing. Our policies set the framework for achieving resilience and we will be looking at firms&rsquo; progress carefully in line with the March deadline.</p>
<p>Safe and sustainable innovation. We want you to embrace the benefits that innovation offers, while managing the risks it poses. For our part, we will ensure our regulatory and supervisory frameworks facilitate innovation while maintaining financial stability.</p>
<p>Financial resilience. While we&rsquo;ve had the benefit of relative market stability recently, especially compared to previous years, we can&rsquo;t take our eye off financial resilience. For central counterparties (CCPs) we will use stress testing and other tools to monitor and probe risks, improve transparency and target mitigation.</p>
<p>To achieve these priorities, we need to continue to work openly and cooperatively together to mitigate risks, embrace innovation, and safely provide the critical infrastructure on which the economy relies.</p>
<h3>Why FMIs matter and our desired outcomes</h3>
<p>UK FMIs are essential to the global financial system. Every time an individual or business makes a transaction, your firms work behind the scenes to ensure it is processed smoothly, reducing and managing risk, particularly during periods of stress. The scale of this work is immense.</p>
<p>Day in, day out, CCPs clear trillions of pounds worth of contracts, the UK&rsquo;s central security depository, Euroclear UK &amp; International (EUI) settles nearly a trillion pounds of securities transactions, and our payment systems process countless retail and wholesale transactions. Confidence in FMI services is critical to a vibrant and prosperous economy, facilitating growth by allowing other businesses, individuals and financial market participants to transact and take informed risk safely.</p>
<p>While you deliver these services, it&rsquo;s the Bank&rsquo;s role to provide a regulatory and supervisory framework that ensures financial stability while facilitating innovation and supporting the wider economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-remarks-chair-ceo-ineds-roundtable-for-uk-financial-market-infrastructure-firms#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Our common goal of financially and operationally resilient FMIs delivering trusted services is best met when we work together, with an open dialogue, and an understanding of each other&rsquo;s needs and constraints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is a consequence we need to acknowledge; in managing risk, FMIs centralise it. Disruption or operational outages at an FMI can trigger severe financial instability and economic consequences, especially given that the participants of FMIs are often systemically important institutions that rely on FMIs for their proper functioning, and in the case of UK CCPs, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) such as large banks. CCPs play a crucial role supporting trading and management of counterparty risk, while central security depositories (CSDs) ensure securities settle on time and play an important role in the liquidity and collateral chain. And payment systems are key to liquidity, supporting wholesale and retail payments across all sectors of the economy. What is clear is that any significant disruption to the operation of FMIs could rapidly escalate into broader financial and economic turmoil and a corresponding loss in confidence in the financial system. While thankfully it didn&rsquo;t severely impact your firms, last summer&rsquo;s Crowdstrike incident demonstrated the risks and importance of our work on operational resilience, outsourcing and third-party suppliers, to ensure firms take action ahead of time to identify risks to delivery of their critical services and make themselves resilient to disruption.</p>
<p>If we look back further, history offers a stark reminder of how costly financial crises can be. The 2008 financial crisis was the most significant growth-destroying event in recent memory, but also highlighted the value of FMIs in reducing risk. This was dramatically illustrated through the difference in the ease with which the creditors of the failed US investment bank Lehman Brothers were able to deal with the losses arising from its cleared derivatives portfolio, using collateral the firm had deposited at the CCPs it used, against the years they spent dealing with losses from uncleared positions.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/february/sasha-mills-remarks-chair-ceo-ineds-roundtable-for-uk-financial-market-infrastructure-firms#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;This relative success of CCPs during the crisis is part of what has made them such a central node of the financial system today. Supporting FMIs in playing this role in reducing risk, and ultimately avoiding a repeat of such a crisis, is the most important contribution we can make to sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a more shock prone world, with elevated volatility in part driven by geopolitical stress, it is critical that FMIs are aware of the potential risks they can create as they manage their own risks and the risks of other firms. Supported by the Bank of England,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/january/boe-and-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission">the international community has responded to risks around procyclicality of margin calls</a>, through new standards on margin transparency at CCPs which aim to improve centrally cleared market participants&rsquo; understanding of potential future margin requirements and margin responsiveness, helping to reduce the risk of severe procyclical effects in times of market volatility.</p>
<h3>Innovation: Playing our respective roles in embracing responsible innovation</h3>
<p>There has also been a step change in opportunities and risks arising from technological advances and we are committed to working with you to ensure we can embrace these opportunities safely. For payments, technological innovations are changing the landscape for providers, driven in large part by broader changes in what consumers expect. These advances will bring business opportunities and efficiencies as well as risks that need to be understood and managed. When safely implemented, they can also be used to help ensure resilience at FMIs, for instance through the huge potential in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to help monitor market activity and risk.</p>
<p>We need to work together to manage the risks and, importantly, make the most of the opportunities. As FMIs you will need to adapt your risk management strategies and business models to navigate this new environment effectively while making the most of the technological advances that could enable a step change in the services you provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits could be realised by bringing new technologies to existing firms (for example, through tokenisation or the introduction of atomic settlement) or through new types of FMIs joining the payments, settlement and clearing sectors. These technological advances are a good thing &ndash; but the risks need managing. We are keen to hear from you both on how you are innovating and the benefits that this is bringing, and any risks you see being created.</p>
<p>In line with our secondary objective to facilitate innovation, the Bank of England&rsquo;s role is to give you space to innovate in a way that protects financial stability. Our role in facilitating innovation can be both as catalyst, allowing safe experimentation through initiatives such as the Digital Securities Sandbox, but also by getting out of the way. Removing barriers allows your firms or new players to innovate to improve FMI services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also opportunities in RegTech allowing us to do our job more effectively, including to process approvals more efficiently. Increases in computing power and application of techniques like machine learning may also allow us to perform desk-based assessments of firm resilience that are higher frequency and wider in scope &ndash; for example, more regular stress tests against a wider range of scenarios.</p>
<h3>What we have done so far&nbsp;on our priorities</h3>
<p>Over the past year, the Bank has taken critical steps to evolve its approach with new powers and responsibilities in mind, while maintaining a robust commitment to financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have laid the groundwork for an FMI rulebook, through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/cp/fundamental-rules-for-financial-market-infrastructures">proposed Fundamental Rules</a>. This is an important and substantive area of work for the Bank to progress and clarify the outcomes we will require FMIs to meet. They are intended to drive board-level discussions about these outcomes and how firms can achieve them, supporting both our financial stability and innovation objectives.</p>
<p>We also refreshed our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/financial-market-infrastructure-supervision/what-do-we-do/the-bank-of-englands-approach-to-financial-market-infrastructure-supervision">approach to supervision</a>. Our supervisory approach is now more proportionate and risk-based, giving us greater flexibility to focus on the firms and issues that pose the greatest risks to our objectives, and providing us with more flexibility to choose to not intervene when we consider the costs outweigh the benefits. It also better accommodates the new and emerging risks that we see for FMIs.</p>
<p>In keeping with the thinking behind the Fundamental Rules, the supervisory approach will help ensure firms consider and reflect on the impact they can have on the financial system and the real economy in their decision making. Our new approach also ensures firms are prepared to work with the authorities in times of severe disruption.</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, we have made significant strides. We launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/november/operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-to-the-uk-financial-sector-policy-statement">Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime</a>&nbsp;and introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/cp/operational-resilience-operational-incident-and-outsourcing-and-third-party-reporting-for-fmis">proposals for operational incident and outsourcing reporting</a>, both of which help to ensure that the sectors&rsquo; operational resilience remains robust in the face of new challenges.&nbsp;We&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/stress-testing/2024/2024-ccp-supervisory-stress-test-results-report">stress-tested the financial resilience of CCPs</a>&nbsp;and contributed to international work on margin transparency.</p>
<p>We are also working with&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;to ensure your systems and processes are operationally resilient, given the end-of-March deadline for FMIs, to show us that they can remain within their impact tolerances when the critical services they offer are disrupted. You have been engaged in this work, with wargames, collaborative risk meetings and initiatives such as the Cross Market Operational Resilience Group.</p>
<p>Clearly there&rsquo;s more work for FMIs to do ahead of the end-March deadline. While this is a significant milestone, it is not the last piece of the puzzle. FMIs will need to continue to improve operational resilience as risks and technologies evolve. And be mindful of risks that could be posed by the process of introducing significant changes to the technology they use. Cyber threat actors who seek to harm the financial system will not stop developing their techniques, so FMIs need to remain vigilant to the changing threats they are exposed to. We as regulators need to work to ensure our requirements and guidance respond to those risks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s to come?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I wanted to return here to the three priorities that I set out at the start, building things out in a bit more detail.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk189149110"></a>Ensuring FMI services are operationally resilient: This remains a cornerstone of our work, and only grows in importance as geopolitical volatility increases. As well as working with you through the approaching deadline to meet our required standards, we will be focussing on embedding our oversight regime for CTPs and engaging with you on our operational incident and outsourcing requirements. We also plan to develop more detailed guidance to formalise our expectations on cyber resilience, in line with increased sophistication and risk of cyber events. This would have the aim of FMIs improving their ability to identify and prevent cyber incidents, advancing their capacity to test their resilience against potential incidents, and importantly detecting, responding, and recovering in a safe manner if defences are breached.</p>
<p>Facilitating safe and resilient innovation in payments, settlement and clearing: Through initiatives such as the Digital Securities Sandbox and the digital gilt (or DIGIT), we are focussed on facilitating innovation across payments, settlement and clearing in a way that drives growth while protecting financial stability. We are also implementing international standards for systemic stablecoins and will support innovation and enhancements within existing FMI services. As part of our work with HM Treasury (HMT) to repeal UK European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) for CCPs and replace it with Bank rules and relevant statutory provisions, together we are considering how we could simplify certain processes, such as for approving CCP margin models and authorising new products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring stability through financially resilient FMIs:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>For CCPs, we will propose rules to repeal EMIR and replace it with an adaptable and dynamic rulebook that aligns with evolving international standards, particularly on margin transparency. We will also engage with firms to further understand how changes in the clearing landscape impact your risk profile. We will also improve our use of data to monitor risks to financial and operational resilience.</p>
<p>Across all of this work, we will continue to improve our engagement with you &ndash; the FMIs we regulate. This year, we will finalise our Fundamental Rules after consultation &ndash; making clear our requirements across our regulatory priorities. Initiatives like the Fundamental Rules and our refreshed Supervisory Approach are part of this effort. However, we also want to find out how we can help you embrace innovative technologies and make sure that we are ready for the challenges ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With your help, we can seize the opportunities provided by both recent technological advances and our new powers and responsibilities to ensure:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>UK FMIs can thrive domestically and internationally, support growth through effective risk management, innovate safely and enhance resilience;</li>
<li>our Supervisory Approach remains strong and effective, is risk-based and flexible, and relevant to the shifting landscape of risks you engage with every day;</li>
<li>our regulatory framework balances high standards and certainty with the agility to address change, with rules that are clear and accessible, and supervisory actions that are outcomes focussed; and</li>
<li>we have a productive and open dialogue between regulators and industry with a &lsquo;no surprises&rsquo; culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>This vision is ambitious, but it is achievable with your engagement and collaboration. Thank you for your work so far in realising this vision, and for your invaluable contributions to this vital sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to thank James Hoskins, Richard Spooner, Joe Irwin, Sadia Arif, Charlotte Kelly, Barry King, Justin Jacobs, Simon Morley, Shane Scott, Sarah Breeden, Michael Yoganayagam and Harsh Mehta for their contribution to these remarks.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For January 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-january-2025-2025210/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s inaugural address for his second presidency reverberated through both U.S. and international markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast stronger U.S. economic growth while cautioning that dramatic policy shifts could create headwinds for other economies and complicate monetary easing efforts by central banks worldwide. In the aftermath, U.S. treasury yields pushed higher as the dollar extends its rally.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien </b>noted that the heavy concentration of U.S. market capitalization in a handful AI-technology stocks presents vulnerability to a major correction. Given the policy uncertainty, the Federal Reserve (Fed) may move toward monetary easing sooner than anticipated. This scenario could catalyze capital outflows from the U.S. market to emerging economies, with Thailand's stock market emerging as an attractive destination due to its low volatility, evidenced by the SET Index's end-of-day volatility. The Thai stock market's additional strength is the consistently strong dividend yield, with Thai stocks maintaining an average yield of 3.14 percent since 2000 to date. The Thai stock market thus positions itself as a compelling safe haven for investors pursuing defensive portfolio diversification.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for January</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of January 2025, the SET Index fell by 6.1 percent to close at 1,314.50 points. </li>
<li>Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Financials and Energy. </li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in January 2025 decreased 17.2 percent YoY to THB 39.01 billion (approx. USD 1.16 billion). However, local institutional investors' trading proportion demonstrated an upward trend, staying above 10 percent of total trading value for four consecutive months. </li>
<li>In January, there was one newly listed company on mai, namely Pro Inside pcl (PIS).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of January 2025 was 15.0 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.6 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.7 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 14.2 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of January 2025 was 3.64 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.28 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in January 2025 averaged 391,493 contracts, down 27.3 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 dropped 27.3 percent to 391,493 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<title>WFE FY24 Market Data: Americas Region Leading Global Markets Despite Lowest Level Of IPOs Worldwide In The Last 5 Years</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New data published by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and CCPs, shows the buoyancy of the Americas region, which continues to lead global markets despite the lowest level of IPOs worldwide in the last 5 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of IPOs globally fell to the lowest level in the last 5 years, driven by the APAC and EMEA regions, but the number of IPOs in the Americas increased.</li>
<li>The Americas and APAC regions reached record trading volumes and market capitalisation, whilst EMEA declined across both indicators.</li>
<li>The Americas region&nbsp;reached its highest market capitalisation in the last 5 years, driven mostly by gains in tech stocks.</li>
<li>The funds raised through IPOs in the Americas and EMEA regions rose, 91% and 61% respectively.</li>
<li>The capital raised globally through IPOs recorded a slight downtick on 2023, due mainly to the APAC region which raised the lowest amount in the last five years despite hosting the largest IPO globally, Midea Group.</li>
<li>Though we saw fewer IPOs globally, the average size of an IPO increased by 7.6% compared to 2023, and the number of IPOs raising over USD$1bn more than doubled year on year. In 2023 these IPOs added USD$16.14bn to capital markets, whilst in 2024 they reached USD$36.40bn.</li>
<li>The data shows that overall, the average trading size was at its lowest in the last 5 years, suggesting that more retail investors were active in the market. The Americas bucked this trend, recording its largest average trade size in the last 5 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE commented,</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Investors turn to public markets to finance the future. As we start 2025, it's crucial for new Governments and policymakers worldwide to reaffirm their commitment to keeping these markets dynamic. We need to see policies that not only foster investment in transparent, well-regulated markets, but also empower and encourage businesses to list and access essential capital for growth.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE commented,</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The data reflects the persistence of geopolitical tensions and uncertainty derived from elections. In 2024 we also saw substantive changes in monetary policy around the world. Looking ahead, geopolitical tensions will remain a key driver of capital markets, and determiner of business confidence, IPO activity, and investor sentiment. By the half year, the data should show the impact of US policy developments on market performance globally. Longer-term, the patterns we are starting to see in how technological advancements are impacting market composition and growth, could become starker.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Key data points:</strong><br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>These FX capabilities are now available via 360T&rsquo;s platform, enabling users to deploy them across highly curated disclosed or anonymous liquidity pools, putting multiple counterparties in competition to help ensure best execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to announce this partnership with QB and are confident that providing access to highly sophisticated FX algos from an independent specialist provider, as additional tools alongside the broad range of bank offered algos already available via 360T, will provide significant benefits to our diverse and global client base,&rdquo; said Matt O&rsquo;Hara, CEO of 360T Americas.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;This partnership also delivers on Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s strategic vision to bring together highly complementary technology solutions from independently operating providers within the organisation to create a truly differentiated offering and further accelerate growth, while also fully aligning with 360T&rsquo;s commitment to constant innovation in FX.&rdquo;</p>

<title>The Complex Challenge Of Advice - Speech By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Conexus Financial Professional Planner 2025 Advice Policy Summit, 10 February 2025.</title>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Financial advisers are entrusted by their clients to help them make confident and informed decisions. In many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</span></li>
<li><span>ASIC has observed some positive signs of improvement &ndash; but there continues to be too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers</span>.</li>
<li><span>In light of some of these poor practices, &lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo; and &lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo; have been selected as 2025 enforcement priorities</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning everyone.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal people as the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we are gathering today &ndash; and by paying my respects to their elders past, present and emerging and extending that respect to any First Nations people with us here today.</p>
<p>One of ASIC&rsquo;s core functions is to promote the confident and informed participation of consumers and investors in our financial system &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why I was pleased to accept this invitation to speak at this Advice Policy Summit.</p>
<p>Not everybody needs or seeks advice to support their participation in the financial system. But when they do, it&rsquo;s important that they have access to good quality advice that meets their needs and is delivered with independence and integrity.</p>
<p>While that&rsquo;s a simple objective, achieving it is not easy.</p>
<p>As is clear from ASIC&rsquo;s work over many years, the complexity of the financial system, the range of products and business models, the interconnected nature of some of those, and indeed the range of knowledge and capacity that people bring when they engage with the system, make consumer protection and financial advice a complex challenge.</p>
<p>Sometimes this results in very complex legislation, as I know you&rsquo;re all aware of. And sometimes that is helpful. But we&rsquo;re also increasingly conscious that sometimes it is not.</p>
<p>Complexity can often be an obstacle to compliance, and to effective regulation. In our experience, the simpler a set of rules, the more enforceable they are. That&rsquo;s not just good for consumers and investors. It&rsquo;s also good for businesses and professionals, who get greater clarity about what&rsquo;s required of them.</p>
<p>And while the legislative framework is a matter for the Government, we&lsquo;re conscious that we administer a complex range of regulatory guidance and legislative instruments. With a significant amount of that focusing on the requirements that apply to people involved in the provision of financial advice.</p>
<p>In November last year, our Chair Joe Longo announced the creation of a Simplification Consultative Group, to advise ASIC on what we can do, within our powers, to address this issue of complexity. We will be seeking your views on this work during 2025. So if it&rsquo;s an issue of interest to you, I encourage you to keep an eye out for further announcements in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But returning to the topic of today&rsquo;s forum, advice policy, I&rsquo;d like to start by talking about ASIC&rsquo;s role in policy &ndash; in general and also in relation to the advice-related reforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll then share some reflections on what we are seeing in terms of the quality of advice.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll finish with some notes on what you can expect to see from ASIC over the next year, given our priorities.</p>
<h2>Policy: preparation, implementation and compliance</h2>
<p>So, first to ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to policy.</p>
<p>ASIC doesn&rsquo;t make policy decisions. Nor do we design regulatory reform. That&rsquo;s the role of the Government, guided by advice from Treasury, with Parliament, of course, making the ultimate decision on any changes to legislation.</p>
<p>ASIC does, of course, assist Treasury through that process. But our role really comes into play once legislative reforms have passed, where we&rsquo;ve got an important role in helping industry to understand what the new requirements mean for them, and how to comply with them. And, obviously, a key way in which we do this is through producing regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>The Delivering Better Financial Outcomes (DBFO) reforms provide the most recent examples of this work. As you know, and we&rsquo;ve already talked about this morning, it&rsquo;s being rolled out in a series of tranches. And through this process, we&rsquo;ve been liaising with industry &ndash; through various professional associations, through our supervisory work and stakeholder forums, including our own Financial Adviser Consultative Panel.</p>
<p>Coming from that work, in October and November we released &ndash; following the passage of the first tranche &ndash; a suite of new and updated regulatory guidance and other supporting information. And we continue to seek input from stakeholders on the content of our regulatory guidance, some of which may result in further updates to that guidance. And as further reforms are legislated, we&rsquo;ll continue through that process.</p>
<p>Similarly, with the introduction of professional standards for financial advisers, we continue to update our guidance &ndash; and we&rsquo;ll no doubt be doing that further as a result of some announcements earlier today. This, to date, includes information about the impact of the reforms, timeframes for compliance and the requirements for accessing different pathways.</p>
<p>As reforms begin to take effect, industry participants sometimes encounter practical issues that are raised with us, often by industry groups. We&rsquo;re always really keen to listen to those concerns and, where it&rsquo;s appropriate and within our powers, we&rsquo;re willing to consider taking action to support the intent of the relevant reforms.</p>
<p>As an example, following industry concerns about the practical implications of the changes to Financial Services Guide (FSG) requirements, we registered a legislative instrument late last year, which broadened the use of website disclosure. So that it can be used in relation to dealing in a financial product for the purposes of implementing financial product advice, as well as for the advice itself. And I know that was something that was welcomed by many around the industry.</p>
<p>Of course, once legislation is in place, we also then shift focus to monitoring compliance &ndash; and one of the key ways in which we do that is through thematic reviews.</p>
<p>These typically involve selecting a selection of advisers and licensees, gathering data and information to help us to assess levels of compliance with particular legislative provisions. We then publish our findings, highlighting good practices and areas for improvement to assist the sector and drive further compliance.</p>
<p>And a good example of this from the past year would be Report 779, which examined the role of super trustees, financial advisers and licensees in relation to choice superannuation products &ndash; which I discussed at another Conexus event late last year which I know a number of you were present at [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>].</p>
<p>Then the other key aspect of our role is, of course, enforcement. Where we see serious non-compliance &ndash; which might be something we identify through our thematic reviews, it might be through reportable situations, it might be through reports of misconduct that come directly to us from members of the public &ndash; we may refer that misconduct for investigation, which can, of course, lead to litigation by ASIC or referral to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for potential prosecution.</p>
<p>We provide clear guidance to industry about our priorities, the areas of focus in our enforcement work, through annual enforcement priorities, which I&rsquo;ll discuss a bit later.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s view on the quality of advice</h2>
<p>Before speaking about our priorities for the next year, Conexus invited me to make a few comments about what we&rsquo;re seeing in terms of the quality of advice and whether it&rsquo;s improved, given the reforms of recent years.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, we&rsquo;ve seen some positive indications through work that ASIC has done. That includes the work that we did on the Life Insurance Framework Review, where we saw a significant improvement in the quality of advice between 2017 and 2021.</p>
<p>And although the scope and findings of that work were limited to life insurance advice, some of our observations from the review and input from industry stakeholders suggest that several factors have influenced an improvement in standards of advice in parts of the industry.</p>
<p>They, of course, include the adviser education standards and improved focus by licensees on the best interests duty, and the adoption of some of the recommendations that we made in 2017, following a review of how large institutions were overseeing advisers [<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-515-financial-advice-review-of-how-large-institutions-oversee-their-advisers/" title="REP 515 Financial advice: Review of how large institutions oversee their advisers">REP 515</a>].</p>
<p>We also observed, in that work, that record-keeping across client advice files had materially improved. And that&rsquo;s important because record-keeping helps demonstrate compliance, and it&rsquo;s long been an area of focus for ASIC and will continue to be so.</p>
<h2>Areas of concern</h2>
<p>At the same time, however, we continue to see too many examples where advice leads to poor, if not devastating, outcomes for consumers.</p>
<p>Our ongoing investigation into the Shield Master Fund is one such example &ndash; though regrettably it&rsquo;s not an isolated one. It reflects a pattern of conduct we are seeing all too frequently.</p>
<p>This pattern commonly involves telemarketers recruiting consumers before passing them onto advisers. These advisers then recommend that consumers withdraw their superannuation savings from a regulated fund and invest them, sometimes via an SMSF (self-managed super fund), into a high-risk property scheme or some other high-risk investment.</p>
<p>Our Deputy Chair Sarah Court has described some of this misconduct as occurring &lsquo;at industrial scale&rsquo;. And this can result in the significant erosion &ndash; or complete loss &ndash; of a person&rsquo;s retirement savings. And while there is often a complex web of individuals and entities involved, inappropriate or poor-quality advice typically plays a pivotal role in the ultimate consumer outcomes.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s priorities</h2>
<p>Those comments are a bit of a backdrop to some of our priorities for the current year, which I&rsquo;ll talk about now. I&rsquo;ll talk about our strategic priorities and enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>We have five longer-term&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/what-we-do/our-role/our-vision-and-strategic-priorities/" title="Our vision and strategic priorities">strategic priorities</a>&nbsp;but there are two in particular that I&rsquo;ll call out as having an impact on advice.</p>
<p>The first is to&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;improve consumer outcomes&rsquo;</strong>. And this includes our work in a range of areas, such as predatory sales tactics, design and distribution obligations and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>And I would like to particularly highlight the work on dispute resolution. We, of course, now receive data on a six-monthly basis on firms&rsquo; internal dispute resolution. We have made it clear that we will be publishing firm-level data from that data collection during the course of 2025.</p>
<p>Late last year, we published a higher-level overview of what we were seeing from the initial data collection, with some observations around some of the data quality issues. And, I guess, I mention that because with firm-level publication coming, firms have got an opportunity to really focus on how to improve the quality of their data before that becomes publicly available.</p>
<p>The second strategic priority to highlight is&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;better retirement outcomes and member services&rsquo;</strong>. And while this includes our well-publicised work on member services for members of super funds, our work in this area is not limited to super. It also includes a focus on entities and individuals involved in the provision of advice.</p>
<p>An important initiative in this area is our thematic review into self-managed super fund establishment advice, which is focusing on why some clients are advised to set up an SMSF.</p>
<p>As part of this, we&rsquo;re reviewing client advice files, where SMSF establishment advice was provided, to assess compliance with the best interests duty and related obligations. We&rsquo;re also reviewing information from licensees about their oversight and the application of their policies and procedures in the context of SMSF establishment advice. And I expect that we&rsquo;ll release the findings from this work in the second half of this calendar year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, besides our strategic priorities, we also have&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">enforcement priorities</a>, which are announced annually. And these target specific forms of misconduct that are of serious concern to ASIC.</p>
<p>Over the coming year, you can expect, through those priorities, to see a sustained focus on advice-related misconduct.</p>
<p>In light of some of the poor practices we&rsquo;re seeing, which I&rsquo;ve spoken about, the 2025 priorities include&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;misconduct exploiting superannuation savings&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;unscrupulous property investment schemes&rsquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>And I want to say, our work in this area won&rsquo;t be limited to superannuation trustees or responsible entities of managed investment schemes. It will include the broad range of entities involved in conduct causing harm to consumers and investors &ndash; including advisers and licensees.</p>
<p>And the final thing I want to say is those enforcement priorities are set in a context in which our investment in enforcement and our appetite for taking on significant matters are increasing.</p>
<p>We currently have action underway against NAB, HSBC, the ASX, Harvey Norman, QBE and Rex. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the trial of former directors and officers of the Star Entertainment Group, which is commencing today. The number of investigations that we commenced in the last six months of 2024 was up more than 30%, year-on-year, and some of these will flow through into future litigation and compliance action.</p>
<p>And I really hope that this stronger approach to enforcement is something that&rsquo;s welcomed by people in this room. Because when advice goes terribly wrong, the harm that it causes to consumers can damage confidence in the entire industry.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I wanted to say by way of intro. Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>As I said at the start, one of our core functions is to promote the informed participation of consumers and investors in the system.</p>
<p>Your clients trust you to help them make confident and informed decisions &ndash; and, in many cases, those decisions will be among the most consequential of their lives.</p>
<p>So, I hope that these comments give you confidence that ASIC is committed to continuing to work with you to help you to comply with the law in ways that produce good outcomes for consumers. Thank you.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge funds gained in January to begin 2025 navigating a volatile month highlighted the inauguration of Donald Trump as the US President, confirmation procedures of key appointed Cabinet positions, and a wide range of executive orders implementing policy changes across a number of areas including immigration, trade/tariffs, energy policy and spending reductions. In addition to this, managers also navigated a volatile month in the technology sector, with earnings, capital expenditures and strategic outlooks impacted by intense competition in the AI space driven by the Chinese startup Deepseek.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite gained +1.4 percent for the month, led by the directional HFRI Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +2.1 percent. The HFR Cryptocurrency Index extended its 2024 surge, adding +0.36 percent in January on the favorable outlook for cryptocurrency by the incoming Trump administration. The recently launched HFRI Multi-Manager/Pod Shop Index advanced +1.9 percent for the month as managers navigated policies from the new administration, as well as Technology volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Hedge fund performance dispersion contracted slightly in January, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.9 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 12.0 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in December 2024 was 13.2 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending January 2025, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +41.4 percent, while the bottom decile declined -9.9 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 51.3 percent. Nearly eighty percent (80%) of hedge funds produced positive performance in January.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">HFR unveiled an expansion of its HFRI, HFRI 500 and HFRI 400 index families, launching new indices delineated by fund liquidity. The new composite and strategy-level indices are split into two liquidity categories: one for funds with monthly (or more frequent) liquidity, the other comprised of funds offering less than monthly liquidity (quarterly, etc.). The purpose of the new indices is to empower investors by offering hedge fund benchmarks that more closely resemble the liquidity characteristics of their underlying hedge fund or other alternative asset portfolios.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge continues to lead main strategy performance</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, extended 2024 leadership with a strong gain to begin 2025 while navigating both new policy and technology sector volatility, with the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index advancing +2.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index, which surged +3.6 percent for the month, the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, which jumped +2.8 percent, and the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which added +1.65 percent in January.</span></p>

Despite the volatility, directional Equity Hedge strategies led broad-based strategy gains for the month, with contributions from Fundamental, Quantitative and Shareholder Activist sub-strategy exposures,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;Many financial market risks have shifted and evolved but not fallen, with geopolitical risk shifting from election outcomes and military conflicts to policy changes and conflict resolution; inflation and interest rate risks remain, while expectations for continued growth in AI-fueled large cap technology are in some cases tempered by high capital expenditures and intense global competition. Managers have been positioning for this dynamic environment for several months, with intensive positioning since the US election in November, and it is likely that managers are positioned for acceleration of these policy changes throughout 1H25. Investors are likely to increase allocations to managers which have effectively demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s specialized ability to navigate these policy changes and rapidly shifting market cycles which create both risk and opportunities.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>SEC: Exemption From Exchange Act Rule 13f-2 And Related Form SHO</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-exemption-from-exchange-act-rule-13f-2-and-related-form-sho-202528/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-exemption-from-exchange-act-rule-13f-2-and-related-form-sho-202528/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today provided a temporary exemption from compliance with Rule 13f-2 under the Securities Exchange Act and from reporting on Form SHO. As a result of the exemption, filings on initial Form SHO reports from institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds will be due by Feb. 17, 2026, for the January 2026 reporting period. The effective date for Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO was Jan. 2, 2024, and the compliance date for such rule and form was Jan. 2, 2025, with initial Form SHO filings originally due by Feb. 14, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 requires institutional investment managers that meet or exceed certain specified thresholds to file Form SHO with the Commission within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month with regard to certain equity securities via the Commission&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR). The Commission will publish, on an aggregated basis, certain information regarding each equity security reported by institutional investment managers on Form SHO and filed with the Commission via EDGAR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market,&rdquo; said SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda. &ldquo;This exemption gives filers more time to implement the technical updates required for compliance according to standards that were released only on Dec. 16, 2024, immediately prior to the holidays. Regardless of this exemption, abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful, and the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exemption will provide industry participants sufficient time to work with Commission staff to address any outstanding operational and compliance questions. This exemption will also provide filers sufficient time to complete implementation of system builds and testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency is essential to well-functioning markets. And the Commission has stated the importance of providing more disclosure about short selling. It is also important to enhance the accuracy of the short sale-related data that would ultimately be provided to investors by giving institutional investment managers additional time.</p>
<p>Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO reporting will enhance the transparency of other available short sale-related information. Currently, several self-regulatory organizations (SROs) are providing on their websites daily aggregate short selling volume information for individual equity securities. The SROs are also providing website disclosure on a one-month delayed basis of information regarding individual short sale transactions in all exchange-listed equity securities. Hyperlinks to short sale data&nbsp;provided by specific SROs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/short-sale-volume-and-transaction-data">are available</a>. Further, the SROs are also publishing monthly statistics on short interest in securities that trade on their markets.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/fails-deliver-data">publishes on its website</a>&nbsp;failures to deliver data for all equity securities, regardless of the fails level, twice per month.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the appointment of Rodney E. Hood as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, effective February 10, 2025. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent designated Mr. Hood pursuant to his authority in 12 U.S.C. 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful for the trust of Secretary Bessent and will work diligently to promote a regulatory environment that is effective without being excessive,&rdquo; said Mr. Hood. &ldquo;I remain committed to a balanced framework&mdash;one that fosters innovation, expands financial inclusion, and ensures that all Americans have fair access to the financial services they need to thrive. I look forward to leading the dedicated career staff at the OCC, whose expertise and commitment are essential to maintaining a safe and sound banking system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hood succeeds Acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu, who has served in the role since May 10, 2021.</p>
<p>"I thank Mr. Hsu for his many years of dedicated public service and his commitment to strengthening the resilience of the U.S. banking system," said Mr. Hood.</p>
<p>Mr. Hood was previously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2005 and again in 2019 to serve on the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUA). In 2019, President Donald J.

While at the NCUA, Hood also served as a voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, as the NeighborWorks America Board Chairman, and as Vice Chairman of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.</p>
<p>Before public service, Mr. Hood held senior roles in retail finance, commercial banking, affordable housing, and community development in the private sector.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent today announced his intention to appoint Rodney E. Hood as a Deputy Comptroller and to designate him the First Deputy Comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In this role, Mr. Hood will also serve as Acting Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong leadership and career experience of Rodney Hood will strengthen the OCC&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system while also enhancing economic growth," said Secretary Bessent.</p>

<p>The OCC is a bureau within the Department of the Treasury, and the Comptroller of the Currency is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. By statute (12 U.S.C. &sect; 4), the Treasury Secretary is responsible for appointing up to four Deputy Comptrollers of the Currency and designating one as the First Deputy Comptroller.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jon, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is such a pleasure to be back in Miami, a city I have seen grow and become ever more dynamic over the decades, as I have come many times to visit my large extended family here ever since the 1980s.</p>
<p>As I discussed in my final speech of 2024, two positive supply shocks have significantly benefited the U.S. economy over the past two years and have also affected the conduct of monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The first of these has been the surge in population over the past few years that has helped bring labor supply into balance with labor demand and, thus, also helped move inflation toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. The other positive supply shock, which I outlined in my remarks in December, has been a step-up in aggregate productivity growth since 2020, which is an increase in the amount of economic output, across the economy, per hour worked or some other unit of labor. Although productivity growth, measured quarterly, can be quite volatile, over the past five years this acceleration is quite evident. While productivity grew by about 1.5 percent a year from 2005 to 2019, starting in 2020 it has grown about 2 percent a year. This difference may not look dramatic, but because of compounding year-over-year, the consequences of an additional 1/2 percentage point in growth over the past five years are significant for workers and the U.S. economy. When workers are more productive, it effectively means that businesses can produce more without needing to add workers, and that they can pay workers more without needing to raise prices. When they are more productive, it can also serve as an incentive for businesses to expand. Across the economy, higher productivity growth means that real wages and living standards for workers can rise faster without putting upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what has been happening recently, a period when inflation has been falling while the economy is expanding. While fast growth in wages was one of the factors driving inflation in 2021 and 2022, most likely some of that increase was due to productivity growth and, hence, was not inflationary. If productivity continues to grow at an accelerated pace, it would support the FOMC's efforts to keep unemployment low and return inflation to a sustained level of 2 percent. For that reason, I would like to spend the balance of my remarks exploring some of the possible reasons why productivity has accelerated, and the prospects that this fortunate development will continue.</p>
<p>Numerous factors affect aggregate productivity, and several may have driven the increase in productivity growth in the U.S. since the pandemic, in contrast to the subdued productivity growth experienced by other advanced economies around the world.</p>
<p>One such factor may have been a result of the enormous movement of workers caused by the pandemic. It began with the dramatic loss of 22 million jobs in the spring of 2020, the reemployment of many of those workers and the continued mobility as people quit jobs, switched occupations and careers, and relocated in response to the enormous changes in work and home life brought about by the pandemic. In finding new jobs, in what became a very tight labor market, workers had the opportunity to find better matches for their skills and, to some extent, work that they were motivated to carry out and which made them more productive. One indication that this was probably a significant factor in the U.S. is that other advanced economies where there was less worker movement have experienced lower rates of productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Economic data and research suggest that periods of strong job re-allocation are accompanied or followed by higher productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>The tightness of the labor market since 2021 has also likely led firms to invest to a greater extent in labor-saving as well as labor-enhancing technologies, which, of course, is traditionally one of the major sources of productivity gains. For example, many retail businesses seemed to have installed more self-checkout machines after the onset of the pandemic, allowing employers to substitute capital for workers when workers could not come to work in person and when there were severe shortages. More generally, digital technology allowed employees to continue working from home during the period of the pandemic and beyond, saving commuting time and making employees potentially more productive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>To the extent that these factors are boosting productivity growth, they are by their nature one-off developments that eventually will fade. A notable exception may turn out to be productivity improvements from investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI investment by businesses has stepped up in the past two years, and it appears to be accelerating.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The advent of the internet and related innovations boosted productivity growth for about 10 years starting in the mid-1990s, and the benefits of AI could potentially be that revolutionary and persistent.</p>
<p>In addition to being temporary, the factors that I have outlined that could be boosting productivity, job re-allocation, and technological investments are themselves hard to measure across the economy. And so are their effects on productivity as well. But there is another important factor that is likely to be driving productivity higher whose effects may well persist, and that is the surge in new business formation experienced since 2019. As I will explain, new businesses are associated with higher rates of overall productivity growth, and that may be particularly true for some of the sectors in which these businesses were created.</p>
<p>Applications for new business tax identification numbers jumped shortly after the pandemic began and have remained elevated since then.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In 2024, the pace of applications that are likely to result in employer business formation was about 30 percent above its 2019 pace. This surge is largely unique to the U.S. In the euro zone, for example, business registrations have been relatively flat. This may help explain why labor productivity growth in Europe has been well below that of the U.S. in recent years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The surge in applications in early 2020 was an early signal of an acceleration in the creation of job-creating new firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The latest data available indicate that new firms created 1.9 million jobs in 2023, 14 percent higher than the total for 2019.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A couple of aspects of this surge in business entry in the U.S. are noteworthy. First, the surge was particularly noticeable in high-tech industries that, historically, are important for overall innovation and productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Second, while the pace of business applications has cooled somewhat over the past year, it still remains elevated and well above pre-pandemic norms. It is, in fact, proving somewhat more persistent than some expected.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the surge in new business formation is highly relevant to our discussion about productivity. There is a large body of research that finds that new firms are key contributors to innovation and growth in aggregate productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a><span>&nbsp;</span>This might seem surprising and counterintuitive, since it is well known that many new firms fail in their first year or two. But in the commotion of competition that these many new businesses face, there are always businesses that persist and keep their lights on, and those often do so because they are innovative and more productive. New businesses are the essence of the competition that drives market-based economies, and it is not surprising that they would be an important source of new products or processes for doing business&mdash;and a source of growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Of course, not every new firm has to innovate and grow to make important economic contributions. Every entrepreneur contributes even if they just create a job for themselves and their family members. But those new firms that do innovate and grow are critical for improvements in overall productivity over time.</p>
<p>As I noted before, since the surge in entrepreneurship after the onset of the pandemic featured an increase in high-tech businesses as well, the productivity implications could be significant. Indeed, the last period of strong productivity growth in the U.S., which ran from the late 1990s into the early 2000s, was preceded by a surge of new business creation in high-tech industries, including those industries that more recently have been associated with AI-related developments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;So this is one source of my optimism about continued robust productivity growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>But it is not only the innovations produced directly by new businesses that are important, since by any measure these new firms are a small share of total businesses. New businesses also help drive innovation by existing firms. As they scramble for funding, customers, and human capital, new businesses will increase competition with existing ones, forcing them to innovate as well so they can succeed. This is surely also driving the recent acceleration in productivity growth.</p>
<p>Many predicted that the surge in new business creation would disappear as effects of the pandemic have faded, but this has not really happened. It is possible that the surge in entry will recede and that its productivity effects will likewise be temporary. On the other hand, the productivity gains from a surge in entry could last for some time, since these highly productive young firms have been found to grow rapidly for several years, contributing to aggregate productivity growth along the way. Time will tell, but for now, it seems likely that this is a factor supporting productivity growth at a higher-than-historical rate.</p>
<p>I will confess to you all that it is not a coincidence that I have come to Miami to highlight the role of entrepreneurship in innovation and productivity growth. Miami and the Miami metropolitan area is an extraordinarily entrepreneurial area, a place with high rates of new business creation, and it is likely an important source of the recent productivity surge.</p>
<p>Out of more than 900 U.S. cities for which we have data, Miami's post-pandemic new firm entry rate ranked 8th in the nation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;And Miami is not alone in Florida; 5 of the top 20 cities for pandemic-era business formation are here in your state.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Miami specifically, and Florida generally, has been a key part of the U.S. entrepreneurship story for some time. During the decade before the pandemic, Miami ranked 5th out of more than 900 U.S. cities for firm entry rates, and Florida featured 8 of the top 20 U.S. cities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Miami is special in this regard. I wonder what is in the water here to produce such a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture. Perhaps it is the extent of sunshine, which has long been associated with optimism. Perhaps it is the friendly economic climate&mdash;in my own academic research, I have found that policies that facilitate business entry and support worker or job re-allocation are indeed helpful for dynamism and productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;But an interesting question for me as the first Hispanic at the Board of Governors since its creation is whether the large Hispanic population in Florida is also a factor behind the impressive pace of business dynamism that I have just described.</p>
<p>More than 25 percent of Florida's population is Hispanic, compared with around 20 percent for the United States as a whole.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Nationwide, recent data indicate that Latinos account for a dominant&mdash;and rapidly growing&mdash;share of new entrepreneurship in the U.S., with a particular increase since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Of course, many of these Latino entrepreneurs are also immigrants, another group with a well-known proclivity for entrepreneurship.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250207a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;There are immigrants in Miami from the Caribbean and all over the world who contribute to the entrepreneurial culture of this city, and it is surely this culture, as much as the efforts of any nationality or group, that is the real engine of the dynamism here. I applaud you all for fostering that culture here in Florida, which is such an important contributor to the economic growth of our nation. More entrepreneurs means more productivity, which is crucial to U.S. prosperity.</p>
<p>Let me conclude with an outline of my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and the FOMC's efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a strong labor market.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy remains on a firm footing.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) continues to grow at a solid pace. The Bureau for Economic Analysis estimates that real GDP grew 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024, and private domestic final purchases, which is the best indicator for GDP one quarter ahead, grew a solid 3.2 percent. Therefore, I anticipate solid GDP growth also in the first quarter of this year. In addition, earlier today the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers created 143,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged down to 4 percent, consistent with a healthy labor market that is neither weakening nor showing signs of overheating.</p>
<p>Inflation has fallen significantly since its peak in the middle of 2022, and in September the FOMC judged that it was time to begin reducing our policy interest rate from levels intended to strongly restrict aggregate demand and put downward pressure on inflation. We reduced our policy rate 100 basis points through December, but the recent progress on inflation has been slow and uneven, and inflation remains elevated. There is also considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of proposals of new policies. Going forward, in considering the appropriate federal funds rate, we will watch these developments closely and continue to carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
