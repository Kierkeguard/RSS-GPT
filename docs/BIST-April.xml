<div> regulators, transaction reporting, Earth's rotation, timekeeping systems, UTC adjustment
Summary:<br>The financial regulators are evaluating if regulations on transaction reporting and clock synchronization need revisions due to Earth's rotation impact on UTC. Concerns arise over possible market abuse judgments. <br><br>Summary: <div>
<p>Major financial regulators are set to hold an urgent virtual meeting today, April 1, to evaluate if existing regulations on transaction reporting, order record-keeping, and clock synchronisation need revisions in light of climate change's impacts on Earth's rotation and timekeeping systems.</p>
<p>Trading venues and participants must align their business clocks with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to the millisecond or finer for recording reportable events. This synchronisation is crucial for accuracy in timestamping events sent to the central repository.</p>
<p>Recent scientific findings highlight global warming's significant effect on Earth's rotation speed, necessitating periodic adjustments to UTC. These adjustments ensure atomic clocks, which are far more precise, remain in sync with the slight variations in Earth's rotation and prevent the discrepancy in day length from increasing.</p>
<p>A recent study in the journal Nature attributes the accelerating melting of polar ice due to human activities as a new contributing factor to these distortions, effectively slowing Earth's spin and impacting our timekeeping adjustments.</p>
<p>Historically, to match the day's length with atomic time, leap seconds were added when Earth's rotation lagged behind caesium clocks. For instance, in 1972, the "rotation day" extended 0.025 seconds longer than the "atomic day", leading to a cumulative 0.7 seconds delay over a year. This delay was corrected by incorporating an extra second at the year's end. Such adjustments were standard until recent shifts in Earth's interior began to speed up its rotation, suggesting the possible need to subtract a leap second in 2026 for the first time.</p>
<p>This potential change in UTC adjustment raises concerns among regulators about the implications for market abuse judgments, which legal experts could challenge.</p>
<p>Avril Feuilherade, spokesperson for the Council of Regulators, emphasised, "Timing is everything."</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Requires Regulatory Clearance On The Appointment Of Mr. Cao Shixuan, Former Director Of ecoWise Holdings Limited</title>

<div> audit, transactions, non-compliance, SGX RegCo, EY

Summary:
SGX RegCo directed ecoWise to commission audits and appointed special auditor EY. EY's report highlighted transactions concerns, non-compliance, and actions to be taken. SGX RegCo will require ecoWise to provide a satisfactory trading resumption proposal and will investigate potential listing rule breaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) refers to the Notice of Compliance issued to ecoWise Holdings Limited on 25 June 2021 and the company&rsquo;s announcement dated 28 March 2024 on the findings of the special audit by the special auditor, Ernst &amp; Young Advisory Pte Ltd (&ldquo;EY&rdquo;). EY reports the findings directly to SGX RegCo and the company&rsquo;s relevant sponsors during the relevant period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Background&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On 14 June 2021, the company announced the group&rsquo;s financial results for the half-year ended 30 April 2021 (&ldquo;1HFY2021 Results&rdquo;). The announcement indicated that the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, Mr. Lee Thiam Seng (&ldquo;Mr. Lee&rdquo;) did not agree to the release of the 1HFY2021 Results and therefore, did not provide his confirmation on the accuracy of the financial statements as required under the Listing Rules. SGX RegCo queried the company on the announcement on the same day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 June 2021, the company requested for a trading halt (which was subsequently converted into a trading suspension) as the directors could not unanimously agree and finalise their response to SGX RegCo. The company subsequently announced on 25 June 2021, among others, that Mr. Lee had concerns over certain transactions and their impact on the group&rsquo;s 1HFY2021 Results due to insufficient information provided to him by the finance team.</p>
<p>In light of the above developments, SGX RegCo directed the company, among others, to (i) commission its statutory auditor from RSM Chio Lim LLP (&ldquo;RSM Chio Lim&rdquo;) to perform an audit of its 1HFY2021 Results and (ii) appoint a suitable independent special auditor to look into the transactions raised by Mr. Lee, and the corporate governance of the group. EY was appointed as the special auditor on 27 August 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RSM Chio Lim&rsquo;s audit findings suggested that the group had PRC-incorporated subsidiaries that were not consolidated with the group and there were transactions between the group and an entity called Hong Kong Chen Bang Investments Ltd (&ldquo;HK Chen Bang&rdquo;), purportedly associated with the Group&rsquo;s former Executive Director and Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Cao Shixuan (&ldquo;Mr. Cao&rdquo;). EY was therefore directed by SGX RegCo to expand the scope of the special audit to include transactions undertaken by the unconsolidated entities as well as with HK Chen Bang (the &ldquo;Expanded Scope&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span>Findings from EY&rsquo;s Special Audit Report</span></p>
<p><span>Transactions raised by Mr. Lee</span></p>
<p>The transactions which Mr. Lee had concerns on were: (a) arbitration with China Hua Dian Engineering Co., Ltd, (b) liquidation of China-UK Low Carbon Enterprise Co., Ltd, an entity which the company had an indirect 20% equity interest in, and (c) disposal of Saiko Rubber (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and the use of disposal proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EY did not observe any irregularities in these transactions, aside from the non-disclosure of key milestones relating to the arbitration with China Hua Dian. Certain key matters of these transactions were either not reported to the board of directors, or updates to the board of directors were unclear or inaccurate. EY further observed that ecoWise&rsquo;s board apparently relied on the former sponsors to advise on matters that require announcements. However, as the former sponsors were not always made aware of developments within the company, they were unable to advise the company accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Transactions under the Expanded Scope</span></p>
<p>The transactions covered under the Expanded Scope included the review of the transactions undertaken by the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries and the group&rsquo;s transactions with HK Chen Bang which took place primarily in PRC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Available documents showed that Mr. Cao was the legal representative and/or the executive director of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries, and his role was to oversee the Company&rsquo;s operations in the PRC. The transactions under the Expanded Scope were primarily handled by Mr. Cao. EY reported that they were unable to obtain clarity on those transactions due to the lack of comprehensive records maintained by the group and Mr. Cao also did not accede to EY&rsquo;s request for information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Instances of non-compliance&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>EY reported certain key controls lapses, such as when payment amounts were split to circumvent the existing payment approval matrix to supposedly expedite the payment process, record keeping on payments was poor, lack of policies on matters that require company announcement, and matters that should be escalated to the board of directors.</p>
<p>EY also highlighted potential listing rule breaches relating to the non-disclosure of the group&rsquo;s ongoing arbitration with China Hua Dian and the existence of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries, internal control lapses, as well as potential contravention of Section 160 of the Companies Act in relation to the failure to obtain company&rsquo;s approval for the disposal of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Actions by SGX RegCo</span></p>
<p>Mr. Cao was involved in the transactions under the Expanded Scope and did not attend the interviews arranged by EY. He also failed to provide further information to EY on the transactions, when requested. Consequently, EY was unable to conduct a thorough examination of the transactions. In light of his failure to extend cooperation, Mr. Cao will be placed on our Directors&rsquo; and Executive Officers&rsquo; Watchlist. Issuers who intend to appoint him must seek the views and guidance of SGX RegCo before any proposed appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will require ecoWise to provide a satisfactory trading resumption proposal that include, among others, the following: (a) a clean audit opinion for the latest set of financial statements, (b) a viable and sustainable business, (c) demonstration of its ability to operate as a going concern, (d) assessment and confirmations by the Board and sponsor on the adequacy of working capital for at least 12 months following trading resumption and (e) an independent attestation on the effectiveness and adequacy of its internal controls, which takes into account EY&rsquo;s recommendations (where still relevant) and its operating environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will investigate the potential listing rule breaches highlighted in the EY Report and refer any potential contraventions of the law to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Launches COSMIC Platform To Strengthen The Financial System’s Defence Against Money Laundering And Terrorism Financing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> launch, COSMIC, financial institutions, money laundering, terrorism financing<br />
Summary:<br />
MAS launched COSMIC, a platform for FIs to share customer info to combat financial crimes. Collaboration with major banks to safeguard against criminal behavior. <div>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today launched COSMIC&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-launches-cosmic-platform#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;, the first centralised digital platform to facilitate sharing of customer information among financial institutions (FIs) to combat money laundering (ML), terrorism financing (TF) and proliferation financing (PF)&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-launches-cosmic-platform#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;globally. The Financial Services and Markets (Amendment) Act 2023 and accompanying subsidiary legislation, which set out the legal basis and safeguards for such sharing, commenced on the same day.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Following public consultation in October 2021, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (FSMA) was amended in May 2023 to set out the legislative framework for COSMIC. A COSMIC participant FI may share customer information with another participant FI only if the customer&rsquo;s profile or behaviour displays certain objectively-defined indicators of suspicion, or &ldquo;red flags&rdquo;. The FSMA requires participant FIs to have in place policies and operational safeguards to protect the confidentiality of information shared. This will allow participant FIs to share information on potential criminal behaviour while safeguarding the interests of the vast majority of customers who are legitimate. Customers are encouraged to continue to provide timely responses if requested by FIs to provide clarifications on their risk profiles or transactions, so that FIs can make informed risk assessments.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>COSMIC was co-developed by MAS and six major commercial banks in Singapore - DBS, OCBC, UOB, Citibank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank. These banks will be the participant FIs on COSMIC during its initial phase. Information sharing is currently voluntary and focused on three key financial crime risks in commercial banking, namely: (a) misuse of legal persons; (b) misuse of trade finance for illicit purposes; and (c) proliferation financing.</p>
<p>4<span> </span>Ms Loo Siew Yee, Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments &amp; Financial Crime), MAS, said, &ldquo;COSMIC will enable FIs to warn each other of suspicious activities and make more informed risk assessments on a timely basis. It complements the industry&rsquo;s existing close collaboration with MAS and law enforcement authorities to combat financial crime. This will strengthen Singapore&rsquo;s capabilities to uphold our reputation as a well-regulated and trusted financial centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>***</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Saudi Exchange has hit a milestone of 400 listed securities</li>
<li>In 2023, IPOs on the Saudi Exchange accounted for over 70% of GCC IPOs, with a robust pipeline supporting the Exchange&rsquo;s accelerated growth to become one of the top 10 largest exchanges globally according to the World Federation of Exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Saudi Exchange has welcomed its 400th listing across all securities. This achievement highlights the Exchange&rsquo;s pivotal role in the Kingdom&rsquo;s economy, underpinned by robust international investor interest and a diverse range of securities within a highly dynamic market landscape.</p>
<p>Since its establishment 16 years ago, the Saudi Exchange has quickly grown to become one of the top ten largest in the world, the third largest amongst emerging market peers, and the largest exchange in the MENA region. The Saudi Exchange also consistently ranks in the top ten exchanges globally for IPO proceeds and accounted for over 70% of GCC IPOs in 2023. With a substantial SAR 11.9 billion ($3.2 billion) raised through IPOs on the Main Market in 2023, the Saudi Exchange has firmly established itself as a significant contributor to the global IPO landscape, a key driver of its continued growth in scope and scale. In 2023, furthermore, the Tadawul All Share Index grew by 14.2%, outpacing the 9.8% growth of the benchmark MSCI Emerging Market Index.</p>
<p>With a commitment to offering a broad spectrum of financial instruments, the Saudi Exchange has successfully cultivated a diverse portfolio. As of March 27th 2024, the Saudi Exchange has 216 securities listed on the Main Market, 83 on the Nomu &ndash; Parallel Market, 71 Sukuk &amp; Bonds, 19 REITs, 9 ETFs and 2 CEFs.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Nasser Al Ajaji, Chief of Listing, said, &ldquo;The 400th listed security on the Saudi Exchange marks a significant milestone and is a clear testament to the Kingdom's dynamic capital market and its growing appeal to investors globally. In only 16 years, the Saudi Exchange has grown rapidly to rank among the top ten stock exchanges in the world. These achievements are more than just a number; they are symbolic of the economic diversity and growth spurred by Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the Financial Sector Development Program, and the support of the CMA to accelerate the IPO pipeline. All of this reflects the potential we are poised to realize."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Saudi Exchange is dedicated to enhancing the Kingdom&rsquo;s capital market infrastructure, diversifying product and service offerings, and continuing to provide opportunities that support the economic ambitions of Saudi Arabia and its participants.</p>

After that, the ASE has conducted its screening process for all listed companies based on the criteria used by the ASE represented by full market capitalization of the companies and the number of trading days during last quarter.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Mr. Wathaifi added that as a result of this review, 6 companies have been excluded from the general index sample ASEGI and other 5 companies have been added.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the process, the ASE calculated the free float for all listed companies on the ASE based on the data received from the Securities Depository Center. This review also includes the reduction of the weights for some companies to maintain the 10% cap that applied to index constitutes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Regarding the general index ASEGI, Mr. Wathaifi clarified that the full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 91.0% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE. The free float market capitalization of the index constitutes represents 93.8% of the total free float market capitalization of the listed companies on the ASE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
