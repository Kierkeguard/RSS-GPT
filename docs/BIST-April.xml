<div> AI, governance, regulation, financial markets, transparency 
Summary:
CFTC Commissioner advocates for oversight of AI in financial markets, including surveys, new guidance, and inter-agency task force. Calls for transparency and responsible use. <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p>Good morning. I must thank Charlton McIlwain, Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement at New York University, Director of NYU Alliance for Public Interest Technology, and former President of Data &amp; Society as well as Margaret Hu, Taylor Reveley Research Professor and Professor of Law and Director of the Digital Democracy Lab at William &amp; Mary Law School and Faculty Affiliate with the Global Research Institute and Data Science.</p>
<p>We are grateful to each of you and the New York University Center for Critical Race and Digital Studies, the New York University Alliance for Public Interest Technology, New America Public Interest Technology University Network and the William &amp; Mary Law School Digital Democracy Lab as well as Oxford University Press AI in Society: Oxford Intersections.</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to join you this morning for the opening keynote and fireside chat. The theme for today&rsquo;s conference rightly outlines the challenge for those of us tasked with creating, implementing, and enforcing law and regulation: AI Visioning the Future of Rights in AI Governance. I am a Commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) where I also sponsor the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC). The remarks that I will offer this morning are my own.</p>
<p><span>MRAC Adopts AI Working Plan</span></p>
<p>I join you this morning on the heels of two convenings of the MRAC. Several weeks ago, on March 15, 2024, a Subcommittee of the MRAC voted to approve a working plan for advancing the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of market integration of AI. Yesterday, the MRAC adopted this working plan.</p>
<p>The Subcommittee introduced to the MRAC for consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>A Survey on the Use of AI in CFTC-regulated Markets</span><span>. The Subcommittee believes that it may be useful for the Commission to conduct a survey of CFTC registrants&rsquo; use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets, including possibly integrating the survey in the examinations and other oversight and monitoring tools of the Commission. The survey would be designed to inform the Commission and its staff on how different types of AI are being integrated and details regarding relevant risks and risk mitigation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson12?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></li>
<li><span>Recommendations on New Guidance, Advisories or Rulemaking</span>. The Subcommittee may advance a recommendation that the staff should consider new guidance, advisories or formal rulemaking, based on how CFTC market participants are using AI to conduct regulated activities and any gaps identified in existing regulations and guidance. Areas of focus may include, without limitation, framing the risk of AI models; robust monitoring and testing of AI models, including to address cybersecurity, data controls, bias, privacy, and output consistency; and oversight of AI models.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>We will work to improve and refine the working plan in the coming months. In the interim, allow me to focus on some of my reflections from my work as an academic&mdash;a tenured faculty member researching and publishing on financial markets and AI in financial markets for over decade&mdash;and in my current role as a CFTC Commissioner.</p>
<p>As I noted yesterday, for many years, I have demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to researching and proposing regulatory solutions to challenges presented by integrating AI in our society. Five years ago, I began to convene and participate in convenings of AI developers, adopters, academics, government and industry researchers, regulators, and public interest organizations. In 2020, a co-author and I received invitations to publish two books, one of which examines the ethical implications of AI across diverse sectors of our society.</p>
<p>Recently on a trip to Southern Africa, where I was invited to deliver keynote remarks at a conference on emerging technologies organized by the South African Reserve Bank, I recognized that many of the challenges that arise in the introduction of AI in one jurisdiction are present in other jurisdictions. My remarks addressed the regulation of novel financial products as well as the rapid development and deployment of generative AI and its impact on financial markets. Three weeks ago, at Japanese Fintech Week in Tokyo, Japan, I advocated for the CFTC to begin to identify best practices for integrating AI in our markets.</p>
<p>While the use of AI in financial markets may hold the potential for substantial benefits, such use may also introduce unprecedented risks concerning market integrity, customer protection, governance, data privacy, bias, and cyber threats.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson12?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The CFTC is exploring answers to these and many other questions.</p>
<p>I have advocated for interventions that foster responsible use of AI in financial markets, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p><span>Greater Transparency and Visibility</span></p>
<p>Echoing the MRAC Subcommittee, I have encouraged greater visibility and transparency regarding our registrants&rsquo; use of AI by expanding our annual systems examination questionnaire to incorporate questions that directly inquire about the adoption of AI and related risks.</p>
<p><span>Principles-Based Framework</span></p>
<p>Additionally, I have proposed the development of a principles-based framework. In consultation with members of the Subcommittee of the MRAC, I look forward to exploring a principles-based regulatory framework that underscores intelligibility, risk management, compliance, oversight, market responsibility, notice, and explainability.</p>
<p><strong>Heightened Penalties for Intentional Use of AI to Engage in Fraud or Market Manipulation</strong></p>
<p>Further, I have advocated for the Commission to consider introducing heightened penalties for those who intentionally use AI technologies to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or the evasion of our regulations.</p>
<p><span>An Inter-Agency Task Force on AI</span></p>
<p>Finally, the Commission should lead in creating an inter-agency task force focused on information sharing and composed of<span>&nbsp;</span>market and prudential regulators including the CFTC, SEC, Federal Reserve System, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FHFA, and NCUA. The task force would support the AI Safety Institute in developing guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for the use and regulation of AI in the financial services industry. It may also provide recommendations to the AI Safety Institute as well as evaluate proposals coming out of the Institute.</p>
<p>With sincerest gratitude, I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the organizers of today&rsquo;s convening. I am looking forward to the presentations and discussions today.</p>

<div> Future of Power Markets, Legislation, Inflation Reduction Act, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Carbon Credits<br />
Summary: President Biden's legislation supports clean energy investments, grid reliability, and carbon-neutral power sources, creating market opportunities for carbon credits and energy-efficient technologies. <div>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Good morning everyone, and thank you Commissioner Mersinger, Committee Secretary Lauren Fulks, Alternate Secretaries JonMarc Buffa and Lillian Cardona, and the members of EEMAC who are so gracious to be here today to build on the work from the EEMAC Meeting in February.</p>
<p>Future of Power Markets</p>
<p>The agenda today includes many critical topics, including the future of power markets and the path to attaining net zero carbon in the U.S.</p>
<p>Legislation implemented under the direction of President Biden, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), has drastically improved the incentives to invest in energy markets. Under the IIJA, the federal government has awarded billions of dollars to promote grid reliability, resiliency, and energy efficiency.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement041024#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;As the Biden Administration has reported, in the year following the passage of the IRA, &ldquo;[c]ompanies have announced more than $110 billion in new clean energy manufacturing investments, including more than $70 billion in the EV supply chain and more than $10 billion in solar manufacturing.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement041024#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Growing demand for electric vehicles, coupled with the growth of energy-intensive AI data centers, is leading to an increased need for electricity to power these new technologies. We must ensure that our infrastructure can grow along with new demand, while still allowing us to reach our sustainability goals, including net zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>These developments also come as new environmental markets are forming, such as the market for carbon credits and their derivatives. Carbon credits are a novel way to incentivize parties to reduce their carbon emissions. Because the Commodity Exchange Act tasks the CFTC with enforcing against fraud and market manipulation, the CFTC must act to deter fraud and&nbsp;ensure market integrity. The Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, which I sponsor, is tackling these issues.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Addressing climate-related market risk, and transitioning to carbon-neutral power sources, is going to take a whole-of-government, and whole-of-society approach, and I look forward to hearing today about how members of EEMAC can help advance this critical aim.</p>

- Recognition of EEMAC staff and members<br /><br />Summary: Kansas City hosts AgCon at University of Missouri-Kansas City, highlighting Thomas Hart Benton's art and CFTC's role in protecting Midwest interests. Panels cover crude oil derivatives, electric power, and Basel III implementation. Recognition of EEMAC staff and members. <div>
<p>Welcome to Kansas City, Missouri. First, I would like to thank our hosts at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I am also glad that we could have this meeting in conjunction with AgCon, and I want to thank the Chairman for continuing the tradition of holding AgCon here in the Kansas City area. I am looking forward to the conference and I hope that you all can stay for it as well.</p>
<p>Sinclair Lewis, the first American novelist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, observed that every state has its &ldquo;historical treasures, small, precious, and mislaid.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The same may be said about this city which boldly calls itself, &ldquo;Paris on the Plains.&rdquo; Here in Kansas City, Missouri, the life and art of Thomas Hart Benton is one of those mislaid treasures.</p>
<p>In 1934, Thomas Hart Benton became the first American painter to appear on the cover of Time Magazine as the leading proponent of a new style of painting called American Regionalism.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Today, you might not know who Benton was, but if you don&rsquo;t, you surely know his regionalist colleague Grant Wood and Wood&rsquo;s famous painting,&nbsp;<i>American Gothic</i>.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In the 1930s, Grant Wood from Iowa, John Steuart Curry from Kansas, and Thomas Hart Benton from Missouri made up what was called the &ldquo;American Regionalist Triumvirate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;They all studied and lived for periods of time outside the Midwest, but as Wood said in defense of their travels, &ldquo;I had to go to France to appreciate Iowa.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;They fought nationally and internationally for the idea that in an art world dominated by Paris and New York, there was a place for artists who lived, worked, and depicted American subjects like Wood&rsquo;s pitchfork-holding Iowa farmer and his daughter.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Among our financial regulatory peers, I like to think of the CFTC as taking a similar path. In an industry dominated by large cities and financial concerns, the CFTC was created to protect and give a voice to people who live in places like Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri (not to mention my home State of South Dakota) in major financial hubs and among global regulators.</p>
<p>Like the CFTC, Benton also straddled several different worlds. He was born in the small town of Neosho, Missouri, in 1889, but after his father was elected to Congress, he spent his early years moving back and forth between Missouri and Washington, DC, before being placed in a military academy in anticipation of a future career in politics.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;After disappointing his family by becoming an artist instead of a politician, Benton studied in Chicago and Paris before achieving his long-desired success in New York.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Then in 1935, he did something truly radical. He left New York for Missouri and returned home to teach at the Kansas City Art Institute where he remained until his death in 1975.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Thomas Hart Benton&rsquo;s art focused on the everyday people and moments in life across America, a focus we are striving to achieve through the work of this advisory committee as well.</p>
<p>One of our panels will examine the current state of the crude oil derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Painting in the 1920s and 30s, oil was a subject that fascinated Benton. In 1928, he traveled to Borger, Texas, to see the spectacle of a town and industry quickly cropping up around the discovery of crude oil.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;From that trip came his painting,&nbsp;<i>Boomtown</i>, which in his memoir,&nbsp;<i>An Artist in America</i>, Benton described by saying: &ldquo;Out on the open plain beyond the town a great thick column of black smoke rose as in a volcanic eruption from the earth to the middle of the sky.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Today we will also learn about the construction of our electric grid and the costs of large-scale electrification, which will further inform our work on derivatives markets for electric power.</p>
<p>Electric power was also a subject of interest for Benton. In his mural&nbsp;<i>Instruments of Power</i>, which is currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he depicts everything from power plants and hydroelectric dams to high tension wires and gas turbines.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Also, after EEMAC&rsquo;s discussion of the proposed Basel III Endgame at our last meeting, a Committee member requested that we devote a panel to some different views on the implementation of Basel III. To that end, we have a panel that discusses the Endgame, but from a different perspective that is more supportive of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s current proposal. As I have said previously, we should not shy away from discussing difficult issues where viewpoints differ. We are all better informed when we understand and appreciate all sides of an issue.</p>
<p>Sadly, few painters have taken the time to depict the intricacies of bank capital standards, and even Thomas Hart Benton shied away from the subject. That said, when his father served in Congress, he was a populist in the tradition of William Jennings Bryan and an ardent opponent of large banks and industrialists, so he may have been sympathetic to our Endgame panelist&rsquo;s point of view.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement041024#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>In addition, we will receive further progress reports on our subcommittees from Professor Ian Lange, the Chair of EEMAC&rsquo;s Role of Metals Markets in Transitional Energy Subcommittee and Professor Timothy Fitzgerald, the Chair of EEMAC&rsquo;s Physical Energy Infrastructure Subcommittee.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I also want to recognize EEMAC&rsquo;s own triumvirate of dedicated staff &ndash; Secretary Lauren Fulks and Assistant Secretaries, Lillian Cardona and JonMarc Buffa &ndash; as well as EEMAC Chair, Dena Wiggins and to recognize our newest Associate Member, Annette Hugh from S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.</p>
<p>Thank you to our members, associate members, and guests for attending today. I look forward to another informative meeting.</p>

<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) joins other financial regulators to lend full support for the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0 (Charter 2.0) launched today by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) (Note 1).</p>
<p>The new charter has expanded its scope through the participation of more institutions and merchants, with an aim to help the public safeguard their key personal data against scams and phishing messages sent by impersonators of financial institutions and merchants. Such data include information about personal investment, bank, credit card, insurance and mandatory provident fund (MPF) accounts, etc (Note 2). The SFC is pleased that 83 SFC-licensed corporations covering more than 80% of all active clients have already signed up to the new charter (Note 3).</p>
<p>Participating institutions commit that they will not send customers any instant electronic messages with embedded hyperlinks or request key personal data. They also pledge to provide their own contact information through proper channels for customers to make enquiries, and to promote anti-scam messages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong support our licensed corporations are pledging to the cause shows the determination of our industry leaders to stamp out investment scams and frauds,&rdquo; said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;We hope that securities clients be vigilant and do not fall prey to text messages sent by fraudsters impersonating as their brokers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, over 200 financial institutions and merchants participate in Charter 2.0. They span a broader range of sectors related to the public&rsquo;s daily lives, including banking, insurance, MPF, securities and futures industries, food and beverage, and retail (Note 4).

<div> enhancements, platform, margin analytics, stress testing, hedge funds
Summary:
Cassini introduces platform enhancements for hedge funds, offering advanced margin analytics and stress testing to prepare for future market events.
<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>In a further leap for hedge funds,&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=56869963&amp;msgid=624661&amp;act=Y0K1&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4489821&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fcassini.com%2F&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=4a8506cc17f12704b242cf9b5750a40fb01efd0fa67e3e1d3bff2a24e3f3ab49" target="_blank"><span>Cassini</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;today announces enhancements to its platform. As the leading provider of front-to-back margin and collateral analytics and optimization tools for derivatives and prime brokerage (PB) clients, Cassini&rsquo;s latest advancements considerably expand its capability to replicate PB margin across a diverse array of policy types. Additionally, it is introducing an innovative stress testing feature that fortifies hedge funds against forced liquidation events, thus contributing to the robustness of their risk frameworks.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Historically, only firms with access to complex and costly internal solutions have been able to achieve the level of PB margin calculations and stress testing that Cassini now offers. By expanding coverage across more PBs to include stress-based, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and rule-based models, combined with new stress testing capabilities, Cassini is democratizing access to critical buy-side treasury and risk solutions.

<div> DTCC, REGnosys, ISDA DRR, GTR, trade reporting
Summary:<br /><br />DTCC and REGnosys collaborate to support ISDA DRR for trade reporting. GTR testing and connectivity to ensure compliance with global regulations. <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that it is working with REGnosys to support industry adoption of the ISDA Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) solution and aid compliance with forthcoming global derivatives trade reporting rewrites. The ISDA DRR establishes a golden-source interpretation of market practices and trade reporting logic, developed through industry consensus.</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, REGnosys&rsquo;s Rosetta, the first ISDA DRR-native regulatory reporting platform, is connecting to the testing environment of DTCC&rsquo;s Global Trade Repository (GTR) service. The connection enables the reliable testing of trade reporting submissions made using the ISDA DRR to confirm that submissions are accepted as valid by DTCC&rsquo;s GTR in support of evolving trade reporting requirements. DTCC&rsquo;s GTR users will benefit from the solution&rsquo;s alignment with the industry consensus interpretation of the rules captured in the ISDA DRR.</p>
<p>ISDA&rsquo;s DRR leverages the Common Domain Model (CDM) &ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; to convert market practices and trade reporting rules into unambiguous, machine-executable code. It supports the transformation of trade data into the ISO 20022 format, as mandated by regulators, and ensures all validation rules are performed when reports get submitted to Trade Repositories like GTR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DTCC has been supportive of ISDA&rsquo;s DRR since its inception, and we are pleased to collaborate with REGnosys to help facilitate the development of a complete, accurate, timely and cost-effective transaction reporting mechanism in accordance with trade reporting rewrite requirements leveraging the ISDA DRR,&rdquo; stated Syed Ali, Managing Director, DTCC Repository and Derivatives Services. &ldquo;As more and more firms consider how to simplify their architectures, this is the next step towards providing a streamlined, standard trade reporting generation application that evolves as rules evolve along with machine-readable regulatory requirements, from a single source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on this workflow, Leo Labeis, Chief Executive Officer at REGnosys, said: "REGnosys has put its Rosetta platform into action to serve the industry&rsquo;s adoption of the ISDA DRR from the start, so we are proud to be joining forces with DTCC to further encourage this development. In a context of rapidly evolving global trade reporting requirements, this is the next step towards offering our clients certainty and effectiveness in hitting compliance deadlines using the industry&rsquo;s best-in-class solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using the ISDA DRR brings greater accuracy and efficiency to regulatory reporting and enables firms to comply with reporting rule changes in multiple jurisdictions at scale, so we&rsquo;re delighted that DTCC and REGnosys are supporting industry adoption by enabling the validation of trade reporting submissions generated with the ISDA DRR by the Global Trade Repository,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>DTCC provides trade repository services for derivatives and securities financing transactions through its GTR, the industry leader in trade reporting. As the only industry-owned and governed global provider of trade reporting services, GTR is uniquely positioned to help market participants address some of their most important operational and regulatory challenges in an ever-evolving environment.</p>
<p>REGnosys provides leading-edge regulatory reporting technology to the global financial industry. With thousands of users globally, its low-code collaboration platform, Rosetta, allows firms to crowd source the reporting logic and automate its deployment in their compliance systems. REGnosys is therefore uniquely placed to enable the development and adoption of the ISDA DRR solution.</p>
<p>The first phase of the collaboration between DTCC and REGnosys included testing and support for firms looking to leverage the ISDA DRR for trade reporting requirements related to regulatory amendments introduced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA) and under the EU&rsquo;s European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). The next phase of the development efforts to support rule changes under UK EMIR and by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is currently underway in the ISDA DRR and is expected to launch in April this year.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: New Way Of Paying For Investment Research Proposed By The Financial Regulator</title>

<div> proposed, investment research, FCA, payment options, competition <br />
Summary:<br /> The FCA plans to change the way investment research is paid for, providing more options, supporting competition, and aligning with international rules. <br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has put forward plans for a new way to pay for investment research.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Analysis by the FCA shows that asset managers are largely getting the research they need under the current rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the current options available to UK asset managers can be operationally complex and may, in some instances, favour larger asset managers. The current rules can also restrict UK asset managers&rsquo; ability to buy investment research produced outside the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the government's&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-services-the-edinburgh-reforms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Edinburgh reforms<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, an independent report on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64a838381121040013ee6522/UK_INVESTMENT_RESEARCH_REVIEW_-_RACHEL_KENT_10.7.23.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">investment research<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;suggested ways to improve UK markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the FCA has proposed giving asset managers greater freedom in how they pay for research, supporting their investment decisions. This greater choice should suit firms of varying business models and sizes, helping to promote competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will allow the &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; of payments for third-party research and trade execution, and would exist alongside those already available, such as payment from an asset manager's own resources or from a dedicated account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new plans are also compatible with rules governing research payments in certain other major jurisdictions, making it easier for asset managers to buy research in the same way, across borders. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets and International, at the FCA said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'High quality, easily accessible investment research is a vital part of a healthy, dynamic capital market. It supports the decisions investors make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We are proposing to provide more options on how to pay for such research, helping boost competition and making it easier to buy research across borders.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA has engaged extensively with sell-side and buy-side firms, as well as research providers and representatives of end investors, reviewed written analysis, and has conducted a detailed survey of buy-side firms to collect quantitative evidence before announcing its proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA aims to produce final rules in the first half of 2024, after carefully considering the feedback it receives, but the timetable will be determined by the amount, strength and breadth of the information gathered in the consultation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA will continue to work with government partners on the other recommendations relevant to it made in the independent Investment Research Review.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Improving Picture For Personal Finances, But Many Still Struggling</title>

<div> struggling, financial commitments, FCA, debt advice, borrowers<br />
Summary:<br />
FCA research shows improvement in financial struggles. Borrowers urged to seek support. Regulator enforces stronger protections. Lenders must offer help and comply with new rules. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>New research from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found that while many are struggling to meet financial commitments, the picture has improved over the last year.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The regulator found 7.4m people were struggling to pay bills and credit repayments in January 2024, down from 10.9m in January 2023. This is still higher than the 5.8m recorded in February 2020, before the cost of living squeeze began.</p>
<p>As the FCA confirms stronger protections for borrowers, the regulator is reminding those in financial difficulty to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact your lender for support if you&rsquo;re worried about keeping up with payments. Talking to your lender about your options won&rsquo;t impact your credit score.</li>
<li>Visit MoneyHelper for tips on living on a squeezed income and to find free, expert debt advice.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Over 5m (5.5m) people said they had fallen behind or missed paying one or more domestic bills or credit commitments in the previous 6 months from January 2024. This was down from 6.6m people a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the 12 months to January 2024, 2.7m adults sought help from a lender, a debt adviser or other financial support charity because they found themselves in financial difficulty. Nearly half (47%) of those that sought help said they were in a better position as a result. However, 2 in 5 adults who had fallen behind on their bills said they had avoided talking to their lender about their finances.</p>
<p>Renters, single adults with children, adults from a minority ethnic background and people living in the north-east of England were more likely to be in financial difficulty.</p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition said:</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Our research shows many people are still struggling with their bills, though it is encouraging to see some benefitting from the help that&rsquo;s available.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;re worried about keeping up with payments, reach out to your lender straight away. They have a range of support options and will work with you to agree the best one for you. You can also find free debt advice through MoneyHelper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The FCA has reminded financial firms they must support their customers and work with them to manage payment difficulties. The regulator has cracked down where firms haven&rsquo;t met its expectations, securing nearly &pound;60 million in compensation for 270,000 customers.</p>
<p>The FCA has also confirmed stronger protections for borrowers. It is making permanent the expectations on lenders to support borrowers in difficulty, which were introduced during the pandemic, with additional targeted changes designed to improve outcomes for consumers.</p>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<ol>
<li>This new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/financial-lives/jan-2024-recontact-survey-summary" title="Financial Lives cost of living (Jan 2024) recontact survey - Summary">cost of living survey</a>&nbsp;was conducted among 3,450 UK adults who had previously completed the FCA&rsquo;s main Financial Lives survey in May 2022.&nbsp;It was conducted between 8 December 2023 and 28 January 2024, with 76% of the responses provided in January 2024.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-2-strengthening-protections-borrowers-financial-difficulty" title="PS24/2: Strengthening protections for borrowers in financial difficulty: Consumer credit and mortgages">Policy Statement 24/2: Strengthening protections for borrowers in financial difficulty: Consumer credit and mortgages</a></li>

<li>The new rules come into force on 4 November 2024. By incorporating aspects of its tailored support guidance (TSG) into its rulebook, the FCA is:  
<ul>
<li>expanding protections beyond customers who have already missed payments, to those at risk of payment difficulty</li>
<li>widening the forbearance options firms should consider</li>
<li>enhancing expectations around customer engagement and providing information including on money guidance and debt advice</li>
<li>requiring credit firms to consider customers&rsquo; individual circumstances when providing forbearance (which is already expected for mortgage firms)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The FCA is also introducing additional improvements beyond the TSG by:  
<ul>
<li>introducing guidance to help firms determine their necessary and reasonable costs in setting fees and charges&nbsp;</li>
<li>allowing mortgage lenders greater scope to clear a payment shortfall by adding it to the total amount owed, meaning customers are better able to access new products and build their credit score</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To support people dealing with cost of living pressures, the FCA has also:  
<ul>
<li>reminded 3,500 lenders how it expects them to provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/borrowers-financial-difficulty-following-coronavirus-pandemic-key-findings" target="_blank">tailored support to borrowers</a>&nbsp;who get into financial difficulty&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-enable-firms-provide-mortgage-breathing-space" target="_blank">updated its rules</a>&nbsp;to support key commitments made by lenders as part of the government&rsquo;s mortgage charter, building on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-confirms-help-mortgage-borrowers-struggling-payments" target="_blank">guidance for how lenders can help customers</a>&nbsp;worried about keeping up with payments&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury And IRS Release Proposed Guidance On Stock Buyback Excise Tax To Ensure Large Corporations Pay More Of Their Fair Share In Taxes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> proposed regulations, stock buyback excise tax, calculation, Form 7208, foreign-parented multinational corporations

Summary:<br />Proposed regulations clarify stock buyback excise tax calculation. Form 7208 must be used to report and pay the tax. Targeted anti-abuse rule for foreign-parented multinational corporations. <div>
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued two Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (proposed regulations) on the stock buyback or &ldquo;repurchase&rdquo; excise tax included in President Biden&rsquo;s Inflation Reduction Act, a key provision that helps ensure large corporations pay more of their fair share in taxes. As the tax code has favored stock buybacks, many companies have failed to reinvest profits in their workers, growth, and innovation. The stock buyback excise tax begins to change that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Biden&rsquo;s Inflation Reduction Act helps ensure that large corporations pay their fair share, just as American families do,&rdquo; said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. &ldquo;This proposed rule is a key part of the Biden Administration&rsquo;s efforts to improve tax fairness and reduce the deficit by closing loopholes and ensuring wealthy individuals, large corporations, and complex partnerships pay taxes owed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed regulations provide additional clarity to taxpayers and tax professionals on how to properly calculate and pay the new stock buyback excise tax on corporate stock buybacks, and largely adopt the framework of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-02.pdf">Notice 2023-2</a>, published on January 17, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The stock buyback excise tax applies at a rate of one percent of the fair market value (FMV) of any stock of a covered corporation that is repurchased by the corporation during its taxable year, minus the aggregate FMV of stock issued by the taxpayer during that year. The statute generally defines a &ldquo;covered corporation&rdquo; as a domestic corporation whose stock is&nbsp;publicly traded on an established securities market. An established securities market for this&nbsp;purpose includes U.S. national securities exchanges, certain foreign securities exchanges, regional or local exchanges, and certain interdealer quotation systems. &ldquo;Repurchases&rdquo; (or buybacks) include a corporation&rsquo;s acquisition of any of its stock from a shareholder for property that qualifies as a&nbsp;redemption of the stock as defined in the tax code.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The Inflation Reduction Act also provides that a &ldquo;repurchase&rdquo; (buyback) includes any other transaction that the Secretary determines in regulations or other guidance to be &ldquo;economically similar&rdquo; to a redemption of stock. These economically similar transactions include buybacks of corporate stock that occur in connection with certain corporate mergers, separations, and other M&amp;A transactions.&nbsp; A &ldquo;repurchase&rdquo; also may include acquisitions of the corporation&rsquo;s stock by certain specified affiliates.</p>
<p>The proposed regulations also provide a targeted anti-abuse rule to foreign-parented multinational corporations pay their fair share of the stock buyback excise tax, without ordinary course intercompany funding transactions among their corporate affiliates being inadvertently captured.</p>
<p>The proposed regulations would provide that the stock repurchase excise tax must be reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-720">IRS Form 720,</a>&nbsp;Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-dft/f7208--dft.pdf">Form 7208</a>&nbsp;attached. The Form 7208 would be used to figure the amount of stock repurchase excise tax owed. A draft version of the Form 7208 is currently accessible, and the final version of the form will be released prior to the first due date on which the stock repurchase excise tax must be reported and paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As anticipated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-23-18.pdf">Announcement 2023-18</a>, the proposed regulations would establish that, for taxpayers with a taxable year ending after December 31, 2022, but before the publication of final regulations, any liability for the stock repurchase excise tax for the taxable year must be reported on the Form 720 that is due for the first full quarter after the date the final regulations are published, and that the deadline for payment of the tax is the same as the filing deadline.</p>

<div> Keywords: MRAC, CCP Risk and Governance, AI in Financial Markets, Market Structure, Climate-Related Market Risk<br />
<br />
Summary: Introduction to MRAC meeting. Recommendations and reports on CCP resilience, AI integration, FCM capacity, treasury workstream, and voluntary carbon credit markets. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Introduction</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Good morning, I am honored to welcome you to the first Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) meeting of 2024. At this meeting, the MRAC will introduce formal recommendations, reports, and presentations with insightful guidance to improve the integrity and stability of our markets. These include an unprecedented analysis of the state of intermediated clearing markets and the significant reduction in the number of FCMs providing trade execution services over two decades. The Market Structure Subcommittee will also examine the U.S. Treasury cash-futures basis trade and risk management implications. The Future of Finance Subcommittee&rsquo;s AI and Risk Management workstream will share it&rsquo;s working plan, outlining initial observations and potential suggestions for navigating the complex landscape of AI integration in financial markets.</p>
<p>Today, we continue the long tradition of this Committee&rsquo;s engagement with the Commission, its valuable insight into the concerns that shape the stability and integrity of global derivatives markets, and its collaboration toward developing ways that the industry and the Commission can prepare for and mitigate the most critical risks facing our markets today. The work of this Committee influences industry standards and best practices and provides thought leadership on many of the most important issues that will impact citizens and businesses in every corner of the world by shaping the direction of the development of markets.</p>
<p><span>CCP Risk and Governance</span></p>
<p>The Central Counterparty Risk and Governance Subcommittee, co-chaired by Alessandro Cocco, Vice President in the Financial Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, on detail as Senior Policy Advisor at the Department of Treasury and Alicia Crighton, Chair of the Futures Industry Association Board of Directors will share a presentation, a report, and recommendations on behalf of the Recovery &amp; Resolution workstream. The recommendations reflect the collective work of the Subcommittee, whose members include diverse stakeholders, including representatives from derivatives clearing organizations (&ldquo;DCOs&rdquo;), clearing members, end-users, public interest advocates and academics.</p>
<p>As the report notes:</p>
<p>CCPs are fundamental market structures in derivatives markets and gained further prominence following the post-2008 financial crisis reforms. The G20 nations committed to have all standardized OTC derivatives, where appropriate, cleared through CCPs by 2012.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act reformed the legislative framework for U.S. CCPs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act sets core principles for DCOs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Lawmakers addressed CCP resilience by requiring CCPs to have adequate financial, operational, and managerial resources to discharge their responsibilities and to have in place appropriate risk management tools and procedures. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a novel type of regulated entity, a systemically important DCO. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, in fact, gave the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&ldquo;FSOC&rdquo;) the authority to designate as systemically important those clearing entities (<i>e.g.</i>, DCOs) that &ldquo;are or are likely to become, systemically important&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Systemically important DCOs (&ldquo;SIDCOs&rdquo;) are subject to enhanced prudential and risk management standards and procedures.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In addition, Title VIII introduced an enhanced supervisory regime for SIDCOs that imposed on the CFTC the obligation to conduct annual examinations of these firms.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In addition to the domestic reforms adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, since 2010, international standard-setting bodies have been very active in adopting principles, guidance, and standards to support and inform national policymakers in the regulation of CCPs. The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (&ldquo;CPMI&rdquo;), the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (&ldquo;CPSS&rdquo;) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (&ldquo;IOSCO&rdquo;) (together, &ldquo;CPMI-IOSCO&rdquo; and &ldquo;CPSS-IOSCO&rdquo;, respectively), and the Financial Stability Board (the &ldquo;FSB&rdquo;) have published extensive reports on CCP resilience, recovery, and resolution. In 2012, CPSS-IOSCO published the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (&ldquo;PFMI&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;a set of 24 principles that should apply to financial market infrastructures, including CCPs, with the ultimate goal of enhancing their safety and efficiency.</p>
<p>Many of the PFMIs address the resilience of CCPs and their capacity to manage financial risk. The PFMI approach to CCP resilience builds on four aspects, developed in an&nbsp;<i>ad hoc</i>&nbsp;additional guidance report:<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;(1) governance arrangements of CCPs;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;(2) comprehensive risk management frameworks;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;(3) financial resources allocated to loss absorption;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;and (4) stress testing for both credit and liquidity exposures.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;CPMI-IOSCO acknowledges that it is vital for CCPs to have sufficient resilience to withstand clearing member failures and other stress events&mdash;and this is even more critical in the current market landscape, characterized by the mandatory central clearing of certain standardized OTC derivatives. To complement the resilience guidelines, CPMI-IOSCO also published a report on the recovery of CCPs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The recommendations on recovery focus on CCPs&rsquo; adoption of transparent and effective recovery plans, where the interests of all affected stakeholders are considered, and that contain different recovery tools appropriate to meet different recovery objectives.</p>
<p>At the international level, the FSB has been quite active as well. In 2017, the FSB published guidelines for CCP resolution and resolution planning.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;In March 2022, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FSB, together with the CPMI and IOSCO, commenced new work to assess CCP financial resources in the context of recovery and resolution.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;The FSB acknowledged the increased systemic importance of CCPs in markets that embraced central clearing and evaluated the operation of recovery mechanisms. However, the FSB concluded by admitting the necessity of additional input from stakeholders on the sufficiency of the existing toolkit for CCP resolution, in particular on non-default loss scenarios. The FSB further noted the need for potential alternative financial resources and tools for CCP resolution, along with an analysis of the costs and benefits (including effectiveness and impact on incentives) of such alternatives. In September 2023, the FSB launched a public consultation on financial resources and tools for CCPs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The consultation, that ended in November 2023, proposed a regulatory toolbox approach as a global standard for CCPs resolution. &ldquo;In this approach, home resolution authorities for systemically important CCPs should have access to a set of resolution-specific resources and tools to meet the objectives for financial resources to support resolution, in addition to the use of recovery<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The FSB is working on finalizing its report, taking into account comments received during the consultation period. As discussed above, since 2008, domestic lawmakers and international standard-setting bodies have established regulations and standards that have substantially enhanced the resilience of CCPs. Such resilience has been demonstrated by the successful performance of CCPs during extreme stress events, including a historic global pandemic. Attention has more recently turned toward CCP recovery and wind-down as international standard standard-setting bodies issue various forms of guidance.</p>
<p>Since 2013, SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs have been subject to the requirement to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans. In July 2016, the staff of the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Clearing and Risk (&ldquo;DCR&rdquo;) issued an advisory letter (&ldquo;guidance&rdquo;) regarding the content of a SIDCO&rsquo;s and Subpart C DCO&rsquo;s recovery and orderly wind-down plans. In response to CFTC regulations and such guidance, SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs spent considerable time, in collaboration with DCR, analyzing scenarios that could prevent a DCO from being able to meet its obligations and to provide its critical operations and services; developing and implementing recovery tools, wind-down scenarios and options; analyzing interconnections and interdependencies; evaluating agreements to be maintained during recovery and wind-down; reviewing financial resources, governance arrangements, and notification policies; establishing a framework for regular policy updates; and conducting testing. This analysis resulted in significant revisions to DCO policies and practices to address recovery and wind-down.</p>
<p>SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs have spent considerable time responding to guidance and have taken material steps to reduce systemic risk within the financial system. The Commission is now proposing to codify some of that guidance in the proposed rule. The Commission believes that most, if not all, of the proposals are already incorporated into the plans submitted by SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs. But the proposed requirements will be new for other DCOs. Informal guidance and rules do not have the same weight, as guidance is non-binding, nor is guidance subject to public consultation. Moreover, the rule applies to all DCOs whereas the guidance applies to SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Title VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, and taking into account the international standards set by CPMI-IOSCO and the FSB, the CFTC adopted a proposed rule for DCOs recovery and orderly wind-down plans. The CFTC is &ldquo;proposing, among other things: (1) for SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs, that they should incorporate certain subjects and analyses in their viable plans for recovery and orderly wind-down; and (2) for all other DCOs, that they should maintain viable plans for orderly wind-down that incorporate substantially similar subjects and analyses as the proposed requirements for SIDCOs and Subpart C DCOs.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The report includes a number of important recommendations, which, if adopted by MRAC, can be used by the Commission to inform the development of the final rule on DCO resilience, recovery, and orderly wind-down. The recommendations include:</p>
<p>First, implementation of supervisory stress tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commission staff should adopt and implement supervisory stress testing of credit and liquidity risks for all DCOs.</li>
<li>Commission staff should adopt and implement operational and other non-default risk stress testing, leveraging industry exercises covering these risks, where appropriate.</li>
<li>Commission staff should include reverse stress tests in their supervisory stress tests.</li>
<li>The results of the supervisory stress tests should be made available to the public, in a level of detail determined to be appropriate by Commission staff, within a reasonable time after the stress tests have been concluded.</li>
<li>Subcommittee members representing end users, FCMs and academia believe these stress test should be required to take place at least annually. Subcommittee members representing DCOs do not believe that the frequency of reverse stress tests should be annual but rather that the frequency of reverse stress tests should be determined by Commission staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, regarding recovery scenarios and analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the final rule, the text of CFTC Regulation 39.39(c)(2) should be amended to require that DCOs conduct scenario analysis that includes extreme but plausible scenarios that could trigger recovery or wind down.</li>
<li>The final rule should require that SIDCOs include in their plans an assessment of (1) the financial resources and tools available in the event of recovery and wind-down, and (2) how they would address the scenarios identified that could trigger recovery and wind-down.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, regarding non-default losses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Commission should retain the proposal to require a DCO that is neither a SIDCO nor a Subpart C DCO to maintain and submit to the Commission viable plans for orderly wind-down necessitated by default losses as well as NDLs.</li>
<li>The Commission should retain the proposed definition of NDL as applied to all DCOs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding the provision of data for resolution planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subcommittee members believe that the Commission and FDIC should develop an inter-agency task force to discuss the sharing of information for resolution planning purposes. However, Subcommittee members representing DCOs believe that coordination already occurs between the FDIC and CFTC with respect to SIDCOs, that an interagency task force is not necessary, and that coordination can and will continue to occur through existing channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, finally, regarding challenges to porting of customer positions and collateral during resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Commission should develop an inter-agency task force, which should include the National Futures Association (NFA) to discuss and address impediments to the porting of customer position and collateral in the context of a DCO resolution and clearing member default.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have maintained an unwavering commitment to researching and proposing regulatory solutions for AI in financial markets, driven by a steadfast dedication to ensure integrity and stability in this rapidly evolving landscape. Five years ago, I began to convene and participate in convenings of AI developers, adopters, academics, government and industry researchers, regulators, and public interest organizations.</p>
<p>In 2020, a co-author and I received invitations to publish two books, one of which examines the ethical implications of AI across diverse sectors of our society. In two recent speeches, a speech last month before the New York Bar Association and a speech at Japanese Fintech Week in Tokyo, Japan, I have advocated for the CFTC to begin to identify best practices for integrating AI in our markets. Last week while in South Africa, I offered remarks at the South African Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Fintech Summit about the regulation of novel financial products as well as the rapid development and deployment of generative AI and its impact on financial markets.</p>
<p>While the use of AI in financial markets may hold the potential for substantial benefits, such use may also introduce unprecedented risks concerning market integrity, customer protection, governance, data privacy, bias, and cyber threats.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;The derivatives market provides many potential applications for AI. Accordingly, given the Commission&rsquo;s mandate to promote responsible innovation while safeguarding market integrity, effective risk management is essential to address these concerns.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the Commission issued a request for comment (RFC) to &ldquo;to assess the benefits associated with the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets, to inform staff&rsquo;s supervisory oversight and to evaluate the need for any future guidance and rulemakings.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;The RFC solicits responses to 20 questions that cover a wide range of topics, including the definition of AI, general and specific use-cases, market manipulation, and consumer protection.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, the Future of Finance Subcommittee held a public meeting on March 15, 2024, which focused on the use of artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) in CFTC-regulated markets. This meeting supports work initiated at the MRAC meetings over nearly two years. The MRAC meetings have long served as an effective venue for exchanging diverse viewpoints on critical issues facing futures and derivatives markets. Dating back to the first MRAC meeting of 2022, the panel recognized the transformative innovation in the market of digital assets, where broad collaboration and information sharing were deemed to be essential for financial institutions to mitigate significant risks associated with digital assets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In 2017, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued a report on market developments related to AI and the financial stability implications. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have published recommendations that offer guidelines for governing AI. More recently, the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued a report following a consultation on the use of AI by market intermediaries. These efforts include a number of common threads, suggesting that, while many questions remain, there are important areas of consensus regarding the right approach to AI in financial markets. A few of these commonalities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>A focus on the governance of AI models</span>.&nbsp;</span>FSOC &ldquo;recommends monitoring the rapid developments in AI, including generative AI, to ensure that oversight structures keep up with or stay ahead of emerging risks to the financial system while facilitating efficiency and innovation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, IOSCO has recommended that&ldquo;[r]egulators should consider requiring firms to have designated senior management responsible for the oversight of the development, testing, deployment, monitoring and controls of AI and [machine learning]. This includes a documented internal governance framework, with clear lines of accountability.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><br /><br />CFTC regulations, for example, introduce important governance obligations for registered market participants. Designated Clearing Organizations must establish a Risk Management Committee &ldquo;comprised of clearing members and customers of clearing members on matters that could materially affect the risk profile of the DCO&rdquo; and Risk Management Working Groups composed of market participants.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;Enhanced risk management oversight and governance best practices will play an important role in managing the development and implementation of AI.</li>
<li><span><span>Promoting the explainability of AI models</span>.&nbsp;</span>Many AI models are &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; models, meaning that it may be difficult, and in some cases impossible, to explain their decision-making processes. Accordingly, FSOC, IOSCO, the FSB, and FINRA have all emphasized the importance of addressing the explainability challenge.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;As FINRA put it, [i]ncorporating explainability as a key consideration in the model risk management process for AI-based applications.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></li>
<li><span>The need for data controls.</span>&nbsp;Data quality, security and privacy are central concerns for regulators as market participants adopt AI models. FSOC recent report notes, &ldquo;data controls like data quality, suitability, security, privacy, and timeliness are vital to sound AI use.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, FINRA calls for &ldquo;data governance efforts&rdquo; including: &ldquo;data review for potential bias,&rdquo; &ldquo;data source verification,&rdquo; &ldquo;data integration,&rdquo; &ldquo;data security,&rdquo; and &ldquo;data quality benchmarks and metrics.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></li>
<li><span>Implementing measures to address bias.&nbsp;</span>In 2019, I testified before Congress and voiced my concerns that AI models trained on incomplete or inaccurate data may engender biased results. Consistent with these concerns voiced by civil rights advocates, the White House AI Bill of Rights emphasizes the need to ensure fairness and guard against bias. In its report, FSOC notes that &ldquo;specific requirements to prevent discrimination or bias that apply to tools, models, or processes used in consumer compliance also apply to AI. This is an important consideration because without proper design, testing, and controls, AI can lead to disparate outcomes, which may cause direct consumer harm and/or raise consumer compliance risks.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></li>
<li><span>Testing and monitoring output.&nbsp;</span>Protecting against bias, promoting explainability, and implementing governance strategies are only possible where models are properly tested and monitored. FSOC, IOSCO, the FSB, and FINRA have each emphasized the importance of testing. FSOC notes the responsibility of financial institutions to &ldquo;monitor the quality and applicability of AI&rsquo;s output&rdquo; the ability of regulators to &ldquo;help to ensure that they do so.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, the FSB recognizes the importance of &ldquo;[a]ssessing AI and machine learning applications for risks, including adherence to any relevant protocols regarding data privacy, conduct risks, and cybersecurity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;Existing approaches to issues like cybersecurity offer some guidance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, in a statement regarding a proposed cyber resilience rulemaking, I noted the importance of comprehensive regulation in this area, including regulations that capture mission-critical third-party service providers.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;Model testing and oversight, which concerns cybersecurity, and much more, must similarly be comprehensive in the parties and the issues that it captures.</p>
<p>I have advocated interventions for the Commission to foster responsible use of AI in financial markets. First, I have encouraged greater visibility and transparency regarding our registrants&rsquo; use of AI by expanding our annual systems examination questionnaire to incorporate questions that directly inquire about the adoption of AI and related risks. Additionally, I have proposed for the development of a principles-based framework. In consultation with members of this working group of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, I look forward to exploring a principles-based regulatory framework that underscores intelligibility, risk management, compliance, oversight, market responsibility, notice, and explainability.</p>
<p>Further, I have advocated for the Commission to consider introducing heightened penalties for those who intentionally use AI technologies to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or the evasion of our regulations. Finally, the Commission should lead in creating an inter-agency task force focused on information sharing and composed of market and prudential regulators including the CFTC, SEC, Federal Reserve System, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FHFA, and NCUA. The task force would support the AI Safety Institute in developing guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for the use and regulation of AI in the financial services industry. It may also provide recommendations to the AI Safety Institute as well as evaluate proposals coming out of the Institute.</p>
<p>In consultation with members of this Subcommittee, I look forward to exploring the ways in which the Commission can ensure that oversight structures keep up with or stay ahead of emerging risks to the financial system while facilitating efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>Building on our productive dialogue over the last year and a half, we will hear from Gary Kalbaugh, deputy general counsel and director at ING Financial Holdings Corp., who will outline for us the ambitious workplan that the Subcommittee has adopted for its AI workstream.</p>
<p>This workplan will guide the Subcommittee&rsquo;s development of recommendations for this Committee on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.</p>
<p>The Subcommittee endorses FSOC&rsquo;s recommendation to monitor the &ldquo;rapid developments in AI, including generative AI, to ensure that oversight structures keep up with or stay ahead of emerging risks to the financial system while facilitating efficiency and innovation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Based on its review of the statements and materials presented at its inaugural meeting, the Subcommittee has developed a work plan. This is an initial plan only: the Subcommittee intends to further review, research and develop the plan for future presentation to the full committee and, as appropriate, the Commission:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conducting a Survey on the Use of AI in CFTC-regulated Markets.</strong>&nbsp;The Subcommittee believes that it may be useful for the Commission to conduct a survey<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;of CFTC registrants&rsquo; use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets. The survey could be designed to inform the Subcommittee, the full committee, as well as the Commission and its staff on how different types of AI are being used, how its risk are being mitigated, and by which CFTC registered market participants.<br /><br />The Subcommittee would further consider the design of the survey, including: (1) whether such a survey should be incorporated into Commission and divisional staff examinations and other oversight and monitoring tools and mechanisms;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;and (2) whether the survey would be mandatory for CFTC registered market participants. The Subcommittee will provide a recommendation on this matter and present it to the full Committee for potential presentation to the Commission.</li>
<li><span>Recommendations on New Guidance, Advisories or Rulemaking.</span>&nbsp;The Subcommittee may advance a recommendation that the staff should consider new guidance, advisories or formal rulemaking, based on how CFTC market participants are using AI to conduct regulated activities and any gaps identified in existing regulations and guidance. Areas of focus may include, without limitation:<ol>
<li><span>Framing the Risk of AI Models.</span>&nbsp;Whether CFTC registrants should be required to disclose or explain<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;key attributes and risks of those models, including those created by third parties.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;This may include enhanced requirements for registrants that are using AI for critical requirements such as compliance, client-facing business activities, or market regulation functions.</li>
<li><span>Robust Monitoring and Testing of AI Models.</span>&nbsp;Whether CFTC market participants should adhere to additional requirements regarding testing and monitoring of AI models as used in CFTC-regulated activities.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;Potential areas of testing and monitoring may include cybersecurity, data controls, bias, privacy, and output consistency.</li>
<li><span>Oversight and of AI Models.</span>&nbsp;Whether additional guidance is appropriate to clarify oversight and governance expectations for AI models used in CFTC-regulated activities. Such arrangements that the subcommittee may consider include a comprehensive governance framework and designated personnel focused on AI oversight, including senior management with functional understandings of AI to permit adequate supervision.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;The subcommittee will consider the degree to which a materiality standard is appropriate, as well as concentration<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;and other risks.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With sincerest gratitude, I would like to acknowledge the hard work put in by the Subcommittee members to advance this workplan and special thanks to Gary for presenting it here today.</p>
<p><span>Market Structure</span></p>
<p>Next, we will hear presentations from members of the Market Structure Subcommittee, co-chaired by Ann Battle, Senior Counsel, Market Transitions &amp; Head of Benchmark Reform at ISDA, and Biswarup Chatterjee, Managing Director and Head of Innovation for the Global Markets Division at Citigroup. The FCM Capacity Workstream will present a cover letter attaching a data analysis examining current state of the market for futures commission merchants (FCMs). FCMs serve as critical intermediaries in cleared markets. The workstream created and analyzed a database of publicly available financial information for FCMs, and noted industry consolidation and an increased concentration in the market for FCM services.&gt;</p>
<p><i>Treasury workstream</i></p>
<p>The Treasury Reform workstream will provide a presentation on U.S. treasury cash-futures basis trades and risk management considerations. This presentation will be delivered by Nathaniel Wuerffel, Head of Market Structure, at Bank of New York Mellon. This presentation underscores issues raised during the December 11, 2023 MRAC meeting when the Subcommittee provided a general overview of the state of the U.S. treasury markets, including the role of the basis trade in U.S. treasury markets, risk-management practices that are intended to limit leverage, oversight and transparency, and regulatory changes impacting these markets. Today&rsquo;s presentation explores the mechanics of these trades, the benefits and risks, and potential ways to manage risks associated with these trades.</p>
<p><i>PTRR and Block Trade</i></p>
<p>We will also hear brief updates from two other workstreams of the Market Structure Subcommittee. The post-trade risk reduction workstream will provide an update on its work and plans to further develop proposed recommendations in order ensure that any recommended changes preserve the systemic risk and financial market stability goals of Title VII. The block trade workstream will provide a brief update in light of industry-wide efforts to conduct a centralize data analysis to inform block trade policy.</p>
<p><span>Climate-Related Market Risk</span></p>
<p>In December of last year, the CFTC issued Proposed Guidance Regarding the Listing of Voluntary Carbon Credit Derivatives Contracts and issued a request for comment from the public on the proposed guidance. As I said at the time that it was difficult to overstate the importance of the guidance, and trumpeted how &ldquo;[o]nce again, the CFTC is demonstrating leadership in the novel carbon credit markets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;I remain excited about how the guidance might evolve going forward, particularly in light of the extensive public engagement that the Commission received in response.</p>
<p>As I also said at the time of the Guidance, however, &ldquo;I find the Proposed Guidance to be necessary, but insufficient,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement040924#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;and that I hoped that it would be the beginning of robust consideration of how the CFTC might be able to use its authority to foster and improve the market going forward. The Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee convened a roundtable on March 15, 2024 and expert speakers offered guidance on their understanding of the foundational issues challenging the market for carbon credits.</p>
<p>The roundtable focused on three main topics related to the carbon credit markets: (1) market integrity, disclosure, transparency and enforcement, (2) market design and intermediation, and (3) product design and reliability.</p>
<p>Regarding market integrity, Holly Pearen of the Environmental Defense Fund, who we will be hearing from again today, warned the Subcommittee that poorer quality voluntary carbon credits are overwhelmingly bought and sold in over-the-counter and less transparent carbon credit transactions. Panelists also argued that the CFTC should ensure that crediting programs properly implement social safeguards so that credits created with co-benefits for local communities do in fact go to the intended communities.</p>
<p>The second panel of the roundtable focused on how market design and intermediation can make carbon credit markets stronger. Panelists from diverse viewpoints as exchanges and a dairy industry association were consistent that robust and liquid markets for carbon credits and their derivative products promote greater integrity of the underlying credits through the market&rsquo;s reflection of the quality of the credits in their price. The third panel focused on the design of the products themselves, including a discussion of the legal nature of carbon credits, and the importance of integrity standards that focus on results and use data to analyze the quality of the voluntary carbon credits.</p>
<p>Across the board, the roundtable participants were enthusiastic for the CFTC to create more robust standards. If carbon credits are going to be a force for good in the monumental task to limit anthropogenic atmospheric carbon, a firmer hand from regulators and standard-setting bodies will be critical.</p>
<p>Today we will hear from three different speakers regarding voluntary carbon markets. The first will be the unique perspective of Dale Lewis, joining us from Zambia, who is the CEO of Community Markets for Conservation, or COMACO. Mr. Lewis and his company do the on-the-ground work in Zambia of building the various carbon-limiting projects that are the source of voluntary carbon credits currently being traded. We will also hear from two people who spoke at the March 15 roundtable as well: Holly Pearen from the Environmental Defense Fund, and Jessica Garcia from Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund. Both Ms. Pearen and Ms. Garcia will be sharing their thoughts on the critical issues facing the voluntary carbon markets today, and discuss what they think the subcommittee should be studying going forward.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting is an opportunity to roll up our sleeves and begin to chart a course for the development and completion of the important work that the MRAC Subcommittees have and will explore this year. I am hopeful for an open and meaningful discussion among MRAC members regarding the critical issues facing our markets.</p>
<p>Allow me to thank our MRAC Chair and Chair of the FIA Board, Alicia Crighton; MRAC Designated Federal Officer (DFO) Tamika Bent; and MRAC Alternate DFO Peter Janowski. I also thank each of the ADFOs who support MRAC&mdash;Rebecca Lewis Tierney and Julia Welch.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the CFTC logistics and administrative staff and contractors who ensured that our physical conference room and our virtual conference room were ready to go for our members and our invited speakers, including Altonio Downing, Monae Mills, Andy Brighton, Keane McBride, Venise Raphael-Constant, Margie Yates, Jean Cespedes, Pete Santos, and Ty Poole.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for joining us today. I look forward to a robust and informative discussion.</p>

<div> Micro U.S. Treasury futures, CME Group, trading, interest rates, benchmarks
<br />
CME Group's new Micro U.S. Treasury futures surpass 100,000 contracts in just two weeks. Cash-settled and one-tenth the size of Ultra contracts, offering greater flexibility. High Q1 trading volume reported.
<br /><br />Summary: CME Group's Micro U.S. Treasury futures see rapid adoption, offering smaller sizes, automatic margin offsets, and increased trading flexibility. <div>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that trading in its new Micro U.S. Treasury futures has surpassed 100,000 contracts since launching just two weeks ago on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 25</span>.</p>
<p>"As the world's most liquid market for U.S. Treasury futures,&nbsp;CME Group is pleased that so many of our global clients are incorporating smaller-sized Micro U.S. Treasury futures into their trading strategies,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Agha Mirza</span>, CME Group Global Head of Interest Rates and OTC Products.&nbsp;"Amid shifting interest rate expectations, Micro U.S. Treasury futures offer easier access to key 10- and 30-year benchmarks, complementing our broad risk management suite of U.S. Treasury offerings."</p>
<p>CME Group recently reported its highest-ever Q1 average daily volume of 7.8 million contracts in U.S. Treasury futures and options, an increase of 12% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Micro U.S. Treasury futures are cash-settled and one-tenth of the size of Ultra 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note futures and Ultra U.S. Treasury Bond futures. The contracts receive automatic margin offsets against existing CME Group Interest Rate futures, and are listed by, and subject to, the rules of CBOT. For more information, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4136966-1&amp;h=3746689399&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2Fmarkets%2Finterest-rates%2Fmicro-treasury-futures.html&amp;a=here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<div> Guidelines, resubmission, historical data, EBA reporting framework, financial institutions
Summary:<br /> EBA published guidelines for resubmission of historical data, ensuring accuracy and consistency in reporting framework, with precision adjustment. <br /> <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Guidelines on the resubmission of historical data under the EBA reporting framework. The Guidelines provide a common approach to the resubmission of historical data by the financial institutions to the competent and resolution authorities in case of errors, inaccuracies or other changes in the data reported, in accordance with the supervisory and resolution reporting framework developed by the EBA.</span></p>
<p>The Guidelines, issued following the recommendation included in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/supervisory-reporting/cost-compliance-supervisory-reporting">EBA Report on the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements</a><em>,&nbsp;</em>and built on the proportionality principle of the underlying reporting requirements, set out a general approach for the resubmission of historical data with the aim of limiting the number of historical periods subject to resubmission, due to errors or inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Under this general approach, financial institutions are expected to resubmit the corrected data for the current reporting date, and historical data for past reference dates, going back at least one calendar year (except for the data with monthly reporting frequency). The Guidelines also clarify the general circumstances under which the resubmission may not be required.</p>
<p>The resubmission of historical data is equally relevant for all types of financial institutions to ensure consistency of data and to allow user at competent authorities, resolution authorities and the EBA to use high quality, consistent and complete data.</p>
<p>Following the feedback received during the public consultation from May to July 2023, the EBA further clarified various provisions in the Guidelines, and adjusted the precision requirement in the EBA filing rules for monetary data from one thousand to ten thousand, which should reduce the number of resubmissions.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk163227857" name="_Hlk163227857">The new precision requirement will be applicable as of 1&nbsp;April 2025.</a></p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Guidelines are the EBA&rsquo;s response to one of the recommendations in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/supervisory-reporting/cost-compliance-supervisory-reporting">EBA Report on the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements</a>&nbsp;(recommendation 25).</p>
<p>These Guidelines aim at assisting institutions in their reporting obligations (based on various reporting acts to which they are subject to) and are not intended to change the reporting rules.</p>

<div> ASC, Notice of Hearing, market manipulation, insider reporting violations, Softlab

Summary:<br />The Alberta Securities Commission issued a Notice of Hearing against individuals for market manipulation and insider reporting violations involving Softlab securities. <div>
<p><span>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) has issued a Notice of Hearing against Calgary residents Rahim Shiraz A-K Mohamed (a.k.a. Rahim Shiraz Ali Abdul Karim Karmali Mohamed) and Alnoor Fatehali Nathoo, and British Columbia residents Marc Evan Levy and Michael Baron. The Notice of Hearing alleges that the group engaged in a market manipulation scheme and committed insider reporting violations in breach of Alberta securities laws.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>According to the Notice of Hearing, from March 2019 to November 2020, the group used their own trading accounts, as well as other accounts they controlled, to trade in shares of Softlab9 Software Solutions Inc. (Softlab), which subsequently became Softlab9 Technologies Inc., and is now known as CleanGo Innovations Inc. At the time of the alleged misconduct, Mohamed was the CEO of Softlab and Nathoo was one of its directors. ASC Staff allege the group engaged in a pattern of trading that involved market manipulation hallmarks of upticks, downticks, high closes, wash trades and bid support. These activities resulted in, or contributed to, a false or misleading appearance of trading activity or an artificial price for Softlab securities.</span><br /><br /><span>The Notice of Hearing also alleges that the parties failed to comply with insider reporting obligations, and that Levy also failed to comply with the early warning requirements triggered when he directly or indirectly accumulated over 10 per cent of Softlab&rsquo;s outstanding shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>These are allegations and have not been proven in a hearing.</span><br /><br /><span>An appearance to set a date for a hearing will be held on May 21, 2024 at 10 a.m. in the ASC Hearing Room on the 5th floor, 250 &ndash; 5 Street S.W., Calgary, Alberta.</span><br /><br /><span>A copy of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Notices-Decisions-Orders-Rulings/Enforcement/2024/04/MOHAMED-Rahim-Shiraz-AK-NOH-20240402-6124988.ashx">Notice of Hearing</a><span>&nbsp;can be found on the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.asc.ca/">ASC website</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>The ASC gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the British Columbia Securities Commission, Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers, Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws.

<title>Office Hours With Gary Gensler: U.S. Treasury Markets, SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, April 9, 2024</title>

<div> Treasury Markets, U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission, capital markets, central clearing
Summary: The U.S. Treasury Markets and the Securities and Exchange Commission are closely related. The SEC oversees the markets to ensure stability and efficiency. It recently finalized rules to bring more of the Treasury markets into central clearing, making the base of the pyramid more efficient, competitive, and resilient. This strengthens the U.S. Treasury Market and the dollar in your pocket.
 <div>
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGB6psaUqvA">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/video-transcript/gensler-office-hours-treasury-markets#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>What does the $1 bill have to do with the U.S. Treasury Markets? And what do either have to do with the Securities and Exchange Commission?</p>
<p>Well, you see, the federal government borrows from the public in two ways. One: it prints and issues that cash. In fact, look at what's on the back of the $10 bill, it's the U.S. Treasury Department. Further, it issues Treasury securities. If you pull a $1 bill out of your pocket, what do you see on the reverse? The great seal of the United States, the eagle on the right, and the pyramid on the left.</p>
<p>Well, here at the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are coming up on our 90th birthday. The design on the reverse of the current U.S. dollar, though, is more of a spring chicken. It's one year younger, established in 1935. Franklin Roosevelt had a hand in designing both this design on the back of the U.S. dollar and the SEC. Further, the two are related.</p>
<p>Our job at the SEC is to oversee the capital markets. The capital markets play an integral role in preserving the dollar as the dominant world currency, and that dominance benefits all of us. It means lower cost for borrowing, not only for the U.S. Treasury, but also for everyone else borrowing in dollars. And to preserve that dominance, the capital markets must have a safe, liquid, and reliable asset in which to invest.</p>
<p>That's where the $27 trillion Treasury markets come in. They're the base of the pyramid of our capital markets. And even the base of a pyramid can get shaky at times. We've experienced such jitters in the Treasury markets not once, not twice, many times from</p>
<p>the 1980s, all the way through when COVID broke out. And when the base of the pyramid shakes... That's not good for the capital markets, for the dollar, or for you.</p>
<p>That's why we've recently finalized a number of rules regarding the U.S. Treasury Market. And one of those relates to the market plumbing itself through something called &ldquo;central clearing.&rdquo; Such plumbing helps ensure that cash and the securities change hands in an orderly way. Clearing houses which lower risk by standing in the middle of the markets. They're the buyer to every seller, the seller to every buyer.</p>
<p>Given changes in the markets in recent decades from electronification to high frequency trading, when it comes to the U.S. Treasury Markets, only a small part of the plumbing at the base of the pyramid is being used. I know the ancients didn't have modern plumbing, but we don't want to live like the ancients.</p>
<p>Our rules will bring more of the U.S. Treasury markets into this plumbing. That makes the base of the pyramid more efficient, competitive, and resilient. In other words, more sturdy and less messy. That strengthens, not only the U.S. Treasury Market, but the dollar in your pocket.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>On 8 February 2024, ACER has received a request from the European Network System Operator for Electricity (ENTSO-E) to provide an opinion on the revised manual of procedures for its Transparency Platform.</p>
<p>Today, ACER releases its favourable opinion, attesting that ENTSO-E&rsquo;s revision of the manual of procedures should improve the Transparency Platform and overall data transparency.</p>
<p>The updated manual of procedures mainly introduces new data items to be collected and additional clarifications to improve the existing definitions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform?</span></p>
<p>The ENTSO-E&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUAQHVVlTW0xfU1FWHVZdVwAdCwsFXhoAXQoCUlIDUwUAVwgdVVBbAgEAUlYdUQ4HAh0GWwdfGlRSBgMZVwwOBwFTUgVQVABYRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Transparency Platform</a>&nbsp;aims to collect and centralise data related to electricity generation, transportation, and consumption at European level.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://siren.io/" target="_blank">Siren</a>,&nbsp;the all-in-one investigation platform company on a mission to keep people, assets and networks safe, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank">Chainalysis</a>, the blockchain intelligence platform,&nbsp;today announced details of a strategic partnership at the annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/links-nyc/" target="_blank">Chainalysis Links</a>&nbsp;event in New York. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream and used by both good and bad actors,&nbsp;the partnership addresses the increasing need for more sophisticated intelligence technology to fight illicit cryptocurrency activity.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many believe cryptocurrency is the future, and it is expected that blockchains will soon be the world&rsquo;s primary mechanism for the exchange of value. Chainalysis&rsquo; mission is to build trust in blockchains, setting the stage for the mass adoption of crypto in a way that gives participants safety and security. Its data powers investigation, compliance, and market intelligence software that has been used to solve some of the world&rsquo;s most high-profile criminal cases and grow consumer access to cryptocurrency safely.</p>
<p>Siren is an AI-driven&nbsp;<a href="https://info.siren.io/siren14" target="_blank">Investigative Intelligence platform</a>&nbsp;which is used by some of the world&rsquo;s leading Law Enforcement, National Security and Cyber threat investigators.&nbsp;Siren connects and enriches local classified information with external vendor data as well as data available from public sources to identify patterns, actors and events.</p>
<p>Siren&rsquo;s AI-driven search functionality dramatically reduces the complexity in searching for intelligence &ndash;&nbsp;like browsing the internet or shopping online anyone can search for intelligence links, regardless of technical abilities, across multiple data sources and get immediate results on both desktop and mobile devices. Using patented technology, Siren delivers a modern search experience at Enterprise speed and scale, making advanced intelligence queries accessible to all across the organization.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration,&nbsp;illicit activity is easier to identify in real-time across multiple data sources, including Chainalysis&rsquo; on-chain data,&nbsp;allowing investigators and analysts to map addresses to named services, detect illicit activity as it happens, and build cases.</p>
<p>The Siren&nbsp;<a href="https://info.siren.io/siren14" target="_blank">platform</a>&nbsp;leverages the Chainalysis Investigations API (IAPI), part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/solution/crypto-investigations" target="_blank">Chainalysis Investigations solution</a>. The Investigations API is a REST based API which programmatically helps to prioritize and accelerate investigations. This ensures investigation teams can focus on the most important cases with the highest likelihood of success. The IAPI enables data engineers and scientists to enrich existing datasets with Chainalysis insights to enhance large scale investigations, surface new leads, and uncover previously unknown connections between different cases for deconfliction.</p>
<p>John Randles, CEO of Siren, said: "Linking to crypto across multiple data sources is pivotal for investigators. We're delighted to announce the partnership here in New York at Links 2024. We were lucky to attend a couple&nbsp;of Chainalysis events last year and experience first-hand how the synergies in our offerings and missions."</p>
<p>John Randles will speak on Day Two of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/links-nyc/" target="_blank">Chainalysis Links 2024</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<b><i>Intersection of AI and Crypto&nbsp;</i></b>panel.</p>
<p>Shannon Hughes, Senior Director, Head of Business Development and Partnerships commented: "Cryptocurrency is no longer just a niche specialty for elite cyber law enforcement units &ndash; our customers find connections to crypto across national security, crime, fraud, and cyber threats. This partnership enables investigators to combine Chainalysis data with other data sources to identify intelligence signals and actionable leads across specialties. This is the future of harnessing the transparency of blockchains to build a safer economic system."</p>

<ul>
<li><span>SFT markets overview</span>: The total outstanding exposure of SFTs was EUR 9.8tn in September 2023. Repos accounted for EUR 6.7tn or 68% of the total, securities lending for EUR 2.3tn (23%), buy-sell back for EUR 743bn (8%), and margin lending for EUR 124bn (1%).&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Repo market participants</span>: Banks are the major participants in repo markets with 52% of repo amounts, and are predominantly concentrated in a few EEA jurisdictions, with France as the primary domicile holding 55% of EEA repo borrowing and 53% of EEA repo lending in September 2023. Other main countries include Germany (17% borrowing / 19% lending), Italy (7% borrowing / 5% lending) and Ireland (5% borrowing / 6% lending).&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Cross-border linkages:&nbsp;</span>41% of the repo amounts observed are between EEA counterparties. Links with the UK are strong, with EEA repo borrowing from the UK amounting to 12% of repo amounts, and EEA lending to the UK to 9%.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Clearing &amp; settlement</span>: 61% of repo transactions are uncleared, with 55% processed bilaterally and 6% managed with a third-party.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Repo collateral use</span>: Government bonds are the main collateral employed. The cleared segment predominantly makes use of EEA sovereign bonds (88% of collateral), while the non-cleared segment features slightly more collateral heterogeneity (79% of sovereign bonds as collateral).&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Repo haircuts</span>: Since CCPs collect margin at the portfolio level using proprietary risk models, cleared repos often report zero haircuts at the transaction level. This contrasts with higher haircuts in non-cleared transactions, especially when involving a more diverse pool of asset classes. Non-cleared repos backed by government bonds often display no haircut.&nbsp;</li>

<p class="text-align-justify">The Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR) created a Union-wide framework under which details of SFTs can be efficiently reported, responding to the need to enhance the transparency of securities financing markets.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>09 April 2024, London, UK</strong><span>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</span><a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/230/a1oun5fvwp7j1r3hu6hk2z837/1/9ba7d2c7b637b20cd86ecf1e4cb8cdd65898ce9e1d9b86f1d496d805a7b064f2" target="_blank">Corlytics</a><span>, the global leader in regulatory intelligence and policy compliance technology, has signed an investment from specialist growth investor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/230/a1oun5fvwp7j1r3hu6hk2z837/2/1f452a9782935f63688256a9b2a7ff31b2c4860d902dd5262cd144d94c849278" target="_blank">Verdane</a><span>&nbsp;for a majority equity stake in the company. Verdane was chosen as an investor with a proven track record of creating category leaders. Currently, Verdane has &euro;6.9BN in committed capital scaling tech-enabled growth businesses.</span></div>
<div></div>
<p>Corlytics and Verdane have partnered to support the RegTech company&rsquo;s continued growth. Verdane will leverage more than 20 years of experience partnering with European software businesses and extensive expertise in RegTech to support Corlytics. The transaction was managed by investment bank Baird in a competitive process that saw significant market interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal is a cornerstone investment from Verdane&rsquo;s newly raised &euro;1.1 billion Edda III Fund, which recognises Corlytics as a category leader and RegTech industry consolidator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driven by increasingly demanding regulatory requirements, financial services firms spent ~&euro;163 billion on their risk and compliance functions in 2023 across GRC, financial risk and capital management, cyber and IT security and financial crime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well leveraging generative AI throughout workflows, Corlytics is plugged directly into international regulators, delivering an industry-leading end-to-end compliance platform.&nbsp;Corlytics is the only solution that enables clients to align with, and stay ahead of, regulatory demands, which now include growing levels of proof of compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corlytics continues to invest heavily in innovation, with Group investments in R&amp;D exceeding &euro;50 million to date. Working with leading industry data science research centres and academics, the company is developing next-generation AI and machine learning technology. Replacing clunky software that is helping firms to find, interpret and understand and then implement (FIUI) complex regulations. Corlytics precision FIUI regulatory technology, is building intelligence into the regulatory content itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Leading GRC and regtech analyst and commentator Michael Rasmussen said:</em><span>&nbsp;</span><span>"I've observed firsthand the myriad challenges organizations face in managing regulatory change and keeping their policies and controls current. With regulatory landscapes evolving unprecedentedly, traditional methods are increasingly inadequate. This is where the transformative power of AI and regtech becomes evident in GRC. Corlytics, with this investment, is positioned to continue its leadership in this revolution. By leveraging AI, they're not just streamlining compliance processes but reinventing them, delivering unparalleled value in efficiency, effectiveness, resilience, and agility. Verdane's investment in nurturing tech-enabled growth is a testament to Corlytics' potential to redefine regulatory compliance processes. It propels Corlytics to be a partner of choice for organizations grappling with the complexities of modern regulatory demands. This partnership marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a more resilient and agile regulatory compliance landscape."</span></p>
<p>Since 2020, Corlytics has grown 60% per annum, predominantly driven by its core regulatory compliance products. The number of Corlytics customers has roughly doubled during this period. 2023 also saw Corlytics make two significant acquisitions &ndash; ING SparQ in January and Clausematch in July &ndash; creating&nbsp;an unparalleled platform that manages the entire regulatory risk value chain on a global scale, elevating Corlytics&rsquo; extensive offer for Tier 1 organisations including ING, BNY Mellon, ScotiaBank and SwissRe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Corlytics is relied upon by 40% of the top 30 Systematically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI). Those that are recognised as&nbsp;<span>a bank, insurance, or other financial institution (FI) that U.S. federal regulators determine would pose a serious risk to the economy if it were to collapse. A SIFI is viewed as &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; and imposed with extra regulatory burdens to prevent it from going under.</span></p>
<p>Corlytics continues to be an industry pacesetter, from its work developing intelligent regulations and taxonomies with regulators such as the FCA, to its acquisitions of key policy management technologies of ING&rsquo;s SPARQ and Clausematch last year. It is the regulatory technology partner of choice for the world&rsquo;s largest financial services firms, enabling them to simply comply and implement ever changing regulations.</p>
<p>John Byrne, Corlytics&rsquo; founder and CEO, commented<span>, &ldquo;Corlytics has successfully progressed in developing new products to further improve our value proposition to Tier 1 clients globally. This investment from Verdane ensures the continued growing market leadership for Corlytics. We look forward to partnering with the Verdane team and with their experience and expertise, we expect to accelerate organic growth and augment that with M&amp;A activity. As well as investing significantly in our &lsquo;intelligent content&rsquo; offering, combining data, software and AI, we will continue to lead the RegTech sector consolidation with more complementary acquisitions, following our recent transactions with Clausematch and ING SparQ.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><em>Nils Vold, Partner at Verdane, commented</em><span>,&nbsp;&ldquo;Verdane is delighted to back John and his impressive team at Corlytics. This is a centrepiece majority investment from our newly raised &euro;1.1 billion Edda III Fund and we are thrilled that John and Corlytics chose to partner with Verdane against very strong market interest in the business. We are an active and experienced investor in the RegTech sector and we identified Corlytics as the global category leader in its field, helping banks and financial services companies manage their compliance obligations in a complex and fast-changing environment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>Sebastian Wintgens, Principal at Verdane, added</em><span>,&nbsp;&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Corlytics and look forward to leveraging our expertise in helping European software leaders to grow, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, as well as bringing our international industry networks to help Corlytics continue to thrive and succeed as it expands globally.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>As part of the Verdane investment and partnership, Corlytics is pleased to announce an expansion of its board of directors, adding further expertise to support the company&rsquo;s growth plans.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Simon Russell joins Corlytics as Chair. He has almost 30 years of software advisory expertise. Over the last 15 years, Simon led technology investment banking at firms including Nomura and Dresdner Kleinwort and he served on banking management committees. He now works as a Chair and Non-Executive Director at various international software companies.</span></p>
<p><em>Simon Russell, new Chair at Corlytics, said</em><span>, &ldquo;I have long admired Corlytics as a real RegTech industry leader. I am delighted to be partnering with John and Verdane to create value through an active acquisition agenda, plus providing Corlytics with wider support on delivering its ambitious growth plans.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Trintech founder Cyril McGuire will continue to serve on the Corlytics board as a Non-Executive Director and his Infinity Capital Fund has also invested for a minority equity stake in the company.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Collaboration, Road, Worldline, EV charging, payment processing
Summary:<br />Road and Worldline collaborate to offer an integrated payment solution for European charge point owners, ensuring compliance with payment requirements and enhancing user experience. <div>
<p>A new collaboration between Road and Worldline [Euronext: WLN] creates a powerful solution for charge point owners that addresses payment processing, and administrative and compliance requirements all together. A first of its kind in the European market, this collaboration allows charge point owners to use one convenient platform to ensure compliance with <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/afir-eu-april2023/">AFIR</a> payment requirements, which come into effect on 13 April 2024, along with the UK&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-public-charge-point-regulations-2023-guidance/public-charge-point-regulations-2023-guidance">Public Charge Point Regulations 2023</a>, which imposes new obligations from November this year.</p>
<p>As a leading electric vehicle charging transaction and management platform, Road chose to&nbsp; partner with Worldline, a global leader in payments services to reduce complexity for charge point owners while offering convenience for EV drivers. Road will leverage its integration with Worldline to accept a range of payment methods and provide price clarity.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the importance of interconnectivity in the electric vehicle market, the solution aims to meet the growing demand of drivers and charge point owners. Road is delivering the integration to Worldline&rsquo;s payments solution to provide flexibility in accepting different cards, payment terminals and enhanced services to their customers. Road&rsquo;s extended capabilities on their E-Flux platform now creates a single view of charging sessions for charge point owner customers, including roaming, and regardless of payment method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partnering with a payment services provider like Worldline allows us to offer a smooth, hassle-free payment process. Drivers can easily pay for charging services using their preferred payment method, whether through credit or debit cards, or mobile payments, enhancing the overall user experience. And charge point owners don&rsquo;t have to deal with negotiating or setting up the payment solutions infrastructure themselves, we take care of that,&rdquo; states Vincent van Vaalen, Road&rsquo;s CEO.</p>
<p>According to Van Vaalen, the partnership will give charge point owners and drivers a seamless connection to Worldline&rsquo;s services for end-to-end card acquiring and processing. &ldquo;The flexibility of this payment solution is another step in our mission to make EV charging transactions effortless for everyone. We saw a need for simplified and integrated payment services that meet the evolving needs of the market, regardless of the size of the charge point owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While regulation is pushing a deadline, we&rsquo;ve seen fresh demand that is pushing growth.&nbsp; Whether it is consumers or businesses with fleets, offering a wider range of payment options brings more value, choice, and flexibility to the market. This is a major step to bringing a simple payment method, transparent pricing and connected services to any business offering charging services,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Radu-Vasile Pop, Head of EV Charging at Worldline said: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s e-mobility landscape requires agility, and an ecosystem that can easily adapt to the rapid pace of innovation and regulation also when it comes to the payment functionalities. We are pleased to be able to bring our payment processing capabilities to Road&rsquo;s dynamic platform. Extensive payment solutions through our collaboration will create tremendous value for drivers and charge point owners across Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solution will be available for charging stations across Europe starting in April 2024 to enable charge point owners to comply with the EU AFIR regulation.</p>

<title>The SILC Group Partners With Tokeny To Pilot Alternative Assets Through Tokenization</title>

<div> tokenization, blockchain, alternative assets, institutional involvement, compliance<br />
Summary:<br />
SILC partners with Tokeny for blockchain tokenization of alternative assets. A pilot project aims to automate compliance and improve efficiency. <div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><span><a href="https://silcgroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The SILC Group</a>&nbsp;(SILC), a leading alternative assets solutions provider based in Australia with more than $2 billion in funds under supervision, announced today it will partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading institutional tokenization solution provider. Together, they aim to realize SILC&rsquo;s ambitious digitalization vision by upgrading alternative assets onto blockchain through tokenization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The collaboration begins with a pilot project aimed at tokenizing a test fund using Tokeny&rsquo;s unique tokenization infrastructure. The pilot project will assess the potential of blockchain to ultimately replace the various legacy centralized systems that are used to administer funds used by SILC to unite investors and capital seekers within the alternative assets industry.</span></p>
<p><span>By combining both parties&rsquo; deep expertise, it is intended they will be able to offer the compliant tokenization of alternative assets in Australia and across the region, by delivering institutional-grade solutions in the issuance and lifecycle management of real-world asset tokens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The announcement marks a transformative step within the alternative assets industry as institutional involvement across blockchain begins to ramp up and significant players enter the market. The traditional way of issuing financial products is time-consuming, multi-tiered and involves many steps using cumbersome systems and processes. Through blockchain technology, parties can benefit from using one single and global infrastructure that can compliantly improve transaction speeds, utilize automation, and is accessible 24/7/365 days a year.</span></p>
<p><span>By using the ERC-3643 token smart contract standard, SILC will have the ability to automate compliance validation processes and control real-world asset tokens while preserving typical features of a blockchain like immutability and interoperability.</span></p>

<title>Derivatives Service Bureau Releases Details Of Industry Readiness For UPI Reporting In The EU - UPI Reporting In The EU Commences On 29 April 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> EMIR Refit Regulations, UPI reporting, OTC ISIN, DSB user onboarding, EU UPI implementation<br />
Summary: The DSB released data on industry readiness for EU UPI reporting. European firms are prepared, and the UPI Service has seen over 1 million UPIs created. Onboarding platform available. Event on upcoming EU UPI reporting. <br /> <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for Over the Counter (OTC) derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today released the latest data on industry readiness for European UPI (Unique Product Identifier) regulatory reporting requirements, which are part of the EU EMIR Refit Regulations.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The European Union will implement UPI reporting from 29 April 2024 as the second G20 jurisdiction, following the US who went live from 29 January 2024, and ahead of the UK effective date in September 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The EU UPI reporting will be complementary to the existing ISIN for OTC derivative reporting, which is important to price transparency and market abuse detection under MiFIR, and for aggregating OTC derivatives data under EMIR. This means that the EU (and the UK) will be reporting the OTC ISIN where the EMIR scope aligns with MiFIR, with the UPI being reportable for those derivatives that are part of the broader scope of EMIR.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the intentionally complementary design of the two identifiers, UPI data attributes and the UPI code itself are included in the OTC ISIN record. Organisations using the OTC ISIN can leverage established workflows and connectivity for integration of the UPI, ensuring global convergence and harmonisation. This is an integral component of the EU&rsquo;s approach, designed to establish cross-regulation consistency and lower reporting burdens for firms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Overall, the DSB user onboarding data reveals that European organisations are prepared to meet their UPI regulatory requirements, having seen a steady increase in EU headquartered firms joining the service. Currently, 246 firms have subscribed to the UPI Service across various fee-paying user types, including 122 programmatic users. This represents an increase of over 100 organisations subscribing to the UPI Service since the US compliance date. Among these organisations, Banks constitute the largest entity group at 44%, with other participants such as Trade Execution Platforms- SEF, Clearing Houses, Brokerages, Trade Repositories, and Data Management Providers also onboarded. Approximately 33% of the onboarded organisations have their headquarters based in the EU. Quarterly updates on UPI user numbers are available on the DSB website&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.anna-dsb.com%2Fupi-fee-model-variables%2F/1/0102018ec1a7f39c-979f8093-0830-401b-a540-64e8d8a9d895-000000/k2FYT7npeeuqrndm4TSyS8uiIcM=368" target="_blank"><span>Fee Model Variables page</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB</strong>, said:<br /><span>&ldquo;This second UPI compliance milestone reflects the momentum of G20 jurisdictions fulfilling commitments made after the financial crisis, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance global systemic risk monitoring through the aggregation of OTC derivatives data.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We have worked closely with stakeholders to ensure the OTC ISIN design is consistent and complementary with the UPI. As a result, the relationship between the two identifiers is being leveraged for the EU UPI implementation to ease integration and reduce the regulatory reporting burden on firms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>As UPI reporting deadlines approach, firms can prepare for their reporting obligations by using the DSB&rsquo;s scalable Client Onboarding and Support Platform. The platform enables timely onboarding to the UPI Service offering a range of efficient connectivity and service options that facilitate seamless access to UPIs across all products.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The UPI Service was launched on 16 October 2023 as a result of ongoing collaborative efforts involving industry stakeholders, global regulatory bodies, and the Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), which serves as the UPI Service Provider. Since its launch, more than 1 million Unique Product Identifiers (UPIs) have been created and made accessible to users</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>UPIs are categorised by asset class, with volumes regularly reported.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The next jurisdiction to roll out UPI reporting will be the UK on 30 September 2024, followed by Australia and Singapore from 21 October 2024 and Japan from 7 April 2025. In addition,&nbsp;the Hong Kong authorities, HKMA and SFC, are consulting on the OTC derivatives reporting regime, proposing mandatory UPI reporting from 29 September 2025.<br /><br />To discuss the upcoming EU UPI reporting mandate, the DSB's Managing Director, Emma Kalliomaki will be hosting a virtual event with representatives from The European Markets and Securities Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The event will take place on 10 April 2024 at 2pm UTC/ 3pm CET / 4pm EET.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<title>SET Market Report For March 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-march-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-march-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> economic growth, monetary policy, labor market, Chinese economy, stock market
<br />
SET Index rose 0.5% in March, while foreign investors sold Thai shares. China's economy rebound boosts domestic consumption and related businesses' profits.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Economic growth outlook is uncertain. Monetary policy remains divergent. Labor market remains robust. Chinese economy rebounds. Stock market sees foreign outflows. <div>
<p>The global economic growth deceleration is looming, but it has not yet entered a recession. Monetary policy divergence is apparent after inflation has not been eased as much as expected. According to the latest US labor market's readings, non-farm payroll is still healthy while unemployment rate remains at a low level, resulting in the slower-than-expected decline in inflation. Even though Federal Reserve (Fed) sees rate cuts on the horizon, investors are increasingly concerned that Fed pivot could be delayed and the baht&rsquo;s downside bias remains intact, accordingly. Moreover, offshore fund outflows from equity market, particularly big-cap stocks, are expected to continue but small to mid-cap stocks are increasingly catching investors&rsquo; eyes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President </b><b>Soraphol Tulayasathien</b><b> </b>said that<b> </b>the Chinese National People's Congress in March set a 5 percent economic growth target for the year 2024.<b> </b>China's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in March expanded to 50.8 from 49.1 in February, beating analysts' forecasts and reaching the highest level since March 2023, which was the period after the strict COVID-19 measures were lifted. Rebound of the world&rsquo;s second largest economy will come as a boon to Thailand&rsquo;s export and service sectors, helping the domestic consumption recover at a faster pace. Consequently, analysts started to raise profit forecasts of related businesses and their share prices yielded higher returns than the market&rsquo;s average.</p>
<h4><b>Key highlights for March</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>At the end of March 2024, SET Index rose by 0.5 percent from the previous month to close at 1,377.94 points, moving in line with the regional peers. However, the benchmark fell 2.7 percent from the end of 2023.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>In March, industry groups that outpaced SET Index when compared with the end of 2023 were Consumer Products, Services, Financials, and Resources.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in March 2024 dropped 30.2 percent from a year earlier to THB 42.78 billion (approx. USD 1.17 billion). Foreign investors turned to sell Thai shares with a net THB 41.24 billion in the month, constituting their net sales of THB 68.86 billion for the three months to March. Foreign investors&rsquo; trading ratio was higher than any other types of investors for 23 consecutive months.<b></b></li>
<li>In March 2024, there was a newly SET-listed company: Bangkok Genomics Innovation pcl (BKGI).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of March 2024 was 14.6 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.5 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 16.7 times, surpassing the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 15.5 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of March 2024 was 3.30 percent, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 3.23 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Derivatives Market</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in March 2024 averaged 499,897 contracts, surging 26.9 percent from the previous month largely due to the increase in trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first quarter of 2024. TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume fell 27.5 percent from the preceding year to 432,895 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<div> launch, Women in Clearing Series, Isabella Tirri, career development, clearing landscape
<br />
The article features Isabella Tirri, Manager of Post Trade Regulation at Euronext Clearing, sharing insights on career development and the future of clearing.
<br /><br />Summary: Following the successful launch of the Women in Clearing Series, Isabella Tirri shares insights on career development and the future of clearing. <div>
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b>a year ago, in March 2024 we launched&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series</b>, an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>This month, we feature &nbsp;<b>Isabella Tirri</b>, Manager of Post Trade Regulation of Euronext Clearing, part of the Euronext group, a multi-asset clearing house, provides proven risk management capabilities on several EU markets, across a range of trading venues including Euronext Milan, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin, Lisbon, MTS, BrokerTec, clearing ETFs, Closed end Funds, Financial Derivatives, Commodities (Agricultural &amp; Energy) and Fixed income (Cash and Repos markets).</p>
<p>Isabella has kindly shared the following insights about her career journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a background as a capital markets lawyer, a profession where you need to have a well-organised and analytical mindset, where attention to details is key. Especially in the past, I was the type of person who had the tendency to over-prepare before meetings or presentations and sometimes ended-up in being overly self-critical.</p>
<p>Over time, I learnt to let go of the idea that you are always need to do everything perfectly, and I realised that often, people around you are not always necessarily more knowledgeable than you are in a certain field.</p>
<p>A second aspect on which I worked on, is to try different things and to get out of my comfort zone. I learned to be less reluctant to embark on new and ambitious projects, even if they relate to areas which are outside my field of expertise. Challenging projects should be turned into an opportunity to expand your knowledge, work with new people and ultimately to grow.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, I would suggest to younger professionals to always strive to do an extra effort beyond what it is requested by your supervisor. In other words, I recommend not to limit yourself in completing the task which has been conferred to you, but to possibly try to analyse it into a broader context, and of course do not be afraid to ask for clarifications to your colleagues.</p>
<p>My other advice, would be to have a curious and learning attitude, which should be an aspect to be continuously deployed, in particular in light of the complex and fast pacing-environment we are working on.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCPs are independent risk managers and the benefits associated with counterparty risk management will remain central to financial market stability. In terms of key trends in the clearing landscape over the next decade, I see three main areas: (i) regulatory scrutiny;&nbsp; (ii) continuous focus on operational resilience and (iii) the deployment of technology advancement on operational processes.</p>
<p>On regulation, I believe CCPs will continue to remain at the centre of the regulatory agenda for different reasons. First, the need to ensure cross border supervision of CCPs being active in different markets and the need to ensure financial stability and operational resilience, which is the second aspect where I see there will be a steady attention from different stakeholders.</p>
<p>Operational resilience is critical to ensuring the effective functioning of CCPs and the risk of cyber-attacks are ever-present and evolving threat. CCPs will need to continue to enhancing capabilities and processes for mitigating the risk and impact of cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Lastly, I believe that technological innovation will have the potential to impact the type and nature of products that CCPs will clear (directly or indirectly referenced in products) and that new technologies also have the potential to optimise existing operational and risk management processes at CCPs.</p>

<title>Filling The Gap: Comments On The Proposal To Amend FINRA’s Codes Of Arbitration Procedure And Code Of Mediation Procedure To Modify The Qualifications For Representatives In Arbitrations And Mediations, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, April 8, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, law student clinics, representation, small claims, FINRA rule change<br />
Summary:<br />
The SEC is seeking public input on a proposed FINRA rule change regarding representation of investors in securities arbitrations and mediations. Topics include the role of law student clinics, the impact on small claims investors, and potential alternatives to the proposed rule change. <div>
<p>Several weeks ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission hosted a seminar for law student clinics that represent investors in securities arbitrations and mediations. These students fill a very important void by serving investors, particularly those with relatively small claims, who might not otherwise be able to find representation in disputes with their brokers. Perhaps the impressive students who spoke at the event will inspire other law schools to start such clinics.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Too few of these clinics exist now, however, to meet the demand for representation in securities arbitrations. The void of representation for investors with low-dollar claims remains particularly acute. A proposed FINRA rule could exacerbate the problem by preventing non-lawyers from getting compensated to represent investors in arbitration proceedings. Today, the Commission opened a thirty-day period for interested parties to file statements supporting or opposing this change. I urge the public to help us think about whether this rule is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>FINRA cites a number of reasons for the rule change. First, FINRA points to instances of poor representation by paid non-lawyers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;but it is unclear whether the frequency of such instances justifies a rule change.&nbsp;<i>I invite the public to provide additional context by providing examples of low- and high-quality representation by paid no-lawyer representatives.&nbsp;</i>FINRA contends that combining compensation with no attorney-like regulatory framework is a recipe for poor representation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;<i>Does the public agree, or would reputational concerns be sufficient to produce good representation by compensated non-lawyer representatives?</i>&nbsp;FINRA also points out that sometimes its arbitrators throw out the claims of an investor who is represented by a compensated non-lawyer on the grounds that the person is represented by someone engaged illegally in the practice of law.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;<i>Should FINRA, instead of adopting a prohibition on non-lawyers getting paid to represent investors, prohibit its arbitrators from taking on the role of enforcing state laws with respect to the practice of law?</i>&nbsp;Some states have made it clear that they consider representing someone in an arbitration proceeding for compensation to be the practice of law, and other states could do so.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;<i>Does FINRA need to step in to prohibit conduct that is already under scrutiny in some states?</i></p>
<p>FINRA acknowledges that investors with small claims may not be able to find representation after the rule is in place.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;<i>Do commenters agree that small dollar claimants will have a more difficult time getting help?</i>&nbsp;<i>If so, is the protection afforded by the change worth the cost to a segment of investors that may most need assistance? Will the net effect of this change be to harm market quality by cutting off one avenue for harmed investors to get help?</i></p>
<p>FINRA&rsquo;s proposal would codify the ability of law students, working with a licensed lawyer, to represent investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-finra-04082024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;This explicit recognition of the important role that law students can and do play could inspire other law schools to start similar clinics. I look forward to hearing from commenters on this point as well. While most students who go through such a clinic may not end up representing investors in disputes after they graduate and pass the bar, some will.&nbsp;<i>Do commenters agree that such clinics could help to increase the ranks of representatives for investors with disputes not only by explicitly recognizing that students can work on these matters, but by creating a pool of lawyers with relevant experience gained as students serving in these clinics?</i></p>

<div> Eka Software Solutions, acquisition, STG, Quor Group, commodities trade and risk management <br />
Summary:
STG acquires Eka, merging with Quor to provide CTRM solutions, leveraging innovation, broadening offerings, and accelerating industry growth.
 <div>
<p>STG, a US-based private equity firm focused on software and software-enabled tech services companies, announces the strategic acquisition of Eka Software Solutions (&ldquo;Eka&rdquo;), a global provider of commodity management solutions with a specialty in the soft ags and energies markets. For nearly two decades, Eka has been providing commodities trade and risk management (&ldquo;CTRM&rdquo;) and supply chain solutions, consistently delivering innovation to its customers while building a robust and modern vertical SaaS platform.</p>
<p>STG will merge Eka with the Quor Group (&ldquo;Quor&rdquo;), an existing STG portfolio company that specializes in CTRM offerings within the metals ecosystem. The combination of Eka and Quor is a material step forward for the CTRM industry, providing a broad software suite that addresses a spectrum of customer needs across asset classes globally.</p>
<p>Eka, leveraging its innovative approach and cutting-edge technology, joins Quor to provide the combined entity&rsquo;s customers with a broad ability to navigate the complexities of the commodity markets, including increasing end market volatility and customers&rsquo; desire to hedge their corresponding risk profile. Together, Quor and Eka are poised to address customers&rsquo; greatest needs, accelerate innovation, and set new benchmarks within the industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been extremely impressed by the breadth and depth of the products that make up the Eka platform. Their CTRM / ETRM and supply chain products have consistently delivered for their impressive customer base&rdquo; said William Chisholm, Managing Partner of STG. "We are committed to supporting Quor and Eka through further investments in innovation with the ultimate goal of continuing to provide exceptional value to their clients,&rdquo; added Ishan Manaktala, Operating Partner at STG.</p>
<p>Manav Garg, founder and CEO of Eka, will continue to play a pivotal role in guiding the vision and strategic direction of the combined company as a Board Advisor. His industry insight and leadership will be invaluable as Quor embarks on its next phase of growth. Manav comments, &ldquo;the merger could not happen at a more opportune time &ndash; we have seen increased volatility across asset classes, greater desire of customers to hedge their risk, and substantial supply chain disruption; all of which leaves the market yearning for solutions from Eka and Quor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve Hughes, CEO of Quor, commented on the strategic synergies, stating, "I believe joining forces with Eka is a game-changer for us and our customers. I am keen to partner with Manav and his decades of knowledge to drive the CTRM industry forward into a new era of growth and success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferies LLC acted as financial advisor and DLA acted as legal advisor to STG. Tree Line Capital Partners provided debt financing to support the acquisition.</p>

<div> GPWB-CENTR, regional index, GPW Benchmark, net income formula, stock exchanges
Summary:
GPW Benchmark launched GPWB-CENTR, a regional index covering 7 stock exchanges. It calculates net income, includes 119 companies, and is revised annually. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>GPW Benchmark started publishing the new regional index GPWB-CENTR</span></li>
<li><span>The new index covers companies from the stock exchanges in Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Ljubljana, Prague, Warsaw and Zagreb</span></li>
<li><span>GPWB-CENTR is the first index published by GPW Benchmark in the net income formula</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPW Benchmark has started publishing the new regional index GPWB-CENTR. GPWB-CENTR is the first index published by GPW Benchmark in the net income formula, which means that its calculation takes into account not only the prices of individual instruments participating in the index portfolio, but also net dividend income, i.e. after deducting tax, in accordance with the principles taxation of legal persons having their registered office or management in Poland on the terms specified in the index&nbsp;<em><a href="https://gpwbenchmark.pl/pub/BENCHMARK/files/indeksy-gieldowe-regulacje/en/Rules_GPWB-CENTR_5.04.2024.pdf" target="_blank">rules</a></em>, as well as income from pre-emptive rights, bonus shares and other income.</p>
<p>The base date of the index is March 28 this year, and the index value on that day was set at 1,000 points. Subsequent index values are published once a day after 6:30 p.m. and made available on the GPW Benchmark website. On April 5, the index value was 1,011.24 points.</p>
<p>The new index covers the largest companies with high liquidity from the stock exchanges in Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Ljubljana, Prague, Warsaw and Zagreb. According to the method, companies whose average turnover per session exceeds EUR 90,000 may qualify for the index. The share of a single company on the ranking date will be limited to 10% and the total share of companies whose share exceeds 5% cannot be greater than 40%. Index revisions will be carried out once a year after the last session in June. Currently, the GPWB-CENTR index portfolio includes 119 companies.</p>
<p><span><span>The launch of new indices, including regional indices, is an element of cooperation with entities using reference indices in response to their needs and market trends.</span></span></p>

<div> Academic Advisory Group, CBDC, Central Bank, Digital Pound, Payments Landscape
Summary:<br /><br />Central Bank Digital Currency Academic Advisory Group meeting discusses future of money, behavioral drivers of payment intentions, risks and opportunities of CBDCs, potential scenarios in payment landscape, and promoting a mixed payments ecosystem. <div>
<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>Date: 19 March 2024</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome</h3>
<p>Neeraj Patel (co-chair, HM Treasury) welcomed members to the first meeting of the CBDC Academic Advisory Group. He reminded members that the agreed meeting format would comprise three presentations from members, followed by a facilitated discussion. The chairs invited members to present.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: The Future of Money and Payments &ndash; Presentation by Dr Iwa Salami</h3>
<p>Dr Iwa Salami presented on the role of the central bank in maintaining financial and monetary stability, as well as governance of CBDC models and accountability.</p>
<p>Members discussed whether financial inclusion should be a primary policy driver for CBDC. They also discussed the role of Payment Interface Providers (PIPs) in the digital pound ecosystem, including their regulatory framework. The Bank noted the regulatory framework for a digital pound had not been identified, but this might be an area on which members can provide useful expertise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Behavioural Drivers of Payment Intentions: UK Survey Evidence &ndash; Presentation by Professor Darren Duxbury</h3>
<p>Professor Darren Duxbury presented a study of behavioural drivers of cash usage preferences, including the implications for work on a digital pound. In discussion, members asked about the methodology behind his research and the role of cash in the future. One member suggested that further research could explore how behavioural factors may affect adoption of any future digital pound.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4: The Risks and Opportunities of Central Bank Digital Currencies &ndash; Presentation by Professor Bill Buchanan OBE</h3>
<p>Professor Bill Buchanan OBE presented on the risks and opportunities of CBDCs from a technology perspective. He addressed the role of AI, quantum, cybersecurity, and programmable payments. Members discussed how different forms of technology such as distributed ledger technology or digital identities may change the role of banking and finance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Item 5: Roundtable discussion</h3>
<p>The co-chairs thanked the three presenters and opened the discussion for the next part of the meeting. The chairs noted that our work on a digital pound is just one part of the Government and Bank of England&rsquo;s efforts to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of innovation in money, payments, and digital finance. The chairs asked members to consider what role a digital pound could play set against the changes being experienced, and expected to occur in the future, in the payments landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Item 5.1: Discussion point &ndash; How should we identify and assess the potential scenarios of the future payments landscape?</h3>
<p>Members discussed the timeframes over which potential scenarios may be considered. Some timeframes are focused on the payments landscape, but longer timeframes may need to consider wider societal changes. For example, members discussed the possibility of digital assets becoming more commonly used than money within 30 years. Members cautioned on the reliance of studying previous trends as an indication of future trends.</p>
<p>Members had a range of views on tokenisation and its role in a future economy. One member expressed the possible need for a digital pound to maintain financial stability, in the event that many assets became tokenised.</p>
<p>One member outlined their thinking on the role of a digital pound as an anchor. They summarised that it was important for the implementation of monetary policy that the pound remained the unit of account for the United Kingdom. While it was thought to be unlikely this would be threatened, it is possible that if different types of money are created and denominated in sterling, then the fungibility of money may be lost. While a digital pound may not be needed in the immediate term, there are scenarios where having a digital pound is prudent.</p>
<p>Many members considered cybersecurity as an important future consideration, alongside the rights of citizens. They noted that legislation was being considered globally in this context, and one member discussed how a PIP might be managing these risks. They noted that while larger financial institutions have the capabilities to run large teams dedicated to security of accounts, smaller firms may not be able to match this.</p>
<p>Members also discussed the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in any future scenarios, and the interactions between SMEs and larger corporates &ndash; particularly how SMEs could be affected by cybersecurity risk and security failings that could occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Item 5.2: Discussion point &ndash; What does a &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; payments ecosystem look like in steady state? How can we best promote this in our design choices?</h3>
<p>Members felt that there was relatively little widespread public understanding of the different forms of money, and that the current payments landscape is both complex and in parts largely invisible to end users. Members noted that future use cases for new forms of money may make it easier for end users to differentiate between them. They noted that wider engagement with SMEs and individuals on a broad range of payment issues could support this.</p>
<p>Members discussed how payments trends are increasingly driven by the transaction context, rather than the method. Members recommended considering how the scenarios in which payments occur may change, and how this might drive change in the payment needs of individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>Members discussed how end users are typically engaged with technology projects and asked how the Bank and HM Treasury foresaw the use of pilot testing. The chair noted pilot testing would occur as part of any future build stage, in the event a decision was taken to build a digital pound.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7">Item 5.3: Discussion point &ndash; How might current trends in payment technology inform us on future adoption of a new forms of money?</h3>
<p>Members discussed the respective roles of the public and private sector. For example, members discussed the public sector&rsquo;s role in providing a safe and reliable means of payment, like cash. One member noted the important role a digital pound could play in supporting financial inclusion. Members considered how the private sector could harness new technologies to develop innovative payments features, that individuals and businesses may wish to use. Members also discussed possible use cases for a digital pound, noting micropayments as a potential area of interest. One member pointed out that the idea of micropayments has been around for a long time and suggested looking at different uptake levels globally to understand it further.</p>
<p>One member raised the link between financial inclusion and digital inclusion, noting that cash use doesn&rsquo;t require digital literacy. They highlighted the importance of the Government legislation to support access to cash to maintain a mixed payment system.</p>
<p>Members considered the role of incumbent actors in the payments landscape, citing their brand recognition and existing customer base as a potential barrier to a digital pound. The chairs highlighted that the current payments landscape has many benefits but noted that there was still some scope to improve the experience for consumers and merchants. Members also discussed the risk of bank runs and the extent to which people might transfer deposits from commercial banks to a digital pound.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-8">Item 6: AOB and close</h3>
<p>The co-chairs thanked members for a wide-ranging discussion. They explained that the next meeting would be focused on privacy and trust and invited members to consider if they would wish to present.</p>

<title>7th Exchange Of The Year Title Awarded To LuxSE</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/7th-exchange-of-the-year-title-awarded-to-luxse/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/7th-exchange-of-the-year-title-awarded-to-luxse/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>For the seventh time since 2017, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) has been named &lsquo;Exchange of the Year&rsquo; at Environmental Finance&rsquo;s Sustainable Debt Awards 2024. This year, the exchange was recognised for its trailblazing work in emerging markets and gender finance through its leading platform for sustainable finance, the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX). </b></p>
<p>Today marked the release of Environmental Finance&rsquo;s Sustainable Debt Awards winner's list for 2024. Previously known as the Environmental Finance Bond Awards, every year, this initiative seeks to recognise institutions that excel, innovate, and contribute to the successful development of the sustainable debt market. The winners of the different categories are recognised for their thought-leadership, best practice, and innovative initiatives in the field of sustainable finance throughout 2023.</p>
<p>After an important year of strengthening sustainable finance in emerging markets and advancing financing for gender equality, LuxSE was named &lsquo;Exchange of the Year&rsquo; for its work in these important areas of sustainable development. This makes the exchange a 7-time winner of Environmental Finance&rsquo;s debt-related &lsquo;Exchange of the Year&rsquo; title since 2017.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Contributing to closing the gaps in financing for sustainable development in emerging markets and gender equality were key drivers for the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in 2023, shaping many of the initiatives we implemented, the securities we displayed and cooperations that we entered into. Addressing these gaps will play a key role in defining whether the goals set out in the Paris Agreement and by the UN SDGs are met or missed and so it is an honour to have our efforts in these areas recognised once more by Environmental Finance,&rdquo; said Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</i></p>
<h4><b>Advancing financing for women</b></h4>
<p>Throughout 2023, LuxSE continued to foster awareness of the importance of gender finance and gender-lens investing by releasing a number of important resources in the market &ndash; including a market study entitled <a href="https://www.luxse.com/discover-lgx/sustainable-securities-on-lgx/gender-focused-bonds/gender-finance-study">&lsquo;Linking gender and finance: An overview of the gender-focused bond market&rsquo;</a> and a 2-hour LGX Academy module on <a href="https://www.luxse.com/discover-lgx/additional-lgx-services/lgx-academy/gender-finance">&lsquo;How capital markets contribute to the growth of gender finance&rsquo;</a>. In the module&rsquo;s first session in the summer of 2023, 50 participants gained a deeper understanding of the scope and state of the gender-focused bond market and how they can contribute to improving gender equality through their financial strategies and investment decisions.</p>
<p>LuxSE continues to flag gender-focused bonds displayed on LGX, to make it easier for investors to identify investment opportunities which contribute to gender equality goals. At year end, there were more than 60 gender-focused bonds on LGX, including the first gender bond from Sub-Saharan Africa issued by NMB Bank Plc in Tanzania, providing up to 3,000 women in Tanzania with access to the financing needed to start or grow their own business.</p>
<h4><b>Focus on emerging markets</b></h4>
<p>In 2023, LuxSE entered into new and complementary cooperation agreements with counterparts in emerging markets such as Chongwa (Macao) Financial Asset Exchange Co., Ltd (MOX), China Everbright Bank, the Abu Dhabi Exchange, and Bolsa de Valores de Cabo Verde (BVC) to advance the sustainable finance agenda in new regions.</p>
<p>Education also remained a key focus for LuxSE&rsquo;s sustainable finance experts, with LGX Academy trainings taking place in China, the Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka. LuxSE also co-organised the International Finance Corporation (IFC)&rsquo;s 3-day Green Bond Technical Assistance Programme (GB TAP) named Green, Social and Sustainability (GSS) Bonds Executive Programme in Luxembourg in November 2023, which gathered almost 30 senior bankers from about 20 different emerging economies with the objective of fostering the supply of sustainable bonds in new markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LGX DataHub, LuxSE&rsquo;s sustainable bond database, also continued to gain international recognition and was used as a data source by leading institutions such as the <a href="https://www.luxse.com/about-us/press-center/904fe7ab-b2ab-40a9-8268-2fd8c48f74b7___ICMA-launches-new-sustainable-bond-database-powered-by-the-LGX-DataHub-">International Capital Market Association (ICMA)</a> and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p>
<h4><b>Reaching the first trillion</b></h4>
<p>As of 31 December 2023, LGX encompassed 1,874 green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds from 309 issuers in 59 countries, totalling EUR 977+ billion in funding for sustainable development throughout the world. This included a total of 554 new GSSS bonds on LGX in 2023, raising a total of EUR 207 billion.</p>
<p>In February 2024, LGX reached its largest milestone to date &ndash; counting EUR 1 trillion worth of outstanding GSSS bonds on the platform.</p>

<ul>
<li> Adds Corporates as Fourth Client Channel for Tradeweb Alongside Institutional, Wholesale and Retail </li>
<li> <span><em>Capitalizes on Tradeweb&rsquo;s Capabilities in Money Markets and Rates, Provides Additional&nbsp;</em><em>Cross-Selling and Expansion Opportunities, Enhances Tradeweb&rsquo;s Relationships Across the Global Asset Management Sector</em></span> </li>
<li> <em>Enhances Tradeweb&rsquo;s Growth Profile by Adding An Estimated $2+ Billion Addressable Market, Adjusted Earnings Per Share Accretion Expected in First 12 Months Following Closing</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Institutional Cash Distributors, LLC (&ldquo;ICD&rdquo;), an institutional investment technology provider for corporate treasury organizations trading short-term investments, for $785 million, subject to customary adjustments. The purchase price is expected to be funded with cash on hand.</p>
<p><strong>Tradeweb Expands into New, Fast-Growing Client Channel with Addition of Corporate Treasurer Network</strong></p>
<p>With the acquisition of ICD and its powerful, proprietary technology, Tradeweb will add a new and fast-growing client channel serving corporate treasury professionals, complementing Tradeweb&rsquo;s existing focus on institutional, wholesale and retail clients. Established in 2003, ICD enables more than 500 corporate treasury organizations from growth and blue-chip companies (including approximately 17% of the S&amp;P 100 as of December 31, 2023) across 65 industries and more than 45 countries to invest in money market funds and other short-term products to manage liquidity. ICD is one of the largest U.S. institutional money market fund portals, and in 2023, had average daily balances of more than $230 billion. The company has a stable, growing and loyal client base, with 99% client retention and an exceptional net promoter score.</p>
<p>ICD&rsquo;s flagship products include ICD Portal and ICD Portfolio Analytics. The portal is a one-stop shop to research, trade, analyze, and report on investments across more than 40 available investment providers primarily offering money market funds and access to other short term products including deposits, fixed term funds and separately managed accounts (SMAs). Portfolio Analytics is an AI-driven cloud solution for aggregating positions across a corporate treasury's entire portfolio for analysis and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Compelling Opportunities for Cross-Selling and Strategic Growth</strong></p>
<p>As part of Tradeweb, ICD will provide a comprehensive solution for corporate treasurers and asset managers worldwide to manage short-term liquidity needs and FX risk, as well as optimize yield and duration via Tradeweb&rsquo;s existing suite of products. ICD clients will retain the ability to fully integrate their workflows with leading third-party treasury management and accounting systems and ICD&rsquo;s portfolio analytics solution. In addition to opportunities to cross-sell Tradeweb&rsquo;s products to ICD&rsquo;s clients, Tradeweb will aim to accelerate ICD&rsquo;s growth and expansion by leveraging Tradeweb&rsquo;s international presence and offering money market funds to Tradeweb&rsquo;s existing network of clients globally.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Strategic and Cultural Fit With Opportunity to Electronify Trading for Corporate Clients</strong></p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: &ldquo;ICD is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a leading investment platform for corporate treasurers, a fast-growing channel within fixed income markets and a strong strategic fit for Tradeweb. Acquiring ICD will further diversify our client and business mix, advancing our track record of expanding into adjacent markets to improve client workflows. As part of Tradeweb, ICD will also be positioned to drive the adoption of electronic trading for corporate treasurers. We look forward to welcoming the talented ICD team onboard, who share Tradeweb&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to delivering innovative products and extraordinary service, and to jointly creating even greater value for our clients and shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon closing of the transaction, ICD&rsquo;s CEO Tory Hazard will report to Tradeweb President Thomas Pluta and will join Tradeweb&rsquo;s Operating Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Hazard said: &ldquo;We could not have found a better partner than Tradeweb to continue providing innovative technology and exceptional service to our clients. This acquisition will enable ICD clients to have integrated access to Tradeweb&rsquo;s fixed income marketplace, while continuing to trade through our existing technology. The combined offering delivers even more of what corporate treasury wants, and together, we will be able to unlock the full potential of our technology.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Tradeweb&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share in the first 12 months following closing and meet Tradeweb&rsquo;s return on invested capital objectives. Completion of the transaction is expected in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as the lead financial advisor to Tradeweb. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC also provided advice. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP served as legal advisor. Parthenon Capital Partners was the primary investor in ICD. Raymond James and Moelis &amp; Company LLC served as its financial advisors, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP served as its legal advisor.</p>

<div> trials, Clearstream, DLT, digital Euro, platform<br />
Summary:<br />
Clearstream participates in ECB trials with DLT-enabled platform D7, aiming to assess using DLT for wholesale transaction processing and tokenised securities. <div>
<ul>
<li>Clearstream is the only central securities depository to participate in wave 1 of the trials, with all three of its CSDs (German, Luxembourg and international CSD)</li>
<li>Tests are conducted in the light of the development of a digital Euro</li>
<li>Digital post-trade platform D7 enhanced with DLT capabilities for tokenised securities</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="detailText">
<p>Clearstream, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s post-trade business, joins the European Central Bank (ECB) trials and experiments, aimed at exploring the potential of distributed-ledger technology (DLT) for wholesale central bank money settlement, in the light of the development of a digital Euro.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<br />
<p>Together with leading institutions, infrastructures and fintech businesses, Clearstream contributes to this transformative endeavour as DLT market operator with its leading digital post-trade platform D7 and all three central securities depositories (CSDs): its German CSD, LuxCSD in Luxembourg and the international CSD. Clearstream is the only CSD to participate in the first wave of the ECB trials.</p>
<p>By participating in the ECB trials, Clearstream aims to assess the feasibility of using DLT for wholesale transaction processing, using tokenised securities. This includes conducting euro-denominated issuances and delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transactions across different use-cases and payment models.</p>
<p>To optimally support the goal of the exploration, Clearstream has enhanced its digital post-trade platform D7 with respective DLT capabilities. This was done in collaboration with Google Cloud, leveraging the strategic partnership of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Google Cloud. Clearstream&rsquo;s D7 has a proven track record with over 25,000 digital securities issuances, more than any other digital post-trade solution worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="image float--left"><img alt="Jens Hachmeister" class="image float--left" src="https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/resource/blob/3880960/65729d49197041083cd1b0f45bfc2d24/data/jenshachmeister.jpg" /></div>
<br />
<p>Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets at Clearstream, said: &ldquo;Clearstream&rsquo;s participation in the ECB trials is a significant milestone in our digitisation journey: we are expanding our D7 digital securities infrastructure with DLT components and fostering connections with the main digital payment solutions across the Eurosystem. We are thrilled to further collectively shape the future of an inter-connected digital European settlement landscape together with the ECB and our broad participant base. Of course, Clearstream will leverage the trial insights to further enhance D7 for the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ECB trials will be conducted in a productive environment, using real central bank money. The timeframe is set for May to November 2024.</p>
<p>Clearstream will connect to all three central bank digital offerings: Bundesbank&rsquo;s Trigger Solution, Banca d&rsquo;Italia&rsquo;s TIPS Hash-link and Banque de France&rsquo;s Full DLT Interoperability.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
The ASEAN+3 region is forecasted to grow at 4.5% in 2024, with increasing domestic demand and potential disruptors warranting caution. Collaboration will be instrumental.
<br /><br />Summary:
The ASEAN+3 region is forecasted to grow at 4.5% in 2024, with potential disruptors warranting caution. Collaboration will be instrumental. <div>
<p>The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) today published its annual flagship report, the&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.SH2rn1fYDrsFUom0sxl58FhGbWqFSIYaLL4F7TPOgCtDRTckUCUl8aNITnyDUaziOb9PwbczpHovUSHVYu58Td1VnEmm7DPn91-2BpN6pss78-3DLyyL_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ5I6WUhxSqyEpZ9PbSQD3kgiK6f8fo-2F1NIcYeMVKFPozLt2uEGirDz5s0ytlX6UL7lioxVCGIRvvcfzX9ixbzaD2Vj-2FfO6t1nBrUh5OyywmE2aXpBqG03MZ-2FjgyJVNSMVuooLi0AgDMRb7NVvlZ0iuvdgOB31Zb4pAPPVbuMQ5Ihwc6RC0sbopITJatDdKz9aoFEX-2Bfvc8DWZpAnHeEJ2E4Ybgs9lPLDBUX1teYm6ge-2F9bon-2FEQbygBN-2B-2BqKkuGSQ3h9GgsKnchCytP7bvn9yPFtnYDygb9neia9ZBUFLt-2BDItI-2BnafyxQHmRYwW18m-2Fc" target="_blank">ASEAN+3 Regional Economic Outlook (AREO) 2024</a>. AMRO staff now forecast the ASEAN+3 region to grow at 4.5 percent this year, up from 4.3 percent in 2023. AMRO also released today its 2025 growth forecast, with the region projected to expand by 4.2 percent.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg569aleft"><img align="middle" alt="   " id="prnejpg569aleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2048913/AMRO_ColorRGB_FA_Logo.jpg" title="   " /></div>
<p>The stronger growth for ASEAN+3 this year will be mainly driven by robust domestic demand, underpinned by increasing household incomes and recovering investment activity. The anticipated turnaround in exports, in part due to the global chips upcycle, and the continued recovery of tourism will provide additional tailwinds.</p>
<p>The ASEAN region is expected to benefit from a combination of these favorable factors, with growth in 2024 and 2025 forecast at 4.8 and 4.9 percent, respectively, while growth in the Plus-3 region is expected to remain robust at 4.3 and 4.1 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>With global commodity prices continuing to stabilize, inflation in ASEAN+3&mdash;excluding Lao PDR and Myanmar&mdash;is expected to moderate from 2.8 percent last year to 2.5 percent in 2024, before easing further to 2.3 percent in 2025.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, AMRO warns against taking the region's positive momentum for granted in light of potential disruptors to the growth trajectory.</p>
<p>"A sudden spike in global commodity prices, weaker-than-expected growth in China, or escalating geopolitical tensions could turn the tide for the region," said AMRO Chief Economist Hoe Ee Khor. "Now that the current outlook is quite positive, given robust growth and gradual disinflation, ASEAN+3 economies need to rebuild policy space as much as they can."</p>
<p>It has been nearly a year since the World Health Organization declared an end to the COVID-19 pandemic and ASEAN+3 continues to grapple with pandemic scars. The global health crisis has taken a toll not only on economic activity, but also on the labor force and capital formation, especially infrastructure. Trend growth for most regional economies has remained lower than the pre-pandemic period, and the recovery in capital formation has been particularly weak.</p>
<p>"Revitalizing growth requires boosting investment and embracing technology to raise productivity and resilience, especially of smaller firms," said Khor. "Stepping up regional collaboration can be instrumental in achieving this goal."</p>
<p>AMRO also calls on ASEAN+3 economies to work more closely together in response to three key secular trends: aging, global trade reconfiguration, and rapid technological changes.</p>
<p>While these structural shifts pose various risks, they also create new sources of growth and productivity gains. Balancing the risks with the opportunities they offer will help ASEAN+3 secure sustainable, resilient, and inclusive growth in the long term.</p>
<p>"Aging presents a critical challenge for the ASEAN+3 region," said Allen Ng, AMRO Group Head and one of the lead authors of the AREO report. "At the same time, it's important to recognize that the region is not just aging. We are also living longer and healthier. Adapting to this 'longevity dividend' and enabling our populations to age productively will be crucial for the region's future."</p>
<p>Similarly, while the ongoing trade reconfiguration is casting concerns about the region's time-tested export strategies, it is also creating new opportunities. One example is the spike in FDI inflows into several ASEAN economies and strong growth in ASEAN+3's exports of "modern" services, especially those that can be delivered digitally.</p>
<p>However, concerns are rising about technology's potential impact on the future of industries and jobs in ASEAN+3, especially with the rapid progress in artificial intelligence technologies such as Generative AI.</p>
<p>"Navigating these crosscurrents requires prioritizing robust policies to secure growth under various possible futures. For ASEAN+3, this includes deepening infrastructure development as well as promoting innovation and social inclusion," Ng said.</p>

<title>Co-Head Of Cross-Asset Futures Execution At Morgan Stanley To Join Liquidnet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Morgan Stanley, Liquidnet, futures, derivatives, sales-traders
Summary:<br /> Alex Grinfeld joins Liquidnet as Executive Director, expanding global listed derivatives with experienced team, focusing on technology and automation.<br /> <div>
<p>Alex Grinfeld, an 11-year veteran and Executive Director at Morgan Stanley, has joined a noteworthy roster of senior futures sales-traders and analysts to have arrived at Liquidnet since 2022 as the technology-focused agency execution specialist, known for its dark pools, builds out its global listed derivatives offering.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Morgan Stanley, Grinfeld was a Vice President at Goldman Sachs for Futures and Derivatives Sales Trading.</p>
<p>He will co-head the rapidly growing futures business at Liquidnet in the Americas alongside Brian Cashin - hired from Bank of America - who joined Liquidnet in March 2022.</p>
<p>This comes as the firm recently launched solutions such as pre &amp; point-of-trade analytics to help inform traders&rsquo; decision-making processes and support automation. Historically, banks have dominated the provision of solutions and executions to the buy side.</p>
<p><b>Mike du Plessis, Global Head of Listed Derivatives</b>, said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Alex joins us at an exciting time in our journey, his extensive experience will be integral as we launch new technology and further develop our execution services.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>These senior hires in the US reflect similar moves in Europe, where the firm hired Dan Noorian and Darren Smith from UBS 18 months ago to lead the then-recently established Liquidnet Listed Derivatives team in London. Like their Liquidnet Americas counterparts, the duo have serious futures heritage having racked up nearly 15 years each at the Swiss bank.</p>

<title>TransFICC Launches Automated Customer Trading</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/transficc-launches-automated-customer-trading/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/transficc-launches-automated-customer-trading/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>TransFICC, the specialist provider of low-latency connectivity and workflow services for Fixed Income and Derivatives Markets, today announced the launch of TransACT, a new service which automates Request for Quote (RFQ) negotiation workflows for banks trading on Dealer-to-Client (D2C) venues. The service is in production at a global dealer.</span></p>
<p><span>D2C trading venues support multiple RFQ negotiation workflows, and all are different, making it difficult for banks to build automated negotiation systems to respond to customer RFQs. It is a complex and time-consuming process to automate these workflows, as all state transitions need to be mapped, codified, tested, and maintained.</span></p>
<p><span>TransACT (Automated Customer Trading) simplifies the process and reduces the time to market for a bank to develop automated trading solutions for customers. The bank provides the customer price and TransACT manages all other aspects of the RFQ negotiation.</span></p>
<p><span>TransFICC&rsquo;s new service is available for immediate use on MarketAxess, Tradeweb, Bloomberg and TruMid for US Credit, with the service expanding to other RFQ assets, including IRS, later this year.</span></p>
<p><span>The service automatically negotiates RFQs on dealer instruction. It is provided as a hosted service where venue connectivity and all negotiation workflows are automated. All that is required to integrate with TransACT is the ability for dealers to provide a price stream and an execute/reject instruction for a given RFQ. This is done using a simple API accessible&nbsp;via websocket.</span></p>
<p><span>TransACT&nbsp;enables dealers to fully automate significant parts of their Credit trading quickly and easily. The service allows trading desks to focus on larger tickets and&nbsp;risk management strategies, while automated RFQ negotiation provides clients with an improved and faster service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Our auto-negotiation service provides the code, support, and security out of the box. The only bank requirement is to have a Pricer, meaning the service can quickly go live. What used to take months or years for a bank to deploy has been reduced to a few weeks,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span><strong>Judd Gaddie, Co-Founder of TransFICC</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>TransFICC provides trading technology for Fixed Income, resolving the issue of market fragmentation and delivering workflow efficiencies to banks and asset managers globally. It provides connectivity to multiple trading venues while supporting a variety of workflows across asset classes such as Rates and Credit Bonds, Repos, Mortgage Backed Securities and Interest Rate Swaps.</span></p>

<title>BMLL Wins ‘Best Alliance Or Partnership’ For Snowflake Collaboration At Waters Tech Sell-Side Technology Awards</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>We are delighted to announce that BMLL has won &lsquo;</span><span>Best Alliance or Partnership&rsquo; at the Waters Tech Sell-Side Technology Awards 2024</span><span>&nbsp;for its collaboration with Snowflake.&nbsp;</span></span><span>These awards recognise market-leading technologies developed specifically for use by sell-side firms, as well as innovation and addressing the sell-side's most pressing business, regulatory, operational and technology needs.</span></p>
<p><span>In Q4 2023 BMLL partnered with Snowflake to empower market participants globally with granular data and analytics, and revolutionise the way the market interacts with Level 3 Data. At the same time, Snowflake Ventures joined existing Series B investors Nasdaq Ventures, FactSet and IQ Capital.<br /></span></p>
<p><span>In January 2024, BMLL announced the initial historical datasets available via Snowflake Marketplace: Daily Classified Trades, Level 2 Quotes and Millisecond CBBO. This completes the first phase of BMLL&rsquo;s collaboration with Snowflake and is designed to increase how customers can discover, access and evaluate datasets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The BMLL / Snowflake partnership delivers granular data and analytics to market participants worldwide. Level 3 order book data stored, curated and harmonised by BMLL, is delivered globally via Snowflake Marketplace, removing the need for costly, in-house storage and data engineering while accelerating time to insights.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The partnership will allow Snowflake&rsquo;s growing number of capital market clients to access BMLL&rsquo;s data and analytics, at speed and scale. Clients no longer need to own, store, engineer and manage these data sets, time and time again. Instead, they can concentrate on differentiating themselves by what they do with the data, not by owning it. Essentially, this partnership helps firms leapfrog infrastructure planning and implementation time, lower costs, and accelerate time to market.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, said:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to have been recognised for the&nbsp;</span><span>&lsquo;Best Alliance or Partnership&rsquo; at the WatersTech Sell-Side Technology Awards 2024. Snowflake is aligned with our mission to democratise access to the most granular order book data and analytics on a global scale by eliminating the need for resource-intensive data engineering.</span></span></p>
<p><span>As a result of the collaboration, financial institutions, including Snowflake&rsquo;s customers, do not need to dedicate time and precious resources in engineering these large unstructured data sets to make them usable. We make our vast warehouse of curated Level 3 data and analytics available to the market so that all participants can optimise their own capabilities.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Finvestor.factset.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Ffactset-and-bmll-technologies-collaborate-provide-cloud-based/1/0102018ebc809db2-f6faa35a-b779-4e0a-8243-984e0992a375-000000/6SubRlXjkJGzrY6Azv_KGnpsT2Q=368" target="_blank"><span>FactSet</span></a><span>&nbsp;was the first to access BMLL&rsquo;s data and analytics via Snowflake&rsquo;s Marketplace.</span></span></p>

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen At A Press Conference In Beijing, The People’s Republic Of China</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>PROGRESS OVER THE PAST YEAR</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to begin by speaking about the groundwork that we have laid over the past year.</p>
<p>Last April, I outlined our Administration&rsquo;s approach to our economic relationship with China. President Biden and I are clear-eyed about the complexities of this relationship. Our priorities include protecting our national security and that of our allies, advancing an objective of a healthy economic relationship with a level playing field for American workers and firms, and cooperating with China where both countries can and must.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the U.S.-China relationship is on stronger footing today than this time last year. This was not preordained. It was the direct result of President Biden&rsquo;s guidance to me and</p>
<p>his cabinet to intensify our diplomacy with China and put a floor under the relationship. Over the past year, I have met in person with my Chinese counterpart Vice Premier He Lifeng three times, including in the San Francisco Bay Area where I call home. We established Economic and Financial Working Groups that have seen substantive, in-depth economic conversations. These build on the candid and constructive meeting between President Biden and President Xi in Woodside, California last November.</p>
<p>Through these exchanges, my team and I have been able to advance the interests of the American people. We have set forth our own economic policy priorities and gained an improved understanding of China&rsquo;s. We have advocated for specific steps to ensure American workers and firms are treated fairly. We have directly communicated American national security concerns, and both countries have clarified potential misunderstandings to prevent unintentional escalation. And we have restarted cooperation on issues where our interests coincide. Last November, the Vice Premier and I took the important step of affirming key areas of agreement, including a commitment to work toward a healthy economic relationship that provides a level playing field for both countries.</p>
<p>This progress matters. Given the size of our economies, the U.S.-China economic relationship is among the most important bilateral economic relationships in the world. And it matters deeply for American workers and firms. In turn, the American people expect their leaders to do the hard work of economic diplomacy. That&rsquo;s not the type that always generates headlines. It&rsquo;s one that keeps at it despite the noise&mdash;in order to advance a responsible approach to the complex challenges that we face.</p>
<p>President Biden and I are committed to such an approach. And it is what brought me here to China.</p>
<h3>KEY STEPS FORWARD DURING TRIP TO CHINA</h3>
<p>Over the past week, I have had the opportunity to make progress on issues that matter to</p>
<p>Americans. I&rsquo;ve had productive, direct, and extensive meetings over four days in Guangzhou and Beijing with China&rsquo;s economic leadership, including Premier Li, Vice Premier He, Governor Pan, and Finance Minister Lan. I have also met with those outside of the central government, including American and other foreign businesses, Chinese academics and students, and local government leaders with practical, on-the-ground economic policy responsibilities.</p>
<p>Let me outline three areas where we&rsquo;ve made significant progress this week.</p>
<h4>Exchanges on Balanced Growth in the Domestic and Global Economies</h4>
<p>First, Vice Premier He and I agreed to launch intensive exchanges on balanced growth in the domestic and global economies. This represents an important part of my effort to advocate for American workers and businesses and gain a better understanding of certain PRC macroeconomic policies. Let me explain.</p>
<p>During conversations this week, I underscored again that the United States does not seek to decouple from China. Our two economies are deeply integrated, and a wholesale separation would be disastrous for both of our economies. Even as we take actions to diversify our supply chains, we seek to preserve the broader trade and investment relationship that can benefit American workers and firms. China is a key market for American products and services. And competition between our firms can spur greater dynamism and innovation in American industries. The American businesses that I spoke to in Guangzhou underscored the significant benefits of a healthy economic relationship.</p>
<p>At the same time, I expressed concern to senior Chinese officials that there are features of the Chinese economy that have growing negative spillovers on the U.S. and the globe. I am particularly worried about how China&rsquo;s enduring macroeconomic imbalances&mdash;namely its weak household consumption and business overinvestment, aggravated by large-scale government support in specific industrial sectors&mdash;will lead to significant risk to workers and businesses in the United States and the rest of the world. China has long had excess savings, but investment in the real estate sector and government-funded infrastructure had absorbed much of it. Now, we are seeing an increase in business investment in a number of &ldquo;new&rdquo; industries targeted by the PRC&rsquo;s industrial policy. That includes electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar.</p>
<p>China is now simply too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity. Actions taken by the PRC today can shift world prices. And when the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products, the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this story before. Over a decade ago, massive PRC government support led to below-cost Chinese steel that flooded the global market and decimated industries across the world and in the United States. I&rsquo;ve made clear that President Biden and I will not accept that reality again. I know that these serious concerns are shared by our allies and partners, from advanced economies to emerging markets.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s excess capacity has built up over a significant amount of time, and our concerns will not be resolved in a week or a month. But the exchanges that we announced during this trip will provide a dedicated structure for us to raise our concerns about China&rsquo;s imbalances and overcapacity&mdash;among a wide range of other topics&mdash;in a detailed and targeted manner. We intend to underscore the need for a shift in policy by China during these talks&mdash;building on the over two hours I spent on this topic with the Vice Premier last week. This is a part of our effort to advocate for American industries and prevent the significant economic disruptions we&rsquo;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that I firmly believe that addressing these imbalances in an appropriate way will not only be good for the U.S. and the world. It will also be good for China&rsquo;s long-term productivity and growth. Importantly, we have and will continue to emphasize that our concern about overcapacity is not animated by anti-China sentiment or a desire to decouple. Rather, it is driven by a desire to prevent global economic dislocation and move toward a healthy economic relationship with China.</p>
<h4>Anti-Money Laundering Cooperation</h4>
<p>Second, I was pleased to announce that we are expanding cooperation with China in our shared work against illicit finance. At home, President Biden and I have taken major steps to prevent illicit actors from exploiting the U.S. financial system and to hold them accountable when they do. But the United States cannot do it alone. Weaknesses in financial regulatory regimes abroad&mdash;in China and other countries around the world&mdash;also provide an avenue for financing for criminal organizations, human traffickers, drug traffickers, fraudsters, and other malicious actors that can harm Americans and our national security. From now on, a new Joint Treasury- PBOC Cooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering, established during this trip, will enable our countries to share best practices and information to clamp down on loopholes in our respective financial systems. I&rsquo;ve asked my team to begin these meetings very soon, and we look forward to reporting on our progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also pleased that illicit finance is a critical component of Treasury&rsquo;s work with the PBOC as part of the U.S.-PRC Counternarcotics Working Group. Exchanging information on money laundering as it relates to trafficking of fentanyl and other illicit synthetic drugs can help us disrupt the flow of illicit narcotics, precursor chemicals, and equipment. The opioid epidemic is a crisis that affects every community in the United States, large or small, with more than 150 Americans dying each day. Treasury is committed to using all of our tools, including international cooperation, to counter this threat.</p>
<h4>Financial Technical Exchanges and Broader Cooperation with China</h4>
<p>Third, we are announcing that we will continue a series of financial technical exchanges between the United States and China. Just like military leaders need a hotline in a crisis, American and Chinese financial regulators must be able to communicate to prevent financial stresses from turning into crises with tremendous ramifications for our citizens and the international community. Over the past few months, we have hosted several exercises with China, including on how we would coordinate if there were to be a failure of a large bank in either of our countries. I&rsquo;m pleased that we will hold upcoming exchanges on operational resilience in the financial sector and on financial stability implications from the insurance sector&rsquo;s exposure to climate risks.</p>
<p>These are the types of discussions that we have with other major economies, since we know a financial issue in a foreign country can quickly cascade to ours. I am glad that we are doing the same with China.</p>
<p>This technical exchange builds on other spheres of cooperation. This includes our efforts to alleviate debt distress in emerging markets and developing countries. We have seen progress over the past few months on specific debt cases, such as Zambia&rsquo;s. I have and will continue to push as hard as I can to build greater momentum in other outstanding debt cases. I have also been pleased by the progress we have made in conversations around sustainable finance and am committed to moving our climate cooperation with China forward.</p>
<h4>Macroeconomy and National Security</h4>
<p>Alongside these specific steps, I also exchanged views with Chinese officials on the macroeconomy and national security. I shared my assessment that the American economy remains strong, with President Biden&rsquo;s historic economic agenda driving both our current resilience and long-term growth. We also discussed risks to the resilient global outlook. I was able to learn more about how the Chinese government views their current economic and financial situation and the steps that they have and are contemplating taking. These exchanges help inform our government&rsquo;s own economic decision-making.</p>
<p>We also had difficult conversations about national security. President Biden and I are determined to do all that we can to stem the flow of material that is supporting Russia&rsquo;s defense industrial base and helping it to wage war against Ukraine. We continue to be concerned about the role that any firms, including those in the PRC, are playing in Russia&rsquo;s military procurement. I stressed that companies, including those in the PRC, must not provide material support for Russia&rsquo;s war and that they will face significant consequences if they do. And I reinforced that any banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to Russia&rsquo;s defense industrial base expose themselves to the risk of U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>We also exchanged information on the use of economic tools in the national security space. Going forward, I believe that we must continue to discuss how each side defines national security in the economic sphere. While the U.S. needs to continually evaluate its national security measures given the rapid pace of technological development, we are committed to &ldquo;no surprises.&rdquo; We have privately and publicly laid out our perspective at length, along with the principles and process that we undertake in formulating our policies. Our actions are implemented through transparent rules and regulations with ample comment periods. We would welcome transparency from the PRC on its national security actions and greater clarity on where it sees the line between national security and economic issues. This would provide greater stability to the relationship while also helping bolster confidence for firms doing business with the PRC, which is in China&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>Vice Premier He and I committed to stay in close touch about these issues. The United States will also be hosting our Chinese counterparts next week for the fourth meetings of the Economic and Financial Working Groups, where these issues will be discussed at length.</p>
<h3>CLOSING</h3>
<p>Let me end with this. The work of diplomacy is not easy. But in the few months since the Woodside Summit&mdash;and certainly since I visited Beijing last summer&mdash;we have taken major steps to stabilize the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. And during this trip, we have been able to build on that foundation to move the ball forward on specific issues that matter to Americans.</p>
<p>That does not mean we have resolved all our differences. There is much more work to do. And it remains unclear what this relationship will endure in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>But as we proceed, we must remember that its trajectory is not predestined. It depends on the choices that each of our countries make. I know that the American people expect a clear-eyed approach to China: one that proceeds with confidence about the economic strength of our country and protects our national security while finding a way forward so that both countries can live in a world of peace and prosperity. The President and I are firmly committed to continue to deliver on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take your questions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: FMA, financial markets, business continuity, technology systems, notification process

Summary: The FMA introduces a new standard condition for certain market licence holders focusing on business continuity and technology systems. A notification process for reporting incidents is also launched. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is introducing a new standard condition for certain market licence holders following consultation. The new licence condition will focus on business continuity and technology systems. The new condition will come into effect on 1 July 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">The standard condition is relevant to the following types of market service licences:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">Managers of registered schemes (but not restricted schemes) &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">Providers of discretionary investment management services &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">Derivatives issuers &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">Prescribed intermediary services (peer-to-peer lending providers and crowdfunding service providers).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">The new standard condition requires licence holders to have and maintain a business continuity plan that is appropriate for the scale and scope of its service. Licence holders will also be required to make sure that their critical technology systems are operationally resilient. If the licence holder suffers an event that materially affects the supply of its service, it must notify the FMA as soon as possible, or no later than 72 hours after it has determined the event is a material incident.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">New notification process for reporting incidents relating to the cyber and operational resilience of technology systems&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">Most market services licence holders are required to notify the FMA of any event that materially impacts the operational resilience of their critical technology systems. This includes an event that materially disrupts or affects the provision of the licensee&rsquo;s market service or has a materially adverse impact on recipients of those services. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">The FMA has launched a secure online notification form for licence holders to notify the FMA of material incidents. This will aid reporting by including key information that will be requested at the time of reporting and provide instructions on what is expected of licence holders. The form is intended to be light-touch and, for Reserve Bank regulated entities, be compatible with the Reserve Bank cyber incident notification process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">FMA Director of Specialist Supervision and Response, Peter Taylor, said: &ldquo;The FMA continues to build its regulatory framework for promoting cyber and operational resilience in the financial markets. The feedback from our consultation on the new standard condition shows that the market is also supportive of our plan. We have used the feedback to refine our approach and help reduce regulatory burden.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW237926048 BCX8">&ldquo;The online notification form for reporting of cyber and operational incidents is intended to aid reporting by entities and provide the FMA early notification due to the often time-sensitive nature of these incidents. We have also ensured that Reserve Bank regulated entities are not further burdened by ensuring this process remains compatible with the Reserve Bank requirements.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> investment, Ethiopian Securities Exchange, NGX Group, partnership, economic development
Summary:<br />
NGX Group invests in Ethiopian Securities Exchange. Partnership underscores commitment to African capital market growth. Group Managing Director joins ESX board. ESX exceeds capital raise target. Private sector holds 75% of exchange. 
<br /> <div>
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), a leading integrated market infrastructure group in Africa, has announced a significant investment in the Ethiopian Securities Exchange (ESX).</p>
<p>NGX Group is among the top institutional investors that have injected capital into the operationalisation of the bourse alongside FSD Africa, a UK-backed non-profit financial institution, and Trade and Development Bank Group (TDB), the financial arm of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) trade block.</p>
<p>This pivotal move not only marks NGX Group&rsquo;s entry into East Africa but also underscores its commitment to driving growth and innovation in the African capital markets, while strategically positioning itself as the largest foreign institutional investor in the ESX.</p>
<p>The investment in the Ethiopian Stock Exchange reflects NGX Group's confidence in the potential of Ethiopia's rapidly growing economy and capital market. By partnering with ESX, NGX Group aims to support the development of a vibrant and resilient financial ecosystem in Ethiopia, fostering increased investor participation and capital formation.</p>
<p>Through this investment, NGX Group aims to contribute to robust regulatory frameworks and foster best practices within the ESX ecosystem. The Group remains dedicated to providing ongoing technical assistance and capability enhancements to support the successful operations and growth of the ESX.</p>
<p>Alhaji Umaru Kwairanga, Chairman of NGX Group, stated, " We extend our congratulations to the ESX on its successful capital raise and commend the Government of Ethiopia and the private sector for their support in bringing this pioneering initiative in the country to fruition. Our partnership with ESX is a resounding affirmation of our unwavering dedication to promoting economic development, transparency, and exemplary corporate governance standards that foster an environment conducive to inclusive growth, even as we aim to maximize value for our esteemed shareholders."</p>
<p>Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director/CEO of NGX Group, commented: "We are excited to announce our investment in the Ethiopian Stock Exchange, which represents a significant milestone in our expansion strategy. Ethiopia is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, with immense potential for investment and growth. We believe that by partnering with the Ethiopian Stock Exchange, we can leverage our expertise and experience to contribute to the development of a robust and dynamic capital market in Ethiopia&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tilahun Esmael Kassahun, CEO of the ESX stated, "We are thrilled to announce that the capital raise for Ethiopia's first securities exchange has exceeded our expectations, reflecting the unwavering confidence of investors in the potential and prospects of Ethiopia's economic landscape. We are pleased to welcome the NGX Group as a strategic partner, building upon the existing support we have received from the NGX Group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this investment, Mr. Temi Popoola will join the board of ESX as a nominee of NGX Group. The investment demonstrates NGX Group&rsquo;s commitment to driving regional integration and collaboration within the African capital markets.

<title>Statement From US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen On Announcement Of New U.S.-China Initiatives Following Meeting With Vice Premier He Lifeng Of The People’s Republic Of China</title>

<div> initiatives, balanced growth, domestic and global economies, anti-money laundering, financial stability<br />
Summary:<br />
The US and China agreed to launch initiatives on balanced growth, anti-money laundering, and financial stability to protect American interests. <div>
<p>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen today released the following statement&nbsp;on the announcement of new initiatives following her meeting with Vice Premier He&nbsp;Lifeng&nbsp;of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just concluded&nbsp;an extensive and&nbsp;productive two days of meetings in Guangzhou with Vice Premier He&nbsp;Lifeng&nbsp;of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.&nbsp;After significant discussion with my counterpart, I am pleased that we have agreed to launch two significant new initiatives that will&nbsp;advance the interests of American workers and firms and&nbsp;help&nbsp;protect&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;national security.</p>
<p>First, we agreed that the U.S. and China will&nbsp;hold&nbsp;intensive&nbsp;exchanges on&nbsp;balanced growth in the domestic and global economies.&nbsp;These exchanges&nbsp;will facilitate a discussion around macroeconomic imbalances, including their connection to overcapacity,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I intend to use this opportunity to&nbsp;advocate for a level playing field for American workers and firms. I am particularly concerned about the impact of Chinese industrial overcapacity in certain sectors&nbsp;as a result of government&nbsp;support, and the impact it could have on the American economy.&nbsp;Last week, I visited&nbsp;Suniva&mdash;a solar company in Georgia&nbsp;that was once forced to&nbsp;close down, like other companies across a number of industries, because it&nbsp;could not&nbsp;compete&nbsp;against large quantities of goods that China was exporting at artificially depressed prices. It&rsquo;s important that this doesn&rsquo;t happen again. These concerns&nbsp;are shared by our allies and partners, who see potential risks to their own&nbsp;domestic&nbsp;workers and firms.&nbsp;I&nbsp;firmly believe a shift away from policies that drive&nbsp;overcapacity would benefit the American, Chinese, and global economies.</p>
<p>These exchanges on balanced growth in the domestic and global economies are&nbsp;key to allowing us to deepen our understanding of China&rsquo;s policies and&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;express our concerns, as I have done in my meetings with Vice&nbsp;Premier&nbsp;He. These discussions are critical to&nbsp;protecting&nbsp;American interests and&nbsp;to&nbsp;making&nbsp;further progress toward the healthy economic relationship the Vice Premier and I jointly seek.</p>
<p>Second, we agreed that the U.S. and China will&nbsp;start&nbsp;Joint Treasury-PBOC Cooperation&nbsp;and Exchange&nbsp;on Anti-Money Laundering to expand cooperation&nbsp;against&nbsp;illicit finance&nbsp;and financial crime. Around the world, fraudsters, drug traffickers, and other criminal organizations and individuals identify and exploit loopholes in the U.S. and Chinese financial systems to advance their illicit activities. This causes harm to Americans and to our country&rsquo;s national security, as well as to people and economies around the world. This new&nbsp;effort&nbsp;will enable the U.S. and China to share best practices and&nbsp;provide&nbsp;updates&nbsp;on the actions we are each taking to close loopholes&nbsp;in our&nbsp;respective financial systems. Since it is secrecy that enables criminals to flourish, our collaborative effort is a key step forward to advancing the security of Americans and protecting the integrity of two of the largest financial systems in the world.</p>
<p>In addition, I welcome the announcement that the U.S. and China will continue holding technical exchanges on financial issues, including upcoming ones on operational resilience in the financial services sector&nbsp;and&nbsp;on financial stability implications from the&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;sector.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussions on these and other topics with&nbsp;other&nbsp;senior&nbsp;government officials throughout my trip to China and to future engagements with the Vice Premier in the coming months to advance&nbsp;American economic priorities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met on April 5-6 with Vice Premier He&nbsp;Lifeng&nbsp;of the&nbsp;People&rsquo;s Republic of China in Guangzhou, China. &nbsp;Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He had frank and productive discussions on the U.S.-China bilateral&nbsp;economic&nbsp;relationship and a wide range of issues. Secretary Yellen noted areas of cooperation and directly raised issues of concern.</p>
<p>Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He opened discussions with an exchange of views on domestic and global macroeconomic and financial developments. Secretary Yellen explained that the U.S. economy remains resilient&nbsp;and has been a key driver of global growth.&nbsp;She acknowledged significant headwinds and risks to the global economy, including the&nbsp;need for&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;to end its&nbsp;illegal war against Ukraine. The two sides also discussed the outlook for the Chinese economy and financial developments.</p>
<p>Secretary Yellen reaffirmed with Vice Premier He the important foundations of the U.S.-China economic relationship&nbsp;that the two sides agreed to in November, including the need to intensify communication, the shared objective of a healthy economic relationship&nbsp;that provides&nbsp;a level playing field, and a commitment to work together on shared challenges, including climate&nbsp;finance&nbsp;and debt issues in low-income and emerging economies.</p>
<p>After extended&nbsp;and&nbsp;substantive discussions, Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He announced two&nbsp;significant new initiatives that the&nbsp;U.S. and China&nbsp;will launch&nbsp;on economic issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange on&nbsp;Balanced Growth in the Domestic and Global Economies: Co-led by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and China&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance under the framework of the Economic Working Group, the United States and China have agreed to hold intensive exchanges on balanced growth in the domestic and global economies. In these discussions, the two sides will discuss more balanced economic growth and its importance to the world economy, including issues like domestic demand, investment policies, aging populations, fiscal issues, and related policies.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Joint Treasury-PBOC Cooperation&nbsp;and Exchange&nbsp;on Anti-Money Laundering: The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the People&rsquo;s Bank of China have agreed to start an exchange under the framework of the Financial Working Group to cooperate on our shared priority of combatting money laundering in our respective financial systems. This exchange will enable economic officials and experts from the U.S. and China to regularly share best practices and updates about our efforts to combat illicit finance, including efforts to close gaps in the U.S. and Chinese financial regulatory systems. This effort will help close off financing avenues for criminal organizations, including drug traffickers, human traffickers, and fraudsters. The first such exchange will be held in the coming weeks during the fourth Financial Working Group meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. and China agreed to continue holding technical exchanges on financial issues, including upcoming ones on operational resilience in the financial services sector and on financial stability implications from the insurance sector. Secretary Yellen also expressed appreciation for the progress made on conversations around sustainable finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secretary Yellen also raised concerns regarding the breadth and&nbsp;scale&nbsp;of China&rsquo;s non-market policies and practices&nbsp;and their impact on U.S. workers and firms. She noted&nbsp;signs of increasing overcapacity in certain sectors of the Chinese economy&nbsp;and&nbsp;urged action to address&nbsp;the concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He also discussed recent national security actions. Secretary Yellen&nbsp;emphasized that companies, including those in the PRC,&nbsp;must not provide material support for Russia&rsquo;s&nbsp;war against Ukraine, including support to the Russian&nbsp;defense industrial base, and the significant consequences if they do so.&nbsp;She&nbsp;underscored that U.S. national security actions in the economic sphere are predicated on clearly defined national security concerns, narrowly scoped, and transparently&nbsp;implemented.&nbsp;She also underscored that the United States is not seeking to decouple from China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meetings build on progress made by President Biden and President Xi at the Woodside Summit last November&nbsp;and Secretary Yellen&rsquo;s previous meetings with Vice Premier He. &nbsp;Both sides agreed to keep in close contact and to continue progress through the Economic Working Group and Financial Working Group, which have met three times since their establishment last fall.</p>

<div> insider trading, federal securities laws, Matthew Panuwat, trial, jury<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Matthew Panuwat found liable for insider trading. Used confidential information to trade ahead of acquisition announcement for personal enrichment. SEC filed civil complaint. <div>
<p class="xxxx">Today, after an eight day trial and only several hours of deliberation, a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California found Matthew Panuwat liable for insider trading in violation of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>Statement of SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve said all along, there was nothing novel about this matter, and the jury agreed: this was insider trading, pure and simple.&nbsp;Defendant used highly confidential information about an impending announcement of the acquisition of biopharmaceutical company Medivation, Inc., the company where he worked, by Pfizer Inc. to trade ahead of the news for his own enrichment. Rather than buying the securities of Medivation, however, Panuwat used his employer&rsquo;s confidential information to acquire a large stake in call options of another comparable public company, Incyte Corporation, whose share price increased materially on the important news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ###</p>

<div> fraud, crypto asset securities, Terraform Labs, Do Kwon, SEC
Summary:<br />SEC found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for defrauding investors in crypto asset securities, deceiving about stability, causing massive losses. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="xxxxx">Today, after a nine-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. and Do Kwon liable for defrauding investors in crypto asset securities. Previously, the Court found that Terraform Labs and Kwon unlawfully offered and sold crypto asset securities in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.</p>
<p>Statement of SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir S. Grewal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with today&rsquo;s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud. Terraform Labs and Kwon, its former CEO, deceived investors about the stability of the crypto asset security and so-called algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD, and they further misled investors about whether a popular payment application used Terraform&rsquo;s blockchain to process and settle payments. Through these deceptions, the defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto&rsquo;s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="xxxx">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ###</p>
<p>More information:</p>
<p>On February 26, 2023, the SEC filed its civil complaint:</p>

<p>&nbsp;On June 8, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a district court order requiring compliance with SEC investigative subpoenas served on Terraform and Kwon:</p>

<div> Meeting, Recommendations, Market Risk, Financial Markets, Derivatives<br />
Summary:<br />
CFTC Commissioner announces agenda for MRAC public meeting addressing market resilience, financial market stability, and AI integration. Participants can access via phone or submit public comments. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson, sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC), today announced the agenda for the MRAC public meeting on Tuesday, April 9, from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (EDT), at the CFTC&rsquo;s Washington, D.C., headquarters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At the meeting, the MRAC will consider recommendations, developed by a diverse, multi-stakeholder working group, intended to strengthen the resilience of the markets the CFTC oversees and introduce effective solutions that enhance the recovery or orderly wind down of&nbsp;<span>central counterparties. These recommendations complement a proposed rule under consideration by the Commission and reinforce critical reforms adopted in the wake of the recent financial crisis.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;These reforms improve the integrity and stability of domestic and global derivatives markets,&rdquo; said Commissioner Johnson.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In addition,&nbsp;<span>Commissioner Johnson&nbsp;</span>noted,<span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span>T<span>he MRAC will receive an unprecedented formal report on the state of the intermediated clearing markets offering an analysis&nbsp;</span>from&nbsp;<span>the Market Structure Subcommittee</span>&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp;FCM Concentration and Capacity Workstream. This report details&nbsp;</span>two decades of decline in the aggregate<span>&nbsp;number of FCMs during a parallel period of remarkable growth in the total volume of customer holdings supported by the diminishing number of FCMs available to support the increased volume. A second Market Structure Subcommittee will present on the U</span>nited&nbsp;<span>S</span>tates<span>&nbsp;treasury cash-futures basis trade and risk-management considerations.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;The&nbsp;</span><span>Future of Finance Subcommittee&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Risk Management in Financial Markets Workstream will introduce a work plan that outlines forthcoming suggestions for the Commission and a broader coalition of financial market regulators to begin to understand the scope and risk management impact of integrating AI in markets</span>&nbsp;the CFTC oversees<span>,&rdquo; said Commissioner Johnson.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>According to Commissioner Johnson, &ldquo;Consistent with the MRAC&rsquo;s mission, the diverse stakeholders on the subcommittees have considered various issues that raise systemic risk concerns and are making recommendations and advancing an agenda that examines how best to mitigate and minimize these risks, offering pragmatic solutions that support the resilience of derivatives markets and the integrity and stability of derivatives markets.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for the invitation to speak to the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The SOMC has a distinguished reputation for fostering substantive analysis and debate regarding independent, transparent, and systematic approaches to central bank policymaking. It's a pleasure to join you today and to discuss some of the current issues facing central banks and monetary policymakers.</p>
<p>In my remarks today, I will review some of the notable developments in the U.S. economy and financial system&mdash;as well as review key monetary policy actions and communications&mdash;since I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and became a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in late November 2018. As I look back over these five-plus years, I will consider how a range of uncertainties and risks regarding the macroeconomy and its measurement have affected monetary policy decisions and communications. I will also highlight some considerations regarding financial stability risks and monetary policy. I will conclude with my own views on the near-term economic outlook, some of the prominent risks and uncertainties surrounding my outlook, and my views on the implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Monetary Policy amid a Wide Range of Uncertainties and Risks</strong><br />An omni-present challenge monetary policymakers face is how to account for uncertainties surrounding the current state of the economy and the economic outlook when setting monetary policy. Macroeconomic models that can help guide the setting of monetary policy often invoke unobservable concepts such as the natural rate of unemployment, potential output, or the neutral real interest rate. These unobservable concepts can be estimated but only with a considerable degree of uncertainty, and the estimates may vary over time&mdash;for example, because of structural changes in the economy. Macroeconomic models are also subject to uncertainty, since they must make simplifying assumptions regarding the complex set of relationships and interactions among households, businesses, governments, and the financial system that also evolve and change. Moreover, the data that are used to estimate model parameters and to formulate the economic outlook are inherently uncertain and are often revised as the statistical agencies refine their estimates or gather more information.</p>
<p>In addition to uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic models and measurement, there are a number of risks that, if realized, could shock the economy and financial system, making it more difficult for policymakers to confidently assess the economy and the economic outlook. Despite these challenges, monetary policymaking requires a forward-looking approach, since its actions affect the economy, labor markets, and inflation with a lag.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p><em>The post&ndash;financial crisis economy and monetary policy at the zero lower bound</em><br />When I joined the FOMC in late 2018, despite nearly a decade of accommodative monetary policy following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, one of the primary concerns was that inflation had persistently been running slightly below the Committee's 2 percent inflation target. There was a recognition that the "natural rate of unemployment" may have been lower than many on the FOMC had estimated, and that inflation may have become less responsive to reductions in the unemployment rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This recognition meant that preemptive increases in the federal funds rate based on expected reductions in the unemployment rate alone may not have been needed to keep inflation and inflation expectations aligned with the Committee's 2 percent target.</p>
<p>A central topic of FOMC meeting discussions throughout 2019 was how monetary policy strategies and tools could best achieve the Committee's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment when structurally low interest rates and disinflationary forces kept inflation persistently under the Committee's inflation target. There was also a concern that the federal funds rate, the FOMC's key policy rate, was too close to the "zero lower bound." And that this proximity could limit the Committee's ability to respond effectively to an adverse shock by using our primary monetary policy tool of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate. More broadly, many central banks around the world were grappling with the prospect of structurally lower interest rates due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes and higher savings rates, lower potential output and productivity growth, and greater investor demand for safe assets like Treasury securities.</p>
<p>At the time, the FOMC assessed that downward risks to both employment and inflation were likely to remain prominent due to the proximity of interest rates to the zero lower bound. In August 2020, the FOMC significantly revised its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy to reflect this assessment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;A notable change relative to the initial statement adopted in 2012 was a change in the language addressing how the FOMC would conduct monetary policy. The new statement noted that the Committee would seek "to mitigate&nbsp;<em>shortfalls&nbsp;</em>[emphasis added]"&mdash;rather than "deviations"&mdash;"of employment from the Committee's assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;By replacing the word "deviations" with "shortfalls" when describing employment and the Committee's reaction to changes in employment relative to estimates of its maximum level, the Committee indicated that it would not act preemptively to curb inflation based only on the perception of labor market tightness.</p>
<p>Another notable change to the strategy statement was the adoption of what some refer to as "asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting" or "temporary price level targeting."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Specifically, the new statement noted that "in order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at [its 2 percent goal], the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>The revisions to the FOMC's statement focused on monetary policy in a world of structurally low interest rates, disinflationary forces, and an apparent insensitivity of inflation to low levels of unemployment. Although the revised statement reaffirmed the commitment to the Committee's inflation target, it did not describe how the Committee would respond if inflation were to run persistently&nbsp;<em>above</em>&nbsp;its 2 percent goal.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Given the timing of its implementation, the revised strategy guided how the FOMC responded to one of the largest shocks experienced by the U.S. economy in recent years&mdash;the COVID-19 pandemic. This shock&mdash;combined with the policy responses of governments and central banks around the world&mdash;disrupted many of the dynamics that had influenced the economy over the previous several decades and the post&ndash;2008 financial crisis approach to monetary policy. These impacts will affect how we think about monetary policy going forward, but let's first put the COVID-19 event and response into better context.</p>
<p><em>The COVID-19 shock and monetary policy response</em><br />Toward the latter part of the FOMC's monetary policy framework review, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to the global economy and financial system. Widespread economic lockdowns and social distancing, combined with other pandemic effects, caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression. Many critical parts of the U.S. financial system experienced significant disruption or completely ceased to function. The Federal Reserve responded forcefully to mitigate the financial market turmoil and the economic effects of the rapid shutdown of the U.S. economy (and I'll have more to say on this topic later).</p>
<p>As a part of its response, the FOMC quickly lowered the target range for the federal funds rate back to 0 to 1/4 percent and began purchasing large amounts of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases were initially designed to support the smooth functioning of securities markets and the flow of credit to businesses and households. Later, the purchases provided additional monetary policy accommodation to support economic activity and labor markets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>Following the return to the zero lower bound, in addition to conducting asset purchases, the FOMC used forward guidance to provide additional monetary policy accommodation to keep both short- and longer-term interest rates low. In its March 15, 2020, statement, the FOMC noted that it expected to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent "until it [was] confident that the economy [had] weathered recent events and [was] on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Following the release of the revised framework in August 2020, the FOMC revised the forward guidance in its September post-meeting statement to be more explicitly outcome-based to state that the target range would remain at 0 to 1/4 percent "until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;In its December 2020 post-meeting statement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding its asset purchases by noting that it expected that the current pace of asset purchases would continue until "substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>This explicit outcome-based forward guidance, like the revised monetary policy framework, was very focused on supporting the economy following the COVID-19 shock amid the risks of persistently low inflation and disinflationary forces with structurally low interest rates. The guidance was also quite restrictive in the criteria for slowing the pace of asset purchases, especially since the FOMC would stop asset purchases before it would raise the federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>One could argue the December forward guidance made it much more difficult for the FOMC to react to new information suggesting that risks and uncertainties had evolved in response to pandemic-related changes in the economy. Other uncertainties such as the accuracy of real-time economic measurements also presented challenges, as did significant supply-side disruptions and the uncertainty about the timing of progress toward their resolution, which I will discuss next.</p>
<p><em>The post-pandemic economy, the resurgence of inflation, and the rapid tightening in monetary policy</em><br />In the early phases of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world implemented support programs for labor markets and households and businesses.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;These generous policies, combined with very accommodative monetary policies, bolstered private-sector and state and local government balance sheets. In particular, they led to what has come to be known as "excess savings"&mdash;above-normal household savings from extraordinary levels of fiscal support and a limited ability to freely spend it due to economic lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, and other pandemic- and recession-related factors.</p>
<p>In 2021, novel medical treatments, reduced social distancing, and innovative business approaches in adapting to the restrictive pandemic environment led to a sharp economic rebound. Strong demand (supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies), a reduced labor supply (due in part to early retirements, childcare responsibilities, and concerns about COVID-19), and a mismatch between available jobs and workers all contributed to a very tight labor market. The unusually rapid rebound in economic activity, pandemic-driven shift to consumer goods spending, supply chain fragilities, and manufacturing component shortages led to crippling bottlenecks for a number of industries. These supply and demand imbalances, likely amplified by fiscal and monetary policies, led to a sharp rise in inflation over a period of just a few months.</p>
<p>By the second half of 2021, inflationary pressures intensified and became more broad- based. Labor markets were extremely tight, though it was difficult to assess the true extent of tightness, given the decrease in labor force participation and mixed data signals at the time, which all were later revised. Of the many difficult issues the Committee faced, one of the most important was whether inflation would persist or would resolve as supply-side issues eventually eased.</p>
<p>The September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showed the median FOMC expectation for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation of 4.2 percent at the end of 2021, largely reflecting high inflation readings in the first half of 2021. But for year-end 2022, the median expectation was for PCE inflation to decline to 2.2 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Private-sector forecasters expected higher inflation of 5.1 percent at year-end 2021 but also projected a slowing to just over 2 percent by the end of 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;With the benefit of hindsight, we now know that most forecasters, ourselves included, vastly misjudged the persistence of inflation at that time, with 5.9 percent PCE inflation for both 2021 and 2022. This example underscores the challenge we faced in identifying which factors were driving inflation and how long those forces would persist.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2021, it became clear that the FOMC's monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy stance. It seems likely to me that the experience of the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change. Of course, the inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Together, these factors, combined with the FOMC's forward guidance discussed earlier, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.</p>
<p>The shift in the Committee's forward guidance toward the end of 2021 and in early 2022 was effective in moving longer-dated interest rates higher and in tightening financial conditions, even before the FOMC raised the federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;At our November 2021 meeting, we announced that we would begin to slow the pace of purchases later that month. At the December 2021 meeting, we doubled the pace of tapering, which accelerated the end of purchases to the following March. At the March 2022 FOMC meeting, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. And in May, the FOMC announced its plan to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings&mdash;which then stood at around $8.5 trillion&mdash;starting in June and at a pace much faster than in the previous episode of balance sheet reduction.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;The FOMC also continued to increase the target range for the federal funds rate over the course of 2022 at a pace much faster than in previous tightening cycles, as it became clear that inflation was higher and more persistent than many forecasters had expected. By July 2023, the FOMC had increased the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 percentage points, and into restrictive territory, where it has remained. And we have continued to reduce the size of our securities holdings.</p>
<p>The monetary policy experience during the pandemic highlights how difficult it can be to assess the current state of the economy and to predict how it will evolve in the presence of major supply- and demand-side shocks, possible structural changes in the economy, and real-time data and measurement uncertainty. An important question I will be thinking about going forward is how to make monetary policy decisions and communications more robust to these types of risks.</p>
<p><em>Separate tools for monetary policy and financial stability</em><br />We know that monetary policy transmission is most effective during periods of stable financial conditions, and that financial stability risks, if realized, can affect the economic outlook. While monetary policy and financial stability are connected, financial stability vulnerabilities and risks are most appropriately addressed using macro- and micro-prudential regulation and bank supervision. During periods of extreme financial stress, well-calibrated lending and liquidity programs can be used to address such conditions. Of course, where risks impact the outlook for economic activity, employment, and inflation, a monetary policy response may also be required.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's use of liquidity and lending programs during the early stages of the pandemic demonstrated the effectiveness of emergency lending tools as backstops to support market functioning and the flow of credit in times of stress.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Lending programs are most effective as backstops when loans are offered at a penalty rate and are of short duration. When appropriately calibrated, they can help promote market functioning and the effective transmission of monetary policy but limit the Federal Reserve's overall footprint in financial markets in the longer term. This experience also highlights the importance of clearly distinguishing monetary policy actions from temporary central bank asset purchase programs used to promote core financial market functioning, like those created to support Treasury markets in the spring of 2020.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>More recently, the bank failures last spring highlight that responsive, efficient, and effective bank supervision is a strong mitigant for financial system risks and vulnerabilities. The failures revealed that shortcomings in bank supervision can heighten financial stability risks. The primary focus of supervision should be to address a bank's critical shortcomings in a timely way.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;To effectively support financial stability, bank supervision cannot simply rely on pinpointing compliance issues, failed processes, or rule violations. It must go further to examine a bank's risk exposures, including anticipating how the evolving economic environment may influence a bank's financial condition and its assessment of risks. If the supervisory process fails to identify and escalate critical risks, or to hold management accountable for known deficiencies, like excess interest rate risk and disproportionately large levels of uninsured deposits, this raises the potential for safety and soundness concerns.</p>
<p>Last year's bank stress also revealed that the Fed's bank liquidity and payments tools&mdash;including the Fed's discount window operations and FedWire&reg;&mdash;should be available for extended operating hours and prepared to provide support during times of stress. We should also consider what further steps may be needed to ensure that banks have access to liquidity support. In addition, we should encourage, but not mandate, the exercise of contingency funding plans and testing capabilities, requiring bank management to ensure adequate plans are in place.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;But there is a fine line between bank supervision and interfering in the decisions of bank management. Some measure of risk is inherent and necessary in the business of banking.</p>
<p>While some changes to the regulatory framework may be appropriate to promote financial stability, we should be cautious that these changes do not impair the long-term viability of banks, especially mid-sized and smaller banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;In my view, regulatory reform can pose significant financial stability risks, particularly if those regulatory changes fail to take sufficient account of the incentive effects and potential consequences, like pushing activity into the more opaque nonbank financial sector.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a>&nbsp;Poorly calibrated regulatory actions can also negatively affect economic activity and reduce the availability of credit by limiting the offering of other financial products or services. These concerns are most acute when the reforms may be inefficient or poorly targeted. As an example, policymakers should carefully consider whether the significant capital increases included in the U.S. Basel III proposal meet this standard of being efficient and appropriately targeted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn26" title="footnote 26"><span>26</span></a><a name="f26"></a></p>
<p><strong>What's Next for the Economy and Monetary Policy?</strong><br />Looking ahead, the FOMC will continue to face a number of risks and uncertainties as it seeks to return inflation to its 2 percent goal. It will be important to evaluate how these uncertainties and risks affect our monetary policy decisions going forward. As this audience knows, members of the FOMC consult a range of models that consider several scenarios and their potential economic outcomes using different benchmark monetary policy rules.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn27" title="footnote 27"><span>27</span></a><a name="f27"></a>&nbsp;This type of analysis can provide helpful input in informing my own views on the appropriate path of monetary policy. Given the importance of transparency, it is also necessary that our communications explain not only how the economic outlook affects our monetary policy decisions, often referred to as the FOMC's "reaction function," but also how the risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook matter for those decisions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I will conclude my remarks with my own views on the near-term economic outlook, including some prominent risks and uncertainties, and the implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p>At our most recent FOMC meeting, I supported keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and continuing to reduce our securities holdings. At its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. We have seen significant progress on lowering inflation over the past year while economic activity and the labor market have remained strong. Consumer services spending has shown continued strength through February, and payroll employment increased at a very strong pace in the first quarter.</p>
<p>However, most employment gains over the past year have been in part-time employment, and some of the recent strength in job gains may reflect stronger labor supply due to increased immigration. The 12-month readings of total and core PCE inflation through February printed at 2.5 and 2.8 percent, respectively, much lower than a year ago. However, with the annualized 3‑month PCE inflation readings moving well-above the 12‑month measures in February, I expect further progress in bringing inflation down to 2 percent will be slower this year.</p>
<p>Still, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady at its current level, and that the labor market will remain strong but with labor demand and supply gradually rebalancing as the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declines. And should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.</p>
<p>First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation. For example, the rebound in labor productivity last year may have reflected an unwinding of temporary pandemic-related labor market dynamics, such as a slowing in the high levels of employee turnover during that time. Therefore, if wage gains remain elevated going forward, these effects may no longer contribute to lower price inflation in the future.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences.</p>
<p>Another upside inflation risk I see is from additional fiscal stimulus or a higher spend-out rate from existing and new appropriations. Although some of the recent policies may increase productive capacity in the medium term, they may add to inflationary pressures by boosting aggregate demand.</p>
<p>I also see upside risks to housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of available and affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to certain regions could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. There is also a risk that continued labor market tightness and continued strong services demand could lead to persistently higher core services inflation. Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services.</p>
<p>Finally, there is uncertainty regarding whether the federal funds rate will need to remain at a higher level than before the pandemic in order to effectively foster low and stable inflation and support full employment. In my view, given potential structural changes in the economy, like higher investment demand relative to available savings, it is quite possible that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with low and stable inflation will be higher than before the pandemic. If that is the case, fewer rate cuts will eventually be appropriate to return our monetary policy stance to a neutral level. In the most recent SEP, some FOMC participants indicated that they now see fewer rate cuts over 2024 and over the next two years than in December. Some also included a higher longer-run level of the federal funds rate than in the past.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm#fn28" title="footnote 28"><span>28</span></a><a name="f28"></a></p>
<p>While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />To conclude, the experience over the past five years highlights the enduring challenge of setting forward-looking monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and uncertainties. Taking into account this experience and the lessons I have learned over my tenure on the FOMC, an important question I will be considering is how to make monetary policy strategy and its related communications durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in the macroeconomy. We will continue to learn about the post-pandemic economy, and, if history is any guide, new shocks to and changes in the economy will eventually and inevitably occur. While the future is full of risks and uncertainties, the FOMC's mandate of fostering price stability and maximum employment remains very clear. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. I look forward to our conversation.</p>

<div> Power, environmental, natural gas, trading, Nodal Exchange 
Summary: Nodal Exchange reports record trading volumes in Q1 2024 for power, natural gas, and environmental markets, showing strong performance and market leadership. <div>
<p>Nodal Exchange today announced strong performance in power, environmental, and natural gas trading in the first quarter of 2024.&nbsp;<span id="more-29583">&nbsp;</span>In power, Nodal posted a record quarter in Q1 2024 with 892 million MWh power futures volume traded, surpassing Q1 2022&rsquo;s record of 850 million MWh.&nbsp;Nodal continues to be the market leader in North American power futures having the majority of the open interest with 1.343 billion MWh, representing over $120 billion of notional value (both sides), at the end of March. &nbsp;This is roughly equivalent to the electricity usage of 124 million U.S. households for one year.</p>
<p>Nodal also had its second-best quarter trading in natural gas with 178 million MMBtu of traded volume in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>In the environmental markets, the first quarter volume across the product suite was 132,233 lots, up 95% from 67,711 lots a year earlier.&nbsp;Open interest at the end of Q1 2024 was 320,345 lots, up 42% from 226,306 at the end of Q1 2023.</p>
<p>Environmental market volume on Nodal Exchange set new monthly records in February of 50,085 lots, an all-time high, and a March record of 36,311 lots.</p>
<p>Broken down further, Nodal posted gains across renewable energy certificate (REC) and renewable fuel credit product sets.&nbsp; Open interest across all REC products hit a new high during Q1 of 263,172 contracts in February, while renewable fuels surpassed 46,000 lots.&nbsp;REC products continued their growth trend in open interest, with Texas CRS wind and CRS solar futures topping 63,000 contracts, also a new high, up 35% from a year earlier. Texas CRS led the group of 5 voluntary REC products listed on Nodal. Combined, voluntary REC open interest surpassed 70,000 lots during Q1, equal to more than 70 million MWh of renewable energy.&nbsp; These records highlight the work that Nodal and IncubEx have done to build these markets since November 2018. Nodal lists the largest suite of environmental products in the world with more than 120 futures and options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nodal Exchange is delighted with its strong first quarter results across asset classes and appreciates the ongoing market support of its community,&rdquo; said Paul Cusenza, Chairman and CEO of Nodal Exchange and Nodal Clear. &ldquo;Nodal Exchange is grateful to be able to offer the world&rsquo;s largest sets of power and environmental products and to be able to serve our markets&rsquo; risk management needs.&rdquo;</p>

<div> ACER, Dutch gas transmission tariffs, RPM, ACM, Network Code<br />
Summary:<br />
- ACER recommends ACM to compare proposed RPM with capacity weighted distance methodology
- ACM to publish representation of networks' structure and enhance future tariffs predictability
- ACM to include cost allocation assessment and further justify proposed discount at LNG entry points
- ACM to adopt motivated decision on new gas tariff methodology by 14 July 2024. <br /> <div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>What is it about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>ACER releases its report on the Dutch gas transmission tariffs, directed at Autoriteit Consument &amp; Markt (ACM), the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of the Netherlands. The report provides guidance on addressing the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff structures (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSUgVTV1BUVkwPAlcGHVZYDQ4dUFsAXhpWAAoCVlJRAgcJUgYdUQBbAA5QB1YdVwBRBB0GXQBRGg0HAQQZUQMBBwcHVQJZUVJQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>) when defining the gas transmission reference price methodology (RPM) for the period 2025&ndash;2029.</span></p>
<p><span>For the new methodology, building on the previous one, ACM proposes to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Apply the same postage stamp RPM of the past regulatory period (2020-2024).</span></li>
<li><span>Increase the discount at the storage facilities&rsquo; entry and exit points.</span></li>
<li><span>Introduce a discount at Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) facilities&rsquo; entry points.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>What does ACER say?</span></span></p>
<p><span>ACER identified several elements (required in the NC TAR) that are not adequately addressed in the consultation process established by ACM. Consequently, it is not possible to conduct a complete assessment on whether the methodology resulting from this process complies with the network code.</span></p>
<p><span>To address these concerns, ACER recommends ACM to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Compare the proposed RPM with the capacity weighted distance methodology, that reflects the current network characteristics and utilisation, and consider these findings when justifying the RPM.</span></li>
<li><span>Publish a representation of the networks' structure, including the relevant infrastructure changes compared to the previous motivated decision.</span></li>
<li><span>Enhance future tariffs predictability by incorporating forecasts of contracted capacity for 2025&ndash;2029, along with the methodology and assumptions used for their calculation.</span></li>
<li><span>Include a cost allocation assessment comparing different scenarios (with or without the storage and LNG discounts) for the relevant regulatory period.</span></li>
<li><span>Further justify the reasoning for the proposed discount at LNG entry points,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>clearly distinguishing the role of the discount as a means to increase security of supply.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>What are the next steps?</span></span></p>
<p><span>By 14 July 2024, ACM shall adopt a motivated decision on the new gas tariff methodology to be applied to the Dutch transmission network, taking into account ACER&rsquo;s recommendations.</span></p>

<div> Hurricanes, Katrina, Rita, peer effects, economic research <br />
Summary: Adriana Kugler discusses the importance of women's representation in the economics profession, using personal experience to inform economic research and policymaking. <div>
<p>Thank you, President Musalem, and many congratulations on the start of your new position here at the St. Louis Fed. We are all so happy to have you as part of the Federal Reserve System, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240404a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>I will start with the issue that has brought us here&mdash;why it is so important for women to be a full and equitably represented part of the economics profession. There are, of course, moral reasons for economics to reflect the values of our democratic society&mdash;it is the right thing to do. But there are eminently practical reasons as well. Economics favors the productive utilization of resources, and bringing more women into the profession obviously makes better use of the talents and efforts of more than half of the population. Greater diversity in a workforce yields better ideas and greater productivity, and the field of economics has certainly been enriched by these contributions.</p>
<p>But today, I would like to focus on the benefits of greater representation of women that accrue to economic research and policymaking&mdash;the way that you can make economic analysis more constructive and relevant. In a broad sense, different experiences and perspectives among those engaged in any social science should provide better insights about how people think and act. But I would like to take this point a step further and connect this issue of representation to the ways in which we approach economic research. In particular, I will describe how my own personal experience has been an important tool for me to use, in combination with the more familiar and rigorous tools of the economist, in ways that I believe have strengthened my research. In doing so, I also hope to show that personal experience can be used by you and others in our profession to provide deeper insights about the questions we grapple with. If this is true, it would constitute another way in which greater representation of women&mdash;and others with underrepresented backgrounds&mdash;will increase and enhance the valuable contributions that economics makes to society.</p>
<p>In my discussion, I will refer to some of my own past research to illustrate my general approach to economics. Importantly, though, my comments today are only illustrative of a general approach and are not commentary on any specific policy questions.</p>
<p>In explaining how I let personal experience and rigorous economic methodology inform each other, I am going to employ, in a somewhat casual way, two words that you may be familiar with. I think of a "deductive" approach as beginning with or relying on theory or general observations and then using data or qualitative evidence to verify those ideas in specific settings. For me, an "inductive" approach means beginning with personal experience and specific evidence from a particular context and then moving to more general lessons that we can draw on as economists about given issues or topics. In my career, I have found it fruitful to employ both of these approaches at different times, and often in succession or in alternation, to move from the specific to the general, developing a theory and then sometimes using specifics to test that theory.</p>
<p>Let me start with a little personal background, since that helped form my approach to research. I was born in the U.S. but grew up in Colombia. While there, my parents and I traveled around the country, where I observed a broad range of social problems: poverty, homelessness, child labor, and a lack of access to health care and other basic necessities. As a child, when you see suffering to this extent, you wonder about why and how it is occurring. Later, as an undergraduate, I found that economics offered tools that could help society understand and, I hoped, address some of these problems. What I started to see, and then saw more over time, was that in many ways the different social problems I observed were closely related to the opportunities people have to work and earn an income that reflects their effort and productivity as workers&mdash;in short, issues at the heart of labor economics. It also turned out that the tools of economics&mdash;for example, math and statistical analysis&mdash;were well suited to studying these questions and helped ground my work in objective reality. So I developed these skills by pursuing a Ph.D. in economics. During my career, I have conducted research on a range of topics, including labor markets, productivity, and social safety nets. And, as I will show, I have employed both the inductive and the deductive approaches that I have described here to formulate economic questions, rigorously examine data and evidence, and then test my conclusions.</p>
<p>The first example I want to share with you is a paper I wrote with Scott Imberman and Bruce Sacerdote on the relocation of families displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240404a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In 2005, I was a professor of economics at the University of Houston, in a city that was a major destination for people forced to evacuate from New Orleans and the surrounding area because of the hurricanes that year. Of the million people displaced by the hurricanes in 2005, Houston received 75,000 evacuees, many of them school-age children.</p>
<p>Houston was a fast-growing city with schools that already faced challenges, so people had questions about what effect this influx of new students might have on our local schools&mdash;now stretched for resources&mdash;and the students already attending them. It mattered to me as a member of the community with my own children attending those schools. Fortunately, economics provided tools to explore this question.</p>
<p>The question we considered was about "peer effects"&mdash;does the performance of your peers affect your own performance in school? How will students coming from other schools affect the outcomes for those already in Houston? The research literature showed some evidence of an effect, but the results were mixed. It is easy to imagine some reasons why peers could matter. A key challenge was that, even if we could find a relationship between the outcomes of the existing Houston students and their peers from Louisiana, that would not prove that the new students "caused" the outcomes of the existing Houston students. Classmates in the same classes with similar backgrounds could have similar outcomes for lots of reasons. But in this case, these new peers did not choose to attend certain schools based on pre-existing trends but instead were assigned to schools based on their shelter location, which is basically a random assignment&mdash;highly conducive to estimating causal effects. And the magnitude of this particular event was large enough to provide lots of variation in the composition of peers. I consider the approach we took to designing this study a good example of the power of deductive reasoning&mdash;developing a hypothesis and then finding the data by which to test it.</p>
<p>But we didn't just think about the data we started with. We had lots of discussions with school administrators and teachers. What they had to say about their experiences led us to explore ways in which the new students were affecting the existing ones, beyond grades and test scores&mdash;for example, behavior in schools and absenteeism. As any parent of school-age kids can tell you, these are obvious and significant factors in how students learn, and these discussions resonated for me as a parent with kids in school. My co-authors and I knew we had to make this part of our research.</p>
<p>Our basic approach in this paper was to relate changes in student outcomes with the prevalence of evacuee children in their district, controlling for a rich set of factors. Our conclusions were that in Houston, a large influx of evacuees did not generally have a large effect on test performance of local students. We did detect some negative effects in some subgroups, particularly in math. Motivated by discussions with teachers and administrators, we also found some small negative effects on attendance and behavior. Using traditional methods in economics, we conducted a number of what economists call "robustness checks," making sure that our assumption that the relocating families weren't picking school districts based on pre-existing trends held up, trying different ways of measuring outcomes or specifying models, and attempting to exclude alternative explanations, such as changes in teacher quality or educational resources.</p>
<p>Using these familiar methods, we had found that Houston schools were able to absorb the new students with little aggregate effect on local students. But that finding sent us back to think about the theories we had developed at the start of the project and the different reasons that make peers relevant to a student. In a sense, now that we had some results, what had started as a deductive analysis turned into an inductive one. And by examining the data more thoroughly, we discovered that a crucial factor in determining the impact of peers on academic outcomes was the extent to which students are grouped and interact with classmates of a similar academic ability level. Adding this dimension to our research, we found that peer effects were, in fact, stronger among cohorts of students with similar academic ability. It is a nuance to our overall finding of little significant effect and a result that I suspect would not have been attainable without the personal experience that I brought to the project as a parent&mdash;one of the factors that had motivated the work in the first place.</p>
<p>Let me offer a second example of this "inductive" approach, based on personal experience, and the interaction with a "deductive" approach that resulted in research that I am particularly proud of. As I said earlier, I taught at the University of Houston, a great school that has a very diverse student body, with people from all walks of life and at different stages of their lives. There were a lot of commuters, many still living at home with parents. There were also a lot of actual parents in my classes and people who had to work full-time jobs while completing their education. I once had a student who needed to reschedule a final exam because she had to go to court to fight for custody of her child. I had students who struggled to secure childcare to attend class, others who struggled with access to transportation to and from campus. The hurdles they often had to overcome were daunting. And while many obtained loans and other tuition assistance, the challenges they faced were multidimensional, and I often found myself thinking that their education would be much more successful if they had support in other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>I had written two papers on a training program in Colombia that included a stipend for workers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240404a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The stipend was intended to subsidize transportation for workers, with an extra amount for women that was intended to supplement their costs for childcare. The results found a significant boost to wages and employment from the training program, especially for women, and we found that the gains stayed with those workers for over a decade after the program. Moreover, we also found that the program encouraged workers and even their relatives to pursue more formal schooling&mdash;high school and even college. But these papers didn't allow me to explore the separate contribution of the stipend to the wage, employment, and educational gains we found. My own experience with students at the University of Houston suggested that this more comprehensive support for the workers in training was important, so I decided to follow up on my research.</p>
<p>So I wrote another paper&mdash;jointly with Felipe Barrera-Osorio and Mikko Silliman&mdash;based on an experiment we conducted in collaboration with a training program.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240404a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;In this experiment, we randomly offered stipends to some but not all workers. Students might use the stipend to pay for transportation to and from the program, or perhaps to help cover meals during the program, depending on what they saw as their most pressing needs. I like to call this a form of "wraparound" support; the stipend wraps around the main program to make it easier for people to participate. Some workers accepted to the training program were put in a class that focused on technical skills, and others in a class emphasizing social skills&mdash;again using random assignment. We found that participants saw an increase in employment, hours worked, and wages relative to workers who did not take the program, and the effects were greatest for women. Labor market outcomes improved more for those who received technical skills training, though this difference diminished after less than a year. And, lastly, we found that the effects of the program were indeed magnified by the stipend program. The "wraparound" support enhanced the value of the training program and likely helped mitigate the other labor market challenges faced by participants.</p>
<p>This paper again shows how insights gained from personal experience, combined with the deductive methods and tools of economics, can be the basis for good research. As I suspected from my experience with my University of Houston students, providing education is more effective, and the returns are higher, when students have some "wraparound" support that makes their lives a bit easier. We took this inductive approach and demonstrated it using standard tools of economics&mdash;randomization in a carefully designed experiment.</p>
<p>And this approach continued in my past work as a policymaker. At the U.S. Department of Labor and at the World Bank, I confronted questions that resonated for me with experiences I had had and earlier applied in my work as a researcher. At the Labor Department, I worked on workforce development issues, and we were able to include access to more comprehensive "wraparound" services to promote strong take-up and retention in these programs. When I was advocating for this approach, I thought about my students in Houston and those workers in Colombia, all of them trying to overcome big challenges and build a better life. And I was grateful then, and I'm grateful now, for my personal experiences, which didn't come from a textbook or a lecture but helped open my eyes to the answers to some of the important questions that economics strives to answer.</p>
<p>The research and policy work I have just described predate my time as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, and the policies I studied then are outside the purview of my current role. But I continue to apply the general approach of bringing my own experience, and the experiences I hear from others, together with the rigorous tools of economics. I listen to people from a range of communities and backgrounds to better understand the economic data and the statistical analysis we perform while working to make monetary policy decisions within the framework assigned to us by Congress that benefit all Americans.</p>
<p>So I will close my remarks by urging all of you to find ways to bring your unique experiences into your work in economics. I am a woman, a Latina, an immigrant, and a mother. As a person with this particular background, I have found that I have a unique perspective I can bring to the economics profession. By all means, build the technical skills you will need to prove your ideas; that is, indeed, critical in the economics profession. But don't be afraid to bring up your own perspective, based on your own experiences, when discussing economic issues. I think this is especially important for women, whose perspectives are still underrepresented in the profession.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to pursue a path in economics focused on research, policy, business, or some combination of these, you will make the greatest contribution by becoming a true expert on the issues you work on. You will accomplish this by refining your technical skills and, importantly, by bringing your unique perspective to each problem you seek to solve.</p>

<div> capitalisation, liquidity, return on equity, credit quality, MREL
Summary: 
EU/EEA banks report record high capitalisation and improved liquidity, but face early signs of credit quality deterioration. Profitability remains high. MREL information is included. <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its Q4 2023 quarterly Risk Dashboard (RDB), which discloses aggregated statistical information for the largest EU/EEA institutions. EU/EEA&rsquo;s banks capitalisation stands at record levels, liquidity has improved, while return on equity (RoE) stood at 10.3%. Yet, early signs of credit quality deterioration have become more apparent. The publication also includes information on minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL).</span></p>
<ul>
<li>EU/EEA banks reached record high capitalisation levels, with the weighted average common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio (fully loaded) at 15.9%, 50 bps higher than in December 2022. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) increased after several quarters of decline. The net stable funding ratio (NSFR) also slightly increased during the last quarter but remains close to levels reported during the last several quarters. The LCR and NSFR stand comfortably at 167% and 127%, respectively. Financial market conditions during the first months of 2024 were benign with high level of debt issuances from banks.</li>
<li>Loan and asset growth remained subdued, still affected by banks&rsquo; tightening of lending standards and lower demand. Risk weighted assets (RWAs) have increased slightly, driving RWA density higher mainly due to increased operational risk (from 9.6% to 10.1% of total RWA).</li>
<li>While asset quality remains robust, the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio increased slightly from 1.8% to 1.9%. Stage 2 loans and average cost of risk also increased during the last quarter of the year. NPLs collateralised by commercial real estate (CRE) increased marginally and the NPL ratio of these exposures was 4.3%.</li>
<li>EU/EEA banks' exposure to sovereigns increased slightly in 2023, after its decline in previous years.</li>
<li>Profitability for 2023 remained high at 10.3%, albeit with wide dispersion. &nbsp;While all banks have benefited from rising interest rates, the share of banks with a RoE higher than 10% has decreased from 60% to 45%.</li>

<div> Bank of England, CBDC Technology Forum, digital pound, interaction models, ledger technology <br />
<br />
Summary: The CBDC Technology Forum discussed interaction models for the digital pound and explored core ledger technology options for the Bank of England. <div>
<h4>Minutes</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Date of meeting: 8 February 2024</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h4 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome</h4>
<p>Tom Mutton (Chair) welcomed Members to the tenth meeting of the CBDC Technology Forum.</p>
<p>The Chair noted the agenda for the meeting would comprise presentations from two of the four subgroups that have been temporarily established to help explore the design options for the digital pound architecture. The Chair then invited members of Subgroups 2 and 3 to present the progress of their work to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h4 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Subgroup 2&rsquo;s presentation</h4>
<p>Members of Subgroup 2, tasked with exploring the models of interaction between PIPs, presented their findings. They explored three models of interaction between PIPs then defined use cases to assess against those models. The following models of interaction were explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model one was a centralised model in which PIPs could interact with each other through the core digital pound system operated by the Bank of England (the Bank).</li>
<li>Model two was a centralised model where PIPs could interact with each other through a third-party operator. This third-party operator could also facilitate PIPs&rsquo; interactions with the core systems operated by the Bank.</li>
<li>Model three was a decentralised model in which PIPs could interact with each other directly.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>They explored a range of use cases, from basic payment initiation to interoperability with different forms of money. They also made some preliminary assumptions to guide their assessment of the use cases, such as assuming the digital pound would be account based and that PIPs would be responsible for strong customer authentication.</p>
<p>They noted that their research did not reveal significant differences among the three models in terms of complexity of transactions, processing steps and the number of calls between parties, but further work would be needed to assess this practically. They explained, however, that model three would provide additional privacy assurances since all non-core data could pass directly between PIPs without reference to a third party or the Bank.</p>
<p>They explained that a key difference between the centralised approach of models one and two, and the decentralised approach of model three, was that the former could support standardisation across the network. The decentralised approach, however, would rely on PIPs to enforce standards.</p>
<p>Members of Subgroup 2 also presented their preliminary assessment on messaging standards. They explained that whereas ISO20022 standard provided a useful taxonomy and data dictionary, there were no specific ISO messages that, in their opinion, would be perfect for the digital pound. They highlighted complexities around ISO22002 noting that, since it was Extensible Markup Language (XML) based, it would be challenging to implement for the digital pound application programming interfaces (APIs). Their emerging thinking indicated that there were likely no messaging standards that could be adopted without modification for the digital pound.</p>
<p>They noted that a key area for their future exploration was key management and determining which parties should sign different messages and which parties would be able to check those signatures. They also expected to explore how the different models of interactions could operate in parallel and how a token-based assumption would affect their use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h4 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Subgroup 3&rsquo;s presentation</h4>
<p>Members of Subgroup 3, tasked with exploring core ledger technologies for the digital pound, presented their findings. They stated that their goals were to help identify options for core ledger technology and how those options would meet the requirements related to transaction speed, privacy and uptime that were set out in the Bank&rsquo;s Technology Working Paper. They considered both centralised and decentralised governance. They also considered distributed architectures.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2024/february/minutes-of-cbdc-technology-forum-february-2024#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>They explained that distributed ledger technology (DLT) models that achieve high consistency and trust but do not currently have high transaction speeds. Therefore, some members of Subgroup 3 suggested that layer 2 solutions would likely be needed to meet performance requirements. But centralised solutions might face similar performance constraints when trying to achieve high consistency.</p>
<p>They also presented their assessment on some centralised database systems and DLTs based on the maximum settlement rate and availability. They noted some technical requirements, such as achieving 30,000 transactions per second, favoured a centralised approach, but they did not have a final view on requirements such as availability. They reasoned that their assessment might vary based on functionality and use cases.</p>
<p>Members of Subgroup 3 asked the Bank whether they would use an off-the-shelf ledger solution for the digital pound. The Bank noted that this would be assessed further.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk163112246"></a><a id="_Hlk163112057"></a>Members of Subgroup 3 also wondered whether the core ledger would need to achieve 100% consistency. The Bank explained that consistency would be critical for confidence a digital pound.</p>
<p>Members of Subgroup 3 expected to explore ledger technology solutions in-depth and compare different options.</p>

<div> Bank of England, digital pound, subgroups, privacy, innovation
<br />
Subgroup 1 discussed privacy considerations and draft privacy model for the digital pound. Subgroup 4 proposed nine experiments for innovation platforms.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The meeting discussed privacy considerations for the digital pound, including cryptographic techniques, and proposed nine experiments for the Bank of England to consider for innovation platforms. <div>
<h4>Minutes</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Date of meeting: 30 January 2024</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h4 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome</h4>
<p>Tom Mutton (Chair) welcomed Members to the ninth meeting of the CBDC Technology Forum.</p>
<p>The Chair informed Members that a summary of responses to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-consultation-paper">Consultation Paper</a>&nbsp;and a summary of responses to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/the-digital-pound-technology-working-paper">Technology Working Paper</a>&nbsp;were published on January 25, 2024.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk158802608"></a>The Chair noted that the agenda for the meeting would comprise presentations from two of the four subgroups that have been temporarily established to help explore the design options for the digital pound architecture. The Chair then invited members of Subgroups 1 and 4 to present the progress of their work to date.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h4 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Subgroup 1 presentation</h4>
<p>Members of Subgroup 1, tasked with exploring technology options to ensure privacy in a digital pound and the design of the alias service, presented on Subgroup 1&rsquo;s approach and findings to date.</p>
<p>They stated that Subgroup 1&rsquo;s goals were to define the data access requirements for payments and to assess different solutions against those requirements. They noted that Subgroup 1&rsquo;s primary consideration was privacy, but there were other considerations that need to be adhered to, particularly as compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. They explained that those considerations could introduce challenges for achieving their requirements for privacy.</p>
<p>They also discussed Subgroup 1&rsquo;s draft privacy model, which considered different types of data, including account data, personal data and transaction data. It also considered different roles, such as payer, payee, Payment Interface Providers (PIPs), the ledger operator and the alias service operator. They explained that complexities would arise if the ledger operator was also the alias service operator, and it would be important to explore how PIPs would communicate with each other, whether that is directly or through the ledger operator.</p>
<p>They explained that there were cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, that could support privacy. However, work would be needed to determine the implications of those techniques for a digital pound system. They noted that there were other considerations that might impact their assessment of different technical solutions, including whether holding limits would be implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h4 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Subgroup 4 presentation</h4>
<p>Members of Subgroup 4, tasked with exploring the requirements for providing a platform for innovation, presented their initial findings. They explained that they would propose nine experiments for the Bank of England (the Bank) to consider commissioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first experiment would take examples from smart contract platforms and implement them against the API-based platform model of the digital pound to determine technical and legal feasibility.</li>
<li>The second experiment would involve the Bank creating a hub or sandbox that would enable technical stakeholders to develop innovative solutions and experiments using synthetic data.</li>
<li>The third experiment would explore technologies that could protect the privacy of user balances.</li>
<li>The fourth experiment would involve working with existing participants in the blockchain or distributed ledger technology space to explore potential use cases, such as a bridge component between the digital pound and Ethereum.</li>
<li>The fifth experiment would explore seamless omnichannel refunds, which would allow consumers to request refunds directly from their wallet applications.</li>
<li>The sixth experiment would explore how a digital pound could be implemented on a public chain.</li>
<li>The seventh experiment would explore an innovation platform that would sit above the core digital pound system and support innovation across all forms of money.</li>
<li>The eighth experiment would explore a common platform that would sit above the core digital pound system and support interoperability across all forms of money.</li>
<li>The ninth experiment would use electronic signatures to enable authorisation for tap-and-go transit payments.</li>
</ul>

<div> European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, DLT Pilot Regime, interim update, national competent authorities<br />
Summary:<br />
ESMA provides an update on the DLT Pilot Regime, including challenges, recommendations, and next steps for enhancing its functioning and competitiveness. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-04/ESMA75-117376770-460_DLT_Pilot_Regime_-_Letter_to_EU_Institutions.pdf">letter&nbsp;</a>to the European Commission, the Parliament, and the Council (ECOFIN) providing an interim update on the DLT Pilot Regime.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The letter provides an update on the status of applications received by national competent authorities (NCAs) to date, as well as a list of challenges and opportunities identified in the first year of application.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA has opted for this format instead of the report mandated under the DLT Pilot Regime because no DLT market infrastructures have been authorised under the Regime to date, rendering a full report premature. The letter provides recommendations to the European Commission to enhance the functioning and competitiveness of the Regime.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will continue to work closely with the NCAs, including by issuing opinions on the DLT market infrastructure applications, and will publish annual updates on the implementation of the DLT Pilot Regime.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">More information about the DLT Pilot Regime can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/dlt-pilot-regime">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h5><span>New AGM Voting Insight service pioneers shareholder voting analysis for Investor Relations</span></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><span>IR.Manager SaaS investor relation platform now enhanced with new enriched ESG data&nbsp;<a>on funds and investment organisations</a></span></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><a href="https://www.corporateservices.euronext.com/">Euronext Corporate Services</a>&nbsp;releases new solutions to support listed companies in their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy and their shareholder engagement with the launch of an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.corporateservices.euronext.com/shareholder-analysis">Annual General Meetings (AGM) Voting Insight solution</a>&nbsp;and a new version of its SaaS investor relation platform&nbsp;<a href="https://www.corporateservices.euronext.com/ir-manager">IR.Manager</a>, now including ESG data distribution.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">AGM Voting Insights is an innovative service that provides issuers with strategic shareholder intelligence and voting analytics before Annual General Meetings. This new service empowers companies to make informed decisions, optimise their engagement efforts, and align their strategies with voting trends. By leveraging real-time insights into AGM voting patterns, issuers can anticipate investor concerns, address governance issues proactively, streamline regulatory reporting, and ensure the success of their AGMs.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Alongside this major innovation, Euronext Corporate Services is also launching a new version of IR.Manager, its SaaS investor relation platform for listed companies, now offering a broad new range of ESG data on funds and investment organisations, which will enhance the user experience&nbsp; for investor relations professionals, and will support listed companies in their access to sustainable finance.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Together, these new services and solutions will provide listed companies with advanced ESG data, so they can be more prepared in their shareholder engagement.</p>
<h4><span>AGM Voting Insight brings a new dimension on shareholder visibility</span></h4>
<p class="BodyText1">Establishing and maintaining connections with key shareholders is crucial, particularly during critical decision-making events such as AGMs. Launched in partnership with Proxymity, AGM Voting Insight, a first-of-its-kind offering, equips European listed companies with early visibility of the voting intentions of their shareholders, empowering them with early and total visibility over who has voted and how, days before AGM.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The service enables issuers to gain granular insights into pre-AGM voting activity across resolutions and at the beneficial owners&rsquo; level. By leveraging real-time, in-depth voting analytics, issuers can identify trends, anticipate voting outcomes, tailor messaging, mitigate risks, and strengthen governance. AGM voting insight, together with Shareholder Analysis services also provided by Euronext Corporate Services, thus bring strategic intelligence for Investor relations teams who will now have extra time to engage with crucial shareholders before AGMs.</p>
<p>Key features of AGM Voting Insight include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-depth analysis of vote resolutions at the beneficial owner level</li>
<li>Enriched investor contact data to facilitate engagement</li>
<li>Real-time updates from the publication of AGM resolutions</li>
<li>Visibility into institutional voter patterns and trends</li>
<li>Intelligence to align messaging and engagement strategies</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="BodyText1"><span>IR.Manager SaaS investor relation platform enriched with new ESG data</span></h4>
<p class="BodyText1">Euronext Corporate Services launches new ESG data into IR.Manager, its SaaS investor relations platform, providing listed companies with a comprehensive ESG dataset on funds and investment organisations, powered by Morningstar&reg;.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">As sustainability increasingly influences investment decisions, investor relations professionals need to analyse their shareholders and prospect investors with more information on their ESG profile and performance. The ESG data now available in IR.Manager enables investor relations professionals to better identify and target investors, giving them the access to funds&rsquo; rating and non-financial investment approach, in order for them to better align their investors&rsquo; engagement with their own ESG trajectory.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Mathieu Caron, Head of Primary Markets at Euronext said: &ldquo;<em>We are thrilled about these new releases to our suite of ESG solutions. In a world where shareholder engagement and sustainable finance are becoming central to the life of listed companies, we are delighted to provide cutting-edge tools to better connect our customers to the investment universe and for the preparation of their Annual General Meetings.</em>&nbsp;<em>Euronext is actively committed to supporting listed companies in their investor dialogue and ESG strategy, acknowledging its significance in investment decisions.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> Fiserv Small Business Index, sales, small businesses, March 2024, consumer spending
Summary:<br /><br />The Fiserv Small Business Index for March 2024 reflects a one-point decline, with small business sales growing year-over-year but declining month-over-month. Notably, restaurants saw increased spending, while retail sales softened compared to February. Additionally, certain subsectors, such as food manufacturing and web search portals, experienced growth in March. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index reflects one point decline from February 2024</i></li>
<li><i>Small business sales grew +2.0% year-over-year, while declining -0.8% month-over-month</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="March 2024 Fiserv Small Business Index Values (Graphic: Business Wire)" src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20240404737908/en/2089102/4/Fiserv_Small_Business_Index_2_March_2024.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiserv.com%2F&amp;esheet=53922284&amp;newsitemid=20240404737908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Fiserv%2C+Inc.&amp;index=1&amp;md5=4f436af4b74a40741fc3ca114f83a266" rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank">Fiserv, Inc.</a><span>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index</span><span>&trade;</span><span>&nbsp;for March 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the performance of small businesses in the United States at national, state, and industry levels.</span></p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiserv.com%2Fen%2Ffiserv-small-business-index.html&amp;esheet=53922284&amp;newsitemid=20240404737908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Fiserv+Small+Business+Index&amp;index=2&amp;md5=eab5a93289bb02c2709bc0d480dc39b2" rel="nofollow" shape="rect" target="_blank">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;decreased one point to 141. Small business sales grew +2.0% year-over-year, while declining -0.8% month-over-month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending fluctuated throughout March, with Spring Break travel boosting sales and the Easter holiday contributing to a slow finish as many small businesses closed on the month&rsquo;s final day,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Restaurants were a particularly bright spot in March, with small businesses in this subsector seeing a +4.0% increase in spending over February and a +5.8% increase over March 2023. As in the past few months, consumers again devoted the biggest share of their spending at small businesses to dining out.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Retail Spotlight</b></h4>
<p>Nationally, sales at retail small businesses were soft compared to February (-1.6%) but trended well ahead of March 2023 (+5.1%). Some of the month-over-month slowdown can be attributed to the fact that many small businesses opted to close in observance of the Easter holiday on March 31. While most subsectors within the Retail sector experienced a month-to-month deceleration in sales, every subsector was ahead of its 2023 results. The strongest performer among the Retail subsectors was Clothing, Accessories, Shoes, and Jewelry, which delivered growth of +0.4% over February.</p>
<h4><b>Additional Small Business Insights</b></h4>
<p>Spring Break travel and celebrations also contributed to sizeable sales increases in the Accommodation subsector encompassing hotels and short-term vacation rentals, which grew +3.5% month-over-month and the Amusement, Gambling, and Recreational Industries subsector, which grew +4.1% month-over-month and +10.5% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Food Manufacturing was the most active small business subsector in March, with its index increasing 9 points to 175. Sales for small businesses in this subsector grew +5.2% from February 2024, and +14.0% over 2023.</p>
<p>Other growing subsectors in March included: Web Search Portals, Libraries, Archives, and Other Information Services (+5.6% month-over-month, +16.1% year-over-year), Personal and Laundry Services (+3.1% month-over-month, +3.2% year-over-year), and Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries (+2.3% month-over-month, +1.8% year-over-year).</p>
<h4><b>About the Fiserv Small Business Index<span>&trade;</span></b></h4>
<p>The Fiserv Small Business Index is published during the first week of every month and differentiated by its direct aggregation of consumer spending activity within the U.S. small business ecosystem. Rather than relying on survey or sentiment data, the Fiserv Small Business Index is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online, across approximately 2 million U.S. small businesses.</p>
<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic. Through a simple interface, users can access data by region, state, and/or across business types categorized by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Computing a monthly index for 16 sectors and 34 sub-sectors, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a timely, reliable and consistent measure of small business performance even in industries where large businesses dominate.</p>

<div> Blockchain, transfer agent, fund service provider, digital share class, tokenization
Summary:
Apex Group, in partnership with Hamilton Lane and Sygnum Bank, is the first transfer agent to administer regulated securities using blockchain, allowing access to a larger pool of qualified investors. They have created a new digital share class and DLT registry to automate fund administration functions, regulated by the CSSF in Luxembourg. This will enable asset management clientele to sell more of their product. <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Apex Group has become the first&nbsp;transfer agent and fund service provider to administer regulated securities, using blockchain as the book of record. This ground-breaking approach enables global private market funds to access a more diverse and significantly larger pool of qualified investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In partnership with Hamilton Lane and Sygnum Bank, Apex Group created a new digital share class of the Hamilton Lane GPA fund, and a DLT registry, to automate and integrate traditionally separate fund administration functions. Tokenisation of the fund creates a digital share class, and a DLT registry to manage its distribution and administration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Apex Group is regulated by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) in Luxembourg, to manage investor onboarding (AML/KYC), subscription, administration, and transfer agency of a fund&rsquo;s traditional, and now digital share classes. Apex Group will increasingly utilise this operating model for all of its asset management clientele, in turn enabling them to sell more of their product.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Peter Hughes, Chief Executive Officer of Apex Group</span><span>, said:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;This is a game-changer for Apex Group, and the industry as a whole. We are focused on disrupting traditional practices in order to drive positive change throughout the financial services sector and this is an example of optimising technology for industry advancement.&rdquo;</span><span><br /></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Bruce Jackson, CFA, Apex Group Chief of Digital Asset Funds and Business&nbsp;</span><span>also commented:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Our goal is to enable distributors and wealth managers to have increased access to our clients&rsquo; alternative strategies. We will continue to perfect our Framework Operating Model for the distribution of alternative asset funds using blockchain as the subscription, onboarding, operating, administration, and transfer agency platform.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Secures £1.6m For Investors From Alleged Unlawful Investment Schemes</title>

<div> Secured, court approval, £1.6m, investment schemes, unlawful
<br />
The FCA secured court approval to obtain £1.6m from Argento Wealth Ltd and its director, Daniel Willis, due to alleged unlawful investment schemes, with the intention to return the money to investors.
<br /><br />Summary: The FCA obtained £1.6m from Argento Wealth Ltd and its director due to alleged unlawful investment schemes, to be returned to investors. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has secured court approval to obtain &pound;1.6m from Argento Wealth Ltd (AWL) and its sole director Mr Daniel Willis, who promoted 2 alleged unlawful investment schemes.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA previously commenced civil proceedings against AWL and Mr Willis to recover investor funds linked to the firm&rsquo;s alleged unlawful activity, with the regulator successfully securing undertakings which froze AWL&rsquo;s/Mr Willis&rsquo; assets.</p>
<p>The High Court has now approved a consent order, with the intention that the money is returned to investors in the schemes.</p>
<p>The FCA alleged that AWL unlawfully:</p>
<ul>
<li>took approximately &pound;2.8m as deposits under loan agreements and/or as part of an unauthorised collective investment scheme</li>
<li>arranged investments in EMB Fund Limited (EMB) totalling about US$9m which&nbsp;breached the restrictions on financial promotion</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The FCA also alleged that Mr Wills was knowingly concerned in this unlawful activity.</p>
<p>AWL and Mr Willis have not admitted any of the FCA&rsquo;s allegations that led to the proceedings, which began on 1 June 2022, but have agreed to pay money to the FCA intended for the eventual distribution to investors.</p>
<p>Further court hearings are required to decide how and to whom the funds secured in this agreement should be distributed. This process may take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>The settlement agreed by the FCA was intended to prevent all of AWL/Mr Willis&rsquo; remaining assets from being used up to meet the ongoing legal and living costs. Without the settlement, there would have been a significant risk of the remaining investor money being used to fund legal fees, leaving nothing for investors. Despite the settlement, investors will suffer very significant losses.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well.&nbsp;To support this, it has 3 operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.&nbsp;</li>

<li>AWL is not, and never has been, an FCA authorised firm. Almost all firms offering financial services in the UK must be authorised and registered by the FCA. Members of the public should&nbsp;<a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/" target="_blank" title="Financial Services Register">check our register</a>&nbsp;to find out if a firm or individual is unauthorised.

The IOSCO published a Consultation Report on changes in exchanges' organizational structures, regulatory considerations, and good practices for supervision.<br /><br />Summary: The report discusses changes in exchanges, regulatory considerations, and outlines good practices for supervision. <div>
<p>The International Organization for Securities Commissions (IOSCO) today published a Consultation Report on&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD763.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C8501fe9928a84d66b77f08dc5487abfb%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638478188888204828%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=pFH0U6x2QqlF8HqjT21bEdfGBqluYUMicwSH5DNzUuA%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"><em>Evolution in the Operation, Governance and Business Models of Exchanges: Regulatory Implications and Good Practices</em></a>.</p>
<p>The Consultation Report analyzes the structural and organizational changes within exchanges, focusing on business models and ownership structures. It highlights a shift towards more competitive, cross-border, and diversified operations as exchanges integrate into larger corporate groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Consultation Report discusses regulatory considerations, particularly in the organization of individual exchanges and Exchange Groups<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and the supervision of Multinational Exchange Groups. It addresses potential conflicts of interest arising from matrix structures and the challenges of overseeing individual exchanges within Exchange Groups.</p>
<p>Additionally, it outlines a set of six good practices for regulators to consider in the supervision of exchanges, particularly when they provide multiple services and/or are part of an Exchange Group. The good practices are also complemented by a non-exclusive list of supervisory tools used by IOSCO jurisdictions to address the issues under discussion, in the form of &ldquo;toolkits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While the Consultation Report focuses on equities listing trading venues, the findings are also relevant to other trading venues, including non-listing trading venues and derivatives trading venues.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Bank of America and State Street to support launch of Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s clearing service for securities financing transactions</li>
<li>Brings total number of launch participants to nine, comprising a broad range of key market participants, including banks, clearing firms, asset managers and custodians</li>
<li>Launch on track for Q3 2024, subject to regulatory approvals</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Cboe Clear Europe, Cboe&rsquo;s Amsterdam-based pan-European clearing house, today announced that it has secured the support of additional participants to support the launch of its Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing service for securities financing transactions (SFTs). Bank of America and State Street have committed to supporting the service from launch, which is expected during Q3 2024, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Their commitment brings the total number of launch participants for the SFT clearing service to nine, comprising a broad range of key market participants, including banks, clearing firms, asset managers and custodians. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="BasicParagraph">Borrower Participants: ABN AMRO Clearing Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan</li>
<li class="BasicParagraph">Agent Lender Participants: BNY Mellon, Citibank and State Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><b>Vikesh Patel, President, Cboe Clear Europe</b>, said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;We are delighted to have added two major participants in the European securities lending industry to the group of firms supporting the launch of the SFT service and benefit from their collective expertise as we finalise our offering. Their recent commitment &ndash; and the calibre of the group of early adopters we have assembled as a whole &ndash; clearly demonstrates the growing need to introduce central clearing to the European SFT market and help reduce risk in this key activity. Cboe Clear Europe is uniquely positioned to provide this service and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to bring our proven post-trade expertise to a new asset class with the support of our partners, delivering significant capital, operational and risk-mitigation efficiencies.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><b>Alessandro Cozzani, Managing Director, Bank of America</b>, said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;We are excited to embark on this journey with Cboe Clear Europe. Developing a cleared product for securities lending is a natural evolution in our secured financing market, which should allow for greater risk optimisation with counterparties.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">As previously announced, this new service is expected to introduce matching, CCP clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management for SFT transactions in European cash equities and ETFs. Subject to regulatory approval, the service will be available to principal lenders, special participant lenders (UCITS and non-UCITS) and borrowers, with settlement taking place in 19 European Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) with non-cash RQV managed at 2 Tri-Party Collateral Agents and cash RQV via cash correspondent banks. Because European SFTs primarily&nbsp;occur&nbsp;on a bilateral basis and are not cleared, the products face significantly increased capital demands and credit risk limitations as a result of new regulations including the implementation of the Basel III endgame and Basel IV frameworks through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The impact of such regulations may lead to a reduced capacity and appetite to borrow or lend.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">By offering access to a CCP&nbsp;clearing and settlement service for SFTs, Cboe Clear Europe is expected to&nbsp;help clients address these new rules, reduce their risk-weighted assets exposures associated with bilateral SFTs and help support the growth of this vital market. The service is expected to also bring significant operational advantages including greater settlement efficiency leading to a reduction in fail fines, elimination of agent lender disclosures, and improved practices around fees management, corporate actions, and post-trade lifecycle processing.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><b>Jan Treuren, SFT Product Lead, Cboe Clear Europe</b>, said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The addition of Bank of America and State Street demonstrates the growing momentum behind our service as we approach its launch and our commitment to delivering innovative client-driven services. We are working closely with all of our launch participants to help shape the first phase of our SFT service offering through a series of regular working groups and key stakeholder meetings. This includes exploring expansion of the service into other assets classes and jurisdictions. At launch, Cboe Clear Europe will be the only pan-European CCP offering these consolidated services for SFTs in European cash equities and ETFs.&rdquo;</i></p>

<div> inflation, economic developments, supply and demand, labor market, monetary policy
<br />
Summary: The author discusses recent economic developments, including inflation dynamics, supply and demand in goods and services, labor market conditions, and the current stance of monetary policy. <div>
<p>Thank you, Andrew, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I am very pleased to be talking here at the Weidenbaum Center. As an economist currently working on policy, but with a long trajectory in research, I particularly appreciate the center's multidisciplinary approach to building bridges between these two applications of economics.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been working to lower inflation in the context of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Today I will discuss economic developments in the U.S. and how I view the current stance of monetary policy in light of recent data and longer-run trends. Since I am an economist, you will not be surprised that I will talk about recent economic developments by highlighting the dynamics of supply and demand.</p>
<p>As you all know, inflation began to rise in 2021. By mid-2022, 12-month inflation, based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, was around 7 percent&mdash;much too high and far above the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run objective. But since that time, PCE inflation has slowed significantly, declining to 5.4 percent at the end of 2022, then to 2.6 percent at the end of 2023, and then to 2.5 percent in February.</p>
<p>Inflation can sometimes be hard to read from overall PCE inflation figures due to the volatility of food and energy prices. For that reason, it is sometimes helpful to focus on "core" PCE inflation, which excludes those categories and is a better guide to the direction of inflation. Core PCE inflation peaked at a rate above 5-1/2 percent in early 2022 but fell rapidly during 2023. In fact, the core PCE disinflation we saw last year was the fastest since the early 1980s. The progress has sometimes been bumpy from month to month, and, indeed, January and February of this year showed a bit of firming in the inflation data. But the January numbers, in particular, featured some atypical or seasonal factors that suggest a need to withhold judgment. The 12-month core PCE rate now stands at 2.8 percent. That rate represents considerable progress, but it is still meaningfully above the FOMC's 2 percent target.</p>
<p>I like to think about core PCE inflation in terms of three main components: goods, housing services, and non-housing services. Twelve-month inflation for core goods peaked first, reaching about 7-1/2 percent in early 2022. But goods inflation cooled quickly, and in February goods prices were nearly half a percentage point below their level a year ago. Services inflation peaked later and has cooled less quickly. Within services, housing services&mdash;a measure of the cost of rent, and the equivalent for owner-occupied housing&mdash;rose above 8 percent early last year but was 5.8 percent in February. Housing services inflation is naturally persistent because tenant rents often have year-long lease agreements, and estimates of owner-occupied housing costs are imputed based in large part using those tenant rents. Data on new tenant rent agreements suggest that housing inflation broadly will continue to cool. Finally, inflation in core non-housing services hovered between 4-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent from mid-2021 through mid-2023 but began cooling after that, reaching 3.3 percent in February. Continued disinflation will indeed require further progress in housing and non-housing services.</p>
<p>The rise and subsequent easing of inflation in recent years were related to both supply and demand factors. This development has been confirmed by granular, "bottom-up" statistical research looking at price and quantity changes within narrow product categories. Roughly speaking, if a price goes up while quantity goes down, that is an indication that a negative supply shock is dominating; if price and quantity move in the same direction, that is an indication that a demand shock is dominating. Research using this method finds that, for the economy broadly, demand shocks accounted for roughly two-thirds of the 2021 pickup in, and 2023 slowing of, core PCE inflation, with the remaining one-third related to supply. The role of supply is somewhat larger in a narrower analysis focused on the domestic manufacturing sector.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;"Top-down" research looking at aggregate time-series data also found significant contributions for both supply and demand factors.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Let me be a bit more concrete about this point by discussing supply and demand for goods and services in turn. Supply in some goods-producing industries, like motor vehicles, was held down for some time by pandemic-related plant shutdowns, shortages, and transportation bottlenecks. And demand for goods surged during the pandemic when consumers shied away from in-person services. Businesses frequently highlighted shortages of materials as having held down production during the period when supply was tight and demand was strong. Those pressures have eased considerably (though perhaps not completely). Supply chains and production have largely recovered, and there are signs that goods demand growth since then has eased. For example, the share of consumer spending devoted to goods rather than services has moved back closer to its pre-pandemic trend after rising sharply in 2020.</p>
<p>Regarding services, particularly non-housing services, the most important input to services production tends to be labor.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;For that reason, it is useful to talk about supply and demand for labor. Labor supply was held down significantly in the early stages of the pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in some cases, involuntarily stayed out of the workforce. Older workers, in particular, left the labor force in a wave of early retirements, and, tragically, COVID‑19 caused a rise in mortality. Additionally, many prime-age workers&mdash;those between the ages of 25 and 54&mdash;stayed out of the labor market for a time, perhaps because of health concerns or family care challenges. And immigration was relatively low during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But labor supply has been recovering. While most older individuals have not, as a whole, returned to the labor force, many prime-age workers have. Prime-age women, in particular, have significantly increased their labor force participation, which reached an all-time high last year and remains close to that all-time high. Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that net immigration increased to above 2-1/2 million in 2022 and 3-1/2 million in 2023. If the CBO analysis is correct, population growth has been a sizable contributor to overall labor force growth.</p>
<p>A more subtle source of labor supply improvement has been improved quality of matches between workers and firms&mdash;how well suited particular workers are, by talent, experience, and preferences, to their employers. In the wake of, and until the end of, the pandemic, we saw a heightened pace of workers quitting their jobs and finding new ones, a process that economists generally believe improves matches. Indeed, evidence suggests workers and firms have been fairly efficient at finding each other over the past couple of years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;High-quality job matches act like additional labor supply: Both firms and workers are likely to be more productive when workers' skills and preferences are a good match for their employers' needs.</p>
<p>On the demand side, labor demand was strong in 2021 and 2022. Demand was so strong, in fact, that the job openings rate&mdash;that is, the monthly number of job openings relative to total employment&mdash;ran almost 50 percent above its pre-pandemic record all the way from July 2021 through July 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>But the job openings rate has declined roughly 30 percent from its peak, a sign that labor demand&mdash;while still robust&mdash;has cooled significantly. So the labor market has moved into better balance.</p>
<p>Importantly, given the strong labor supply growth, supply&ndash;demand imbalances can continue to ease even amid a solid pace of net job growth, as we have been seeing. Indeed, I suspect that strong population growth helps resolve the puzzle that forecasters have faced over the past year, in which measures of labor market growth&mdash;and growth of other economic variables, like consumption&mdash;have been solid even amid easing inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>As labor markets have moved into better balance, wage growth has cooled&mdash;which means that increases in the main cost business in the services sector have slowed, easing inflationary pressures. Workers and families do not reap the benefit of higher wages if those gains are eaten up by inflation. For that reason, it is important that wage growth be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. The U.S. economy is moving back toward that kind of wage growth, including in services industries: The 12-month growth of average hourly earnings in private services has come down to about 4 percent from a peak pace above 6 percent in early 2022. And despite the cooling of wage growth, with inflation easing over the past year, we have seen broader wage increases again outpacing price gains, that is, real wage gains.</p>
<p>But you may ask: What role has the FOMC played in all of this? While supply conditions are beyond the control of monetary policymakers, the FOMC can influence the pace of inflation by tightening monetary policy to slow the growth of aggregate demand. The FOMC began raising its policy interest rate in early 2022 and proceeded expeditiously. These actions have damped aggregate demand, with the most pronounced effects on interest rate&ndash;sensitive sectors. For example, in 2023, the level of residential investment was about 19 percent below its 2021 level, reflecting a much lower pace of home purchases. And business investment in machines has seen somewhat tepid growth lately, even contracting a bit last year, though I note that the construction of new factories has been surging, perhaps partly related to recent legislation, which will boost supply over the longer run. More broadly, financial conditions have been a drag on aggregate demand, as suggested by the Federal Reserve Board's FCI-G (Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth) index, which estimates the overall effect on gross domestic product (GDP) of changes in financial conditions, including interest rates, asset prices, and exchange rates. This measure moved well into restrictive territory in mid-2022 and remained quite restrictive for some time, though it has become less restrictive recently.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct actions taken to tighten monetary policy, the FOMC has also helped cool inflation through its communication with the public. In particular, the FOMC's stated commitment to bring inflation back to 2 percent, coupled with its actions to tighten policy, has helped ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored&mdash;that is, that households and firms believe that inflation will return to the Committee's target. Anchored expectations are evident in surveys of consumers conducted by the University of Michigan and the New York Fed. Separately, a Richmond Fed survey shows a close relation between firms' expectations of overall inflation and their own price-setting plans. As the effects of earlier supply and demand shocks fade, firms with anchored inflation expectations will bring their price-setting decisions back into alignment with the FOMC's inflation target. One way they might do so is by adjusting their prices less frequently. Before the pandemic, the typical price lasted more than 10 months, but by early 2022, it was lasting fewer than 5 months while inflation was near its recent peak. Since then, the frequency of price adjustments has slowed considerably, and by the fourth quarter of last year, the typical price was lasting more than 7 months.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Let me now turn to the outlook for this year. Given my thinking about the role of supply and demand in recent inflation dynamics, as well as the role anchored inflation expectations are playing in bringing price-setting behavior back to normal, I expect the disinflationary trend to continue.</p>
<p>There is still a bit of room for further supply improvement, especially in the services sector, where solid labor supply growth will continue to ease wage and inflation pressures.</p>
<p>On the demand side, I expect consumption growth to slow some this year, as households have drawn down large balances of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and are facing restrictive financial conditions. We may already be seeing some of that slowing; consumer spending was soft in January and February, on average, suggesting that we are on track for lower consumption growth in the first quarter than we saw during the second half of last year.</p>
<p>With less support from consumers, I expect GDP growth this year to be solid but slower than last year's strong 3.1 percent pace. Even with demand growth cooling, given the backdrop of solid supply, my baseline expectation is that further disinflation can be accomplished without a significant rise in unemployment.</p>
<p>That said, the future is uncertain, and I am attentive to risks&mdash;both upside risks to my inflation outlook and downside risks to the outlook for economic activity. For upside risks, global developments such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East could spark an increase in commodity prices or further disruptions to shipping networks. The tragic recent bridge collapse in Baltimore and effects on the Port of Baltimore could also pose some risk, though it appears that shipping networks are adapting. Additionally, consumption growth could turn out to be stronger than expected, particularly because of the wage gains we have seen across all income groups&mdash;but especially among the lowest earners who have an especially high propensity to spend out of their income.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Indeed, consumption was surprisingly strong last year and made solid contributions to GDP growth in the third and fourth quarters, though some of that strength may have been related to strong population growth which, more generally, was likely disinflationary.</p>
<p>But there are also downside risks to economic activity. Measures of consumer credit delinquencies have been on the rise, which might point to a more significant slowing of consumer spending than expected. And labor markets can sometimes deteriorate very quickly, without much warning in closely watched spending data. The February employment report featured a rise in the unemployment rate, half of which was accounted for by layoffs. I study a range of layoff indicators, both in the official data and in measures based on information contained in publicly traded firms' earnings reports or Google searches, and I will continue to watch a whole range of indicators closely.</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly discuss monetary policy. As I have noted, policy is currently restrictive, and my baseline expectation is that disinflation will continue without a broad economic slowdown&mdash;though such an outcome is not assured.</p>
<p>In considering the appropriate path of monetary policy, I am guided by the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. After the March FOMC meeting, the Committee said that it "does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240403a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;After that meeting, we also published the Summary of Economic Projections, which summarizes the forecasts of FOMC participants. Most FOMC participants expect that it will be appropriate to begin lowering the federal funds rate sometime this year. My own expectation is consistent with that; if disinflation and labor market conditions proceed as I am currently expecting, then some lowering of the policy rate this year would be appropriate.</p>
<p>However, I will remain attentive to the totality of the data and be prepared to change my economic and policy outlook if conditions change.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. For explaining core PCE inflation generally, see Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), "Decomposing Supply and Demand Driven Inflation," Working Paper Series 2022-18 (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, October; revised February 2024), available at&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.24148/wp2022-18">https://doi.org/10.24148/wp2022-18</a>. With regard to the manufacturing sector specifically, recent work by the Federal Reserve Board staff focused on manufacturing production and producer price indexes and used additional supply information from the Census Bureau's Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization. That research found a roughly 50&ndash;50 split between supply and demand. See Robin Braun, Aaron Flaaen, and Sinem Hacioglu Hoke (2024), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/supply-vs-demand-factors-influencing-prices-of-manufactured-goods-20240223.html">Supply vs Demand Factors Influencing Prices of Manufactured Goods</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 23).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. See Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417">What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?</a>" NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, labor costs are more than 80 percent of value-added in education and health services and nearly 60 percent in leisure and hospitality services. See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2023), "<a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=gdpxind">Interactive Data</a>," tables on composition of gross output by industry, December.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. For example, one popular measure of "matching efficiency" shows an initial decline early in the pandemic but a robust recovery to pre-pandemic levels. See Simon Mongey and Jeff Horwich (2023), "<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/are-job-vacancies-still-as-plentiful-as-they-appear-implications-for-the-soft-landing">Are Job Vacancies Still as Plentiful as They Appear? Implications for the 'Soft Landing'</a>" (Minneapolis, Minn.: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, December 1).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. The pre-pandemic record job openings rate was 4.8 percent in late 2018 and early 2019. The rate averaged 7.1 percent from July 2021 through July 2022. The absolute peak job openings rate was 7.4 percent in March 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. For an analysis of the implications of CBO population estimates for labor markets and consumer spending, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson (2024), "New Immigration Estimates Help Make Sense of the Pace of Employment" (Washington: Hamilton Project, Brookings Institution, March 7), available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-employment/">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-employment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. These facts are from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/price-setting-during-the-covid-era-20230829.html">Price-Setting during the Covid Era</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29). I thank the authors for providing me with updated data through 2023:Q4.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Since the pandemic, workers at the low end of the wage distribution have seen the strongest wage growth, which is apparent in the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker. For a discussion, see the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/20240301_mprfullreport.pdf">Monetary Policy Report (PDF)</a>: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2024),&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>&nbsp;(Washington: Board of Governors, March).&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Director, SEC, Division of Examinations, compliance, resiliency, adaptability
<br />
Summary:
Rich Best, Director of SEC's Division of Examinations, emphasizes the importance of strong compliance, resiliency, and adaptability for investor protection and market stability. <div>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Rich Best, the Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my pleasure to welcome you to the Examinations Panel of SEC Speaks, where we&rsquo;ll have leadership from across the Division of Examinations, the Office of Credit Ratings, and the Office of Municipal Securities here to talk about aspects of their programs.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Grace O&rsquo;Hanlon for making today&rsquo;s program a success&mdash;thank you Grace!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll share a few brief words before turning to our deputy director, Keith Cassidy, to get the panel started.</p>
<p>But before I begin, allow me to remind everyone that:</p>
<p>My remarks are provided in my official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Examinations but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>Now with that out of the way, let me share a few thoughts about EXAMS, our work and the importance of adequate support for compliance.</p>
<p>Technology allows us to reach industry leaders, compliance professionals, investors, and other groups, so we view this as an important opportunity to discuss a few critical items that we believe will greatly enhance investor protection and market stability. &nbsp;Two key items are the importance of resiliency and adaptability. We live in a world of constantly changing risk and opportunity.</p>
<p>As a result, compliance officers and their staff must remain vigilant and scan the horizon for new and emerging risks to ensure their compliance programs continue to offer appropriate assistance and guidance to their firms, and strong protection to investors.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s new and emerging technologies, new financial products, or new risks and threats under the cyber umbrella, industry leaders, including, CCOs and their staff, must invest in remaining current, nimble, resilient, and adaptable.</p>
<p>And so do we.</p>
<p>We have a shared interest in ensuring robust investor protection through strong compliance. &nbsp;In EXAMS, we are focused on that goal and realize that CCOs and other compliance professionals play a critical role in achieving it for investors.</p>
<p>Part of that is continuously surveying the industry landscape, and adapting to new risks, new threats, and new ways to protect investors by evolving with our ever-changing market environment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just participating in events like today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It must also include providing tangible resources and support to compliance professionals to ensure that firms are meeting their regulatory responsibilities and investors are adequately protected.</p>
<p>Our team in EXAMS have worked hard to do our part in this regard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will hear more over the next two days about our increased issuance of risk alerts, changes to our industry and investor outreach, adjusting the timing of our priorities, and our proactive steps to respond to critical events in the market.</p>
<p>As you listen to our EXAMS leaders, you should take note of these changes which are intended to offer important support to compliance departments and in other areas of leadership across the securities industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to us&mdash;and more importantly, to investors&mdash;that compliance departments, have the proper resources and support to meet regulatory responsibilities.</p>
<p>That compliance professionals are able to leverage EXAMS&rsquo; focal points as they engage in their own planning and business discussions.</p>
<p>And that firms are incentivized to make these investments&mdash;not only because it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s required, but also because it&rsquo;s in their best interest to secure a better future for investors and their business. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the themes of strong compliance, resiliency, and adaptability resonate with many of you here today as you participate in our panel discussions and workshops.</p>
<p>And with that, let me now introduce our Deputy Director, Keith Cassidy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith is the Deputy Director of EXAMS and the National Associate Director of the Technology Controls Program.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great advocate for investors, for EXAMS and for the Commission. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith, take it away.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm Senvest Management With Recordkeeping And Other Failures</title>

<div> charged, investment adviser, failure to maintain, violations, $6.5 million penalty
Summary: Senvest Management LLC charged for failure to maintain electronic communications, violating ethics code, and agreed to pay $6.5 million penalty.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against registered investment adviser Senvest Management LLC for widespread and longstanding failures to maintain and preserve certain electronic communications. The SEC also charged Senvest with failing to enforce its code of ethics. To settle this matter, Senvest admitted the facts set forth in the Commission&rsquo;s order, acknowledged that its conduct violated the federal securities laws, and agreed to pay a $6.5 million penalty and to implement improvements to its compliance policies and procedures.</p>
<p>According to the Commission&rsquo;s order, from at least January 2019 through December 2021, Senvest employees at various levels of authority communicated about company business internally and externally using personal texting platforms and other non-Senvest messaging applications in violation of the firm&rsquo;s policies and procedures. Senvest also failed to maintain or preserve the off-channel communications as required under the federal securities laws and the firm's policies and procedures. In one instance, three senior employees engaged in off-channel communications on personal devices that were set to automatically delete messages after 30 days. Additionally, the order finds that certain Senvest employees failed to adhere to provisions of the firm&rsquo;s code of ethics requiring them to obtain pre-clearance for all securities transactions in their personal accounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commission continues to focus on regulated entities&rsquo; compliance with the recordkeeping requirements. Adherence to these requirements is essential for the Commission to effectively exercise its regulatory oversight and enforce the federal securities laws,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office.</p>
<p>The order finds that Senvest violated certain recordkeeping and ethics provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and failed to reasonably supervise with a view to preventing and detecting violations. In addition to the $6.5 million penalty, Senvest was censured and ordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws. The firm also agreed to retain a compliance consultant to, among other things, conduct comprehensive reviews of its policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on personal devices and the framework for addressing non-compliance by its employees with those policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Tom Keltner, Jaime Marinaro, and Jeaneen Kappell of the Fort Worth Regional Office and was supervised by Timothy McCole, B. David Fraser, and Mr. Werner.</p>

<title>Opening Remarks, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, At The Stanford Business, Government, And Society Forum, Stanford Graduate School Of Business, Stanford, California</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a pleasure to be here today. I will begin with the economy and the road ahead for monetary policy before briefly discussing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy independence.</p>
<p>Over the past year, inflation has come down significantly but is still running above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent goal. In February, headline inflation was 2.5 percent over the past 12 months based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. A year earlier, it was 5.2 percent. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, stood at 2.8 percent; a year ago, it was 4.8 percent. While this progress is welcome, the job of sustainably restoring 2 percent inflation is not yet done.</p>
<p>Tight monetary policy continues to weigh on demand, particularly in interest-sensitive spending categories.<span>&nbsp;</span>Nonetheless, growth in economic activity and employment was strong in 2023, as real gross domestic product expanded more than 3 percent and 3 million jobs were created, even as inflation fell substantially. This combination of outcomes reflects significant improvements in supply that offset to some extent the effects on demand of tighter financial conditions. The healing of global supply chains helped address pent-up demand for goods, particularly in sectors that had faced considerable shortages, such as autos. In addition, labor supply increased significantly, thanks to rising participation among 25-to-54-year-olds, as well as a strong pace of immigration.</p>
<p>Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected. The economy added an average of 265,000 jobs per month in the three months through February, a faster pace than we have seen since last June. And the higher inflation data over January and February were above the low readings in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path. Labor market rebalancing is evident in data on quits, job openings, surveys of employers and workers, and the continued gradual decline in wage growth. On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump. We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent. Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy.</p>
<p>We have held our policy rate at its current level since last July. As shown in the individual projections the FOMC released two weeks ago, my colleagues and I continue to believe that the policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as we expect, most FOMC participants see it as likely to be appropriate to begin lowering the policy rate at some point this year.</p>
<p>Of course, the outlook is still quite uncertain, and we face risks on both sides. Reducing rates too soon or too much could result in a reversal of the progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. But easing policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. As progress on inflation continues and labor market tightness eases, these risks continue to move into better balance.</p>
<p>As conditions evolve, monetary policy is well positioned to confront either of these risks. We are making decisions meeting by meeting, and we will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</p>
<p>That brings me to my second topic. The Fed has been assigned two goals for monetary policy&mdash;maximum employment and stable prices. Our success in delivering on these goals matters a great deal to all Americans. To support our pursuit of those goals, Congress granted the Fed a substantial degree of independence in our conduct of monetary policy. Fed policymakers serve long terms that are not synchronized with election cycles. Our decisions are not subject to reversal by other parts of the government, other than through legislation. This independence both enables and requires us to make our monetary policy decisions without consideration of short-term political matters. Such independence for a federal agency is and should be rare. In the case of the Fed, independence is essential to our ability to serve the public. The record shows that independent central banks deliver better economic outcomes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240403a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>We recognize that we need to continually earn this grant of independence, and we do so by carrying out our work with technical competence and objectivity, in a transparent and accountable manner, and by sticking to our knitting.</p>
<p>By technical competence, I mean that Fed policymakers use the most up-to-date information and research to deepen our understanding of the ever-evolving economy and to reliably deliver on our assigned goals. We are supported by a highly capable staff. We also draw on the insights and experiences of a wide array of business, academic, community, and labor leaders, as well as others engaged in the economy. And by objective, I mean that our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public. We will not always get it right&mdash;no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term&mdash;and nothing else.</p>
<p>Transparency and accountability are fundamental for any government agency in a democracy but are especially important for one granted policy independence. The Fed has a special obligation to explain ourselves clearly&mdash;to describe what we are doing and why we are doing it. We are always striving to improve on this communication, and it is a job that is never complete. But we have come a long way. Before 1994, the FOMC did not even announce our monetary policy decisions. Today we announce those decisions and explain the thinking behind them in our post meeting statement and press conference. We publish detailed minutes of our deliberations and a quarterly summary of the economic and policy projections of each FOMC participant. We publish a monetary policy report twice a year, and the Chair appears before Congress to present that report and answer any and all questions that are on the minds of our oversight committee members. In 2020, we completed a yearlong public review of our monetary policy framework, and late this year, we will begin another such review.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240403a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;My colleagues and I explain our views on the economic outlook and monetary policy in speeches like this one, and in visits to communities across the country, as part of extensive outreach in which we seek input from individuals and groups throughout society. Transparency is an affirmative and proactive commitment to the public.</p>
<p>To maintain the public's trust, we also need to avoid "mission creep." Our nation faces many challenges, some of which directly or indirectly involve the economy. Fed policymakers are often pressed to take a position on issues that are arguably relevant to the economy but are not within our mandate, such as particular tax and spending policies, immigration policy, and trade policy. Climate change is another current example. Policies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies that they have charged with this responsibility. The Fed has received no such charge. We do, however, have a narrow role that relates to our responsibilities as a bank supervisor. The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will understand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which, over time, are likely to include climate-related financial risks. We will remain alert to the risk that there will be pressure to expand that role over time. We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers.</p>
<p>In short, doing our job well requires that we respect the limits of our mandate.</p>
<p>Thank you. I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> Director, Small Business, Capital Formation, Resources, SEC
<br />
New Office director emphasizes the importance of the Small Business Advocacy Office, encourages involvement, and highlights educational resources and outreach events.
<br /><br />Summary: Director emphasizes Office's importance, encourages involvement, highlights educational resources and outreach events. <div>
<p>Good morning. Thank you to PLI for hosting this event and to the audience who has tuned in to listen! Because I love music, you will hear that theme woven in throughout my remarks, and to repeat what will be a familiar refrain today, I am speaking in my official capacity as the Director of the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation, and my remarks do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the Commission staff.</p>
<p>I have officially been the Director of the Small Business Advocacy Office for 79 days now&mdash;some might say, too short of a duration to know much of anything; and others might say, long enough to have it all figured out.... At this point, I know two things for sure: one, just like the Grateful Dead sang, &ldquo;the first days are the hardest days&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&mdash;but fortunately the Office&rsquo;s small but mighty team has made them easier; and two, George Jones was onto something when he asked &ldquo;who&rsquo;s gonna fill their shoes?&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, although I have a vision for what I want the Office to achieve, I recognize that I have big shoes to fill as the new leader. Not just those of the inaugural Director, Martha Legg Miller, who stood up this Office in 2019, but also those of the Deputy Director, Sebastian Gomez Abero, who carried the torch upon her departure, and Amy Reischauer, the most recent Acting Deputy Director, who stepped in after Sebastian to keep the Office flourishing.</p>
<p>It is with pride and enthusiasm that I accept the challenge of leading the passionate and dedicated staff of the Office, who worked tirelessly through these leadership changes and have been there to guide and assist me during my first 79 days. They welcomed me with open arms and helped make my transition from academia and private practice in Colorado to this new role as Smooth as Santana and Rob Thomas circa 1999.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; They made it easy to get through my first public-facing test on our 2023 Capital Call&mdash;a virtual event with live questions from the public&mdash;just two weeks into my tenure; they made sure things went off without a hitch on our &ldquo;Incubate, Accelerate, Ignite&rdquo; event seven days later; all while keeping this speech off my radar for at least a few weeks. And to them, I say thanks.</p>
<h3>Our Office is a Bridge</h3>
<p><br />I see this Office as similar to a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; in music&mdash;a connection between two sections of a song; bringing the pieces together. Our Office is here to offer a bridge between the small business community and the agency, a crucial link to help the SEC fulfil its three-prong mission. Because a bridge&rsquo;s essential function is to connect, under my leadership, this Office will continue to listen to and support small businesses and their investors seeking to engage in capital formation, and to amplify their voices inside the agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we are not just a one-way bridge. We recognize that listening is not enough; we also love sharing what we learn. Unlike Rod Stewart, we do want to talk about it!<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In fact, we like talking about it so much that we publish an annual report on the state of capital formation. For those who haven&rsquo;t seen our report, it is full of enlightening data and colorful graphics. For instance, did you know that one in five adults is currently founding or has founded a business in the past three-and-a-half years?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;What about the fact that 63% of net new jobs are created by small businesses or that 44% of US GDP is created by those same businesses?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;And were you aware that more than half of small businesses are only seeking $50,000 in capital to get started?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Those are pretty impressive and informative statistics. It turns out that, as is often the case, conventional wisdom is right: small businesses really are the backbone of America.</p>
<p>If it hasn&rsquo;t dawned on you yet, I&rsquo;m so nerdy that the Barenaked Ladies could have written their Big Bang Theory theme song about me and my love of numbers&mdash;okay, maybe not that nerdy&mdash;but you get my point.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;I love data because it tells a story and often an interesting one. So, if you appreciate numbers like the staff in our Office and I do, and if you&rsquo;re looking for good stories, I encourage you to take some time and peruse our 2023 Annual Report. I promise you it is a surprisingly interesting read, and the graphics may make you question if it is really a government report!</p>
<h3>Help!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></h3>
<p><br />As you listen to me yammer on about statistics, you may be wondering why you should care. You should care because, much like the Beatles circa 1965, these small businesses need Help! They need access to resources, connections, advice, and mentorship to help them get off the ground, keep their doors open, and succeed. Our Office publishes and maintains a suite of educational resources on our Capital Raising Hub at sec.gov/capitalraising to help these entrepreneurs and their investors break down the complexity of the securities laws and cut through the jargon. Our resources are also designed to help incubators, accelerators, and other organizations that support and mentor them. And because so many startups tell us how difficult it is to find support, resources, and role models, helping them find those much-desired connections will be a priority of my directorship.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>This is where you can play a part! In the words of Patti Smith, &ldquo;People Have the Power.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;After all, facilitating capital formation is a prong of the SEC&rsquo;s mission in which most everyone can truly play a role. &nbsp;For those asking, &ldquo;how can I help respond to the calls from small businesses saying, &lsquo;won&rsquo;t you please, please help me?&rsquo;&rdquo;, perhaps you could consider volunteering with organizations that assist small businesses, exploring mentorship opportunities through entrepreneurial centers or other support organizations, or steering a small business owner or investor to our Office&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<h3>Shout, Shout, Let it All Out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></h3>
<p><br />While you ponder how you might get involved, we will continue to do our part as we &ldquo;shout, shout, let it all out!&rdquo;&mdash;to quote Tears for Fears. And you know what makes us want to shout? Our Office&rsquo;s resources because they are tools that small businesses should not do without. If you&rsquo;re a small business owner or investor looking for guidance about how your world might intersect with the securities laws, take the bridge over to our Capital Raising Hub at sec.gov/capitalraising! While founders may not love every answer they get on the Hub, we are big fans of the Rolling Stones in this Office, and it is our duty to remind them that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, well you just might find, you get what you need.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>And what you need might be in our Building Blocks, a series of one-pagers breaking down fundamental securities law concepts into plain language; or perhaps in our grammy award worthy &ldquo;Cutting through the Jargon&rdquo; glossary, which makes capital-raising terminology as accessible as a Taylor Swift song.</p>
<p>Or maybe you don&rsquo;t really know much about capital-raising rules and what on earth the SEC has to do with your small business. In that case, you may want to start out with our navigator&mdash;it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;choose your adventure&rdquo; type of tool that will point you to one or more of our user-friendly resources based on where you are in your capital-raising journey.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re a lawyer, and your cost-sensitive client is requesting information about a new rule. While all of us in this room may be willing to wade through a 400-page release&mdash;hey, let&rsquo;s be honest that is just a little light reading, right?&mdash;your client may think you have lost your mind if you suggest they read the latest SEC rule-making proposal to understand their legal obligations. Don&rsquo;t worry! We all know &ldquo;Video Killed the Radio Star,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;so you can send them over to our Office&rsquo;s Rulemaking Video Gallery, where we publish short videos summarizing how proposed and adopted rules affect small businesses, and we promise we won&rsquo;t Rickroll them (or will we?).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Of course, this is no substitute for a lawyer&rsquo;s sage legal advice, but the videos are a trustworthy source of background information&mdash;certainly much better than pulling a Marvin Gaye and hearing it through the grapevine!<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<h3>Rikki Don&rsquo;t Lose that Number&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></h3>
<p><br />Hopefully, this speech will prompt you to dive into our Annual Report to explore how we bring data to life and amplify the stories of small business capital formation. Or prompt you to check out our Capital Raising Hub if you are looking for educational resources. I suspect you will become a frequent user of both, like I was before I joined the Office and, of course, still am. And if a little voice inside of you tells you that you want to help us improve them, please heed the advice of Steely Dan, who said &ldquo;Rikki Don&rsquo;t Lose that Number,&rdquo; or in this case, don&rsquo;t lose our website and email addresses because we really do want to hear your ideas! We are always working on expanding our resources to bring additional information based on user feedback. Next up in the playlist will be how to decipher financial statements and ways to seek out that much needed mentorship. We truly welcome suggestions on further additions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And beyond our educational resources, we always want to hear your thoughts on specific statutes or rules&mdash;existing or proposed&mdash;and how they affect small businesses and their investors. In addition to submitting comments on proposed rules through the Commission&rsquo;s comment portal, you may also share your thoughts and insights with us via&nbsp;<a href="mailto:smallbusiness@sec.gov">smallbusiness@sec.gov</a>&mdash;that email address you shouldn&rsquo;t lose.</p>
<h3>Closing Time, Open All the Doors and Let You Out Into the World (of Capital Raising)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/bowers-sec-speaks-04032024#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></h3>
<p><br />While I have only had the privilege of being a part of this Office for 79 days, I am proud of what the team accomplishes on a daily basis. In addition to our Annual Report and educational resources, we review every SEC rulemaking to look at the impact it may have on small businesses and their investors. We also do dozens of outreach events throughout the year to engage with the small business community. Just around the corner, on April 16-18, we will host the SEC&rsquo;s Small Business Forum! Don&rsquo;t forget to register.</p>
<p>I look forward to this Office continuing to be a strong advocate for the small business community, and I will do my best to improve the access that small businesses and investors have to the mentorship, guidance, and resources that they need to succeed. And remember, don&rsquo;t lose our contact information because you can always reach out to us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:smallbusiness@sec.gov">smallbusiness@sec.gov</a>&nbsp;with your questions or ideas and visit our resources on our Capital Raising Hub at sec.gov/capitalraising.</p>
<p>And now, to bring this speech to an end, it is time for the mandatory late 90s throwback. While it&rsquo;s &ldquo;closing time&rdquo; for me, all of you get to stay here and enjoy the rest of this wonderful conference! Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Enforcement Division, FY 2023, recordkeeping, penalties <br />
Summary: SEC Enforcement Division FY 2023 highlights recordkeeping violations, penalties, and factors considered for individualized assessments in enforcement initiatives. <div>
<p>Thank you, Gurbir.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to begin with the disclaimer that my remarks today are in my official capacity as Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>I want to echo Gurbir by thanking PLI for providing free access to the online stream of this program. It is important that those who are interested in the work of the SEC have an opportunity to hear from us. In the spirit of addressing a wider audience, we have deliberately tried to include practical tips and best practices in this panel discussion and in the Enforcement workshop later this afternoon.</p>
<p>Before I introduce the panel, I want to briefly highlight some of the Division&rsquo;s work during the last fiscal year (FY).</p>
<ul>
<li>In FY 2023, the Commission filed 784 total ENF actions, representing a 3% increase over the prior FY.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/sanjay-wadhwa-sec-speaks-2024-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These included 501 original, or &ldquo;stand-alone,&rdquo; ENF actions, which was an 8% increase over the prior FY.</li>
<li>In addition, we filed 162 "follow-on" administrative proceedings seeking to bar or suspend individuals from certain functions in the securities markets based on criminal convictions, civil injunctions, or other orders; and we filed 121 actions against issuers who were allegedly delinquent in making required SEC filings.</li>
<li>The SEC obtained orders for just under $5 billion in financial remedies, the second highest amount in SEC history after the record-setting financial remedies ordered in fiscal 2022. The financial remedies comprised nearly $3.37 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and nearly $1.6 billion in civil penalties.</li>
<li>In addition, the SEC obtained orders barring 133 individuals from serving as officers and directors of public companies, the highest number of officer and director bars obtained in a decade.</li>
<li>FY 2023 was also a record-breaking year for the Whistleblower Program. The SEC issued whistleblower awards totaling nearly $600 million, the most ever awarded in one year, including a record-breaking $279 million awarded to one whistleblower.</li>
<li>Reflecting the success of that program, we received more than 18,000 whistleblower tips in FY 2023, the most ever, and roughly 50% more than the prior record set in FY 2022.</li>
<li>Finally, we distributed $930 million to harmed investors, marking the second consecutive year with more than $900 million in distributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, these numbers don&rsquo;t tell the full story of the important work we did in FY 2023, or of the work we are engaged in now. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to cover that over these two days, much less in the hour we have for this panel.</p>
<p>But I am going to briefly address two ongoing Enforcement initiatives that have received a fair amount of attention: the recordkeeping initiative and the amended marketing rule initiative. Specifically, I&rsquo;ll address our approach to penalties in these matters.</p>
<p>Since December 2021, the Commission has charged nearly 60 firms &ndash; investment advisers, broker-dealers, and credit ratings agencies &ndash; with recordkeeping violations, resulting in combined penalties of just over $1.7 billion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/sanjay-wadhwa-sec-speaks-2024-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;This initiative has received a great deal of attention, much of it focused on penalties, which were as high as $125 million for some of the firms, while, on the lower end of the spectrum, one firm paid a $2.5 million penalty.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a result of that wide range in penalties, there has been a critique from the defense bar that we&rsquo;re picking numbers at random; that they&rsquo;re not informed by individualized determinations. I&rsquo;m here to disabuse you all of that perception: stated simply, we do make an individualized assessment of each firm. I&rsquo;ll share some of the factors we focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>We consider the size of the firm to ensure that the penalties are adequate to serve as a deterrent against future violations. A penalty that may be adequate with one firm may not be adequate with another. That means we look at the firm&rsquo;s revenues from the regulated parts of its business. We also look at the number of registered professionals at the firm.</li>
<li>We consider the scope of the violations. How many individuals communicated off-channel? How many off-channel communications were there? But since we&rsquo;re generally dealing with samples, not with the total numbers, there is not a strict correlation between these numbers and the penalty.&nbsp;Consideration of other factors may also result in a relatively larger or smaller recommended penalty.</li>
<li>We take into consideration a firm&rsquo;s efforts to comply with its recordkeeping obligations and to prevent off-channel communications, focusing, for example, on timely adoption of meaningful technological or other solutions.</li>
<li>We consider precedent. The SEC has now issued 40 settled orders in these matters since December 2021. These precedents are a guide but are not determinative. They are part of an individualized determination; not a substitute for it.</li>
<li>We also consider whether a firm self-reported.&nbsp;This is, in fact, the most significant factor in terms of moving the needle on penalties.&nbsp;From our prior actions, you can see how much we have credited those firms which have chosen to self-report, including the $2.5 million penalty I mentioned.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/sanjay-wadhwa-sec-speaks-2024-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></li>
<li>Finally, we consider cooperation.&nbsp;Firms that do not self-report can still receive credit based on their cooperation with ENF staff during our investigation. We&rsquo;ll address what cooperation looks like during the panel discussion to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some of the factors we consider when assessing what penalty to recommend in each action. While none of these is dispositive, I want to reiterate that self-reporting is the factor most likely to significantly lower the penalty we recommend.</p>
<p>Our initiative to enforce compliance with the amended marketing rule involved penalties ranging from $175,000 to $50,000.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/sanjay-wadhwa-sec-speaks-2024-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>This initiative, too, has made a big impact on the industry. Which is what we intended, as the amended rule contains important investor protection measures that we want to ensure that firms comply with.</p>
<p>Here, too, we conduct an individualized assessment of each firm when determining what penalty to recommend. The factors we look at include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A firm&rsquo;s reported regulatory assets under management;</li>
<li>The nature of the regulatory history of the firm, including the nature of any prior enforcement actions;</li>
<li>Whether the firm promptly remediated the noncompliant marketing materials;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The need to send strong messages of accountability and deterrence; and</li>
<li>As with the recordkeeping cases and, frankly, all our cases, we consider whether a firm self-reported and cooperated with our investigation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope those factors I have laid out are helpful in the event that your firm or your client is confronting these issues. In fact, those factors are almost certainly going to be relevant in any SEC investigation you may be dealing with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll turn now to my colleagues here for their presentations, which will include recent judicial developments in our space and helpful practice tips.</p>

<title>The Bank Of England And The UK Financial Conduct Authority Issue Joint Consultation And Draft Guidance On The Digital Securities Sandbox</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-and-the-uk-financial-conduct-authority-issue-joint-consultat/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-and-the-uk-financial-conduct-authority-issue-joint-consultat/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of England (the Bank) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (collectively the &lsquo;regulators&rsquo;) are consulting on their proposed approach to operating the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS). The DSS is an initiative run by the regulators that will help facilitate the adoption of innovative technology in digital assets in the UK.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DSS will modify regulations in the UK to enable financial market participants to use new technology &ndash; such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) &ndash; in the trading and settlement of digital securities such as shares and bonds. Successful applicants to the DSS will be able to provide securities depository and settlement services and operate a trading venue under those modified regulations. For the first time, they will be able to provide these services from a single legal entity. The DSS will be open to a wide range of firms, including new financial markets infrastructure (FMI) providers, to maximise the opportunities to learn and for the UK financial system to benefit from private sector innovation and competing business models.</p>
<p>The DSS represents a major step in exploring innovation in digital assets in the UK and could lead to faster and cheaper ways for these securities to trade, settle, and be utilised among financial market participants. The adoption of new technology in this area, if done safely, could lead to a technological transformation that will promote greater efficiency as well as greater resilience in the financial system in the long run. Alongside the work that the Bank is doing to explore and develop innovation in wholesale payments, including as part of enhancing the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) services, the DSS places the UK in a strong position to create an end-to-end digital wholesale infrastructure that embraces new technology.</p>
<p>The DSS will last five years and may lead to a new permanent regulatory regime for securities settlement under which firms could operate in future. The Government has the tools to put in place permanent changes reasonably quickly. In order to protect financial stability, activity in the DSS over this period will be subject to limits.</p>
<p>The consultation invites views from interested participants on how the DSS will operate in practice, in order to maximise the potential benefits from the technology while protecting financial stability and market integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Mills, Executive Director for Financial Market Infrastructure at the Bank said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Digital Securities Sandbox is an important tool for regulators to learn how we need to react to benefit safely from developments in technology and changes to vital financial market processes such as securities settlement. This consultation is an innovative approach for regulators and an exciting milestone in supporting innovation in the financial industry. We welcome views from potential participants and look forward to working with the FCA, government and industry over the lifespan of the DSS.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director, Consumers and Competition at the FCA said:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The new Digital Securities Sandbox reshapes how we regulate by allowing firms to test regulatory changes using real world situations before these changes are made permanent. We hope this will be a more effective, collaborative and quicker way of delivering regulatory change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new sandbox also helps strengthen the UK&rsquo;s leading position as a global and vibrant financial centre, by driving adoption of new technologies for trading and settling traditional assets, like bonds and equities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to work with the Bank of England, government and industry to harness new technologies while also protecting the integrity and cleanliness of UK markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside the consultation paper, regulators have published:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft guidance for firms looking to enter the DSS, including details of how the Bank proposes to allow firms to scale their activities once authorised to undertake live activity in the DSS. This approach is consistent with the Bank&rsquo;s commitment to the key objective of maintaining financial stability.</li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of how existing regulations related to securities depositories will be transposed into &lsquo;Rules&rsquo; at different stages of the DSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feedback on the consultation is open until 29 May 2024. Subject to feedback, the regulators propose to publish final guidance for firms and open the DSS for applications in Summer 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>The proposals in this consultation paper follow Parliament&rsquo;s adoption of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/29/contents/enacted" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Financial Services and Markets Act 2023<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, which gave HM Treasury the power to legislate to create Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) Sandboxes to be operated by regulators. HM Treasury&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-the-digital-securities-sandbox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consulted on the DSS in July 2023<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, and laid the relevant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1398/contents/made" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Statutory Instrument (SI) creating the DSS in December 2023<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>.</li>
<li>The predominant existing legislation being tested is the UK Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR). This is amended via the DSS Statutory Instrument and through transposing of firm-facing requirements into rules. These rules will be applied to firms through Bank supervision in proportion to the amount of live activity an authorised firm is permitted to undertake.</li>
<li>Firms seeking to operate securities settlement systems (and/or other activities currently carried out by Central Securities Depositories (CSDs)) will be authorised by the Bank as Digital Securities Depositories (DSDs). This includes the maintenance and issuance of securities recorded on DLT.</li>
<li>The DSS will support multiple asset classes, including equities, corporate and government bonds, asset-backed securities, units in collective investment schemes,<br />short-term money market instruments such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit, and emissions allowances. Derivative contracts that require settlement on a settlement system, and unbacked cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, are not in scope for the DSS. The DSS will support both digitally native issued securities and digital (tokenised) representation of existing securities.</li>
<li>The DSS will be open for applications to firms that are UK registered and able to identify regulatory barriers that prevent the proposed activity being carried out under existing regulations.</li>
<li>The Bank is continuously developing wholesale payments.

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange Q1: Record Quarter For Bond Listings In A Continuously Challenging Environment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-q1-record-quarter-for-bond-listings-in-a-continuously-cha/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-q1-record-quarter-for-bond-listings-in-a-continuously-cha/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>High interest rates, the ongoing war in Ukraine and persistently high inflation: trading activity on the Vienna Stock Exchange in the first quarter of 2024 &ndash; as on comparable European markets &ndash; was characterised by the unchanged difficult conditions. Share turnover totalled EUR 14.3 billion in the first three months. Bond listings, on the other hand, remained at a record level, with 3,000 new listings, the best start to a year in historical terms. Securities ownership in Austria is also developing positively, as the latest &ldquo;Aktienbarometer&rdquo; shows. With Jump Trading B.V., a new trading member was connected to the Vienna Stock Exchange. This means that a total of 69 members &ndash; 21 Austrian and 48 international banks and investment firms &ndash; are currently authorised to trade on the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-q12024.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Vienna Stock Exchange Q1 2024" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/d/b/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-q12024_5a5b1440eb.jpg" title="Trading and listings on the Vienna Stock Exchange 2024" width="514" /></a></p>
<p>"Trading volumes declined across the EU, with the exception of Italy and Germany. As an exchange company our successful business diversification enables us to compensate for subdued trading activity", explains Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange and adds: "Austria remains a highly interesting market with its attractive dividend yields of 6% on average and a very moderate valuation."</p>
<p>Share turnover totalling EUR 14.3 billion was recorded for the first quarter. The three strongest trading days year-to-date were 15 March (EUR 812.8 million), 29 February (EUR 517.8 million) and 31 January (EUR 342 million). The shares with the highest turnover as of 28 March were Erste Group Bank AG (EUR 2.44 billion), OMV AG (EUR 1.97 billion) and Verbund AG (EUR 1.41 billion).</p>
<h2>Increasing securities ownership in Austria</h2>
<p>Austrian shares are certainly very popular among domestic security holders, as the Aktienbarometer 2024 &ndash; a study by Aktienforum, the Federation of Austrian Industries and the Vienna Stock Exchange &ndash; shows. Almost three quarters (72%) of people who invest in securities also hold stocks in Austrian companies. In general, the current Aktienbarometer shows a positive trend: According to it, more than one in four people (27%) in Austria already invest in stocks, bonds or investment funds and ETFs. The number of Austrian investors has thus risen by two percentage points or 200,000 people compared to the previous year. The study also emphasises the key role of education: a higher level of education correlates strongly with the ownership of securities. Conversely, the perceived lack of sound financial knowledge is the main reason for not investing in securities.</p>
<p>"The positive trend in securities ownership is even more remarkable given the unfavourable economic environment and missing incentives for private pension provision, for example through capital gains tax. Policymakers are lagging behind the growing public need for private pension provision and the reintroduction of a retention period for securities is long overdue. The study also highlights the continuing need for comprehensive financial education. Greater capital market integration of the population is not only important for individual wealth accumulation, but also strengthens our economy and promotes the growth of innovative companies," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>Bonds: Record year followed by historically best first quarter</h2>
<p>Growth in the bond segment remains strong. After the Vienna Stock Exchange recorded more new listings than ever before in 2023, the first quarter seamlessly followed on from the record year. More than 3,000 new listings on the exchange-regulated Vienna MTF in the first three months represent an all-time high. The Vienna Stock Exchange serves a total of 900 active bond issuers from 37 countries. The first quarter also brought a significant change for Austrian government bonds. These have been tradable all day on the Vienna Stock Exchange since the beginning of March. As market makers, Erste Group Bank AG and Raiffeisen Bank International AG ensure continuous liquidity and high price quality, which benefits private investors in particular.</p>
<h2>Sideways movement in the national index</h2>
<p>After the ATX TR gained 15.44% in the past year (ATX excluding dividends: 9.87%), the market moved sideways in the first quarter. Year-to-date, the ATX TR rose by 3.35% and stood at 7,871.14 points on 28 March (ATX: 2.94%, 3,535.79 points). The comparatively high inflation in Austria and ongoing uncertainties due to the war in Ukraine are putting disproportionate pressure on Austria's leading companies with their strong CEE network and therefore on the ATX. In addition, ATX stocks are currently valued at historically low levels with a price/earnings ratio of around 7.5. The traditionally high dividend yields remain unaffected by the current situation: The forecast average dividend yield in the ATX for 2024 is around 6%. Following share price gains, S IMMO AG (40.96%), Addiko Bank AG (34.46%) and BAWAG Group AG (22.34%) were the top performers in the ATX Prime since the beginning of the year up to 28 March. The market capitalisation of all companies listed in Vienna amounted to EUR 127.5 billion at this time.</p>

<div> tokenisation, wholesale central bank money, smart contracts, international payments, Project Agorá<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Project Agorá aims to explore tokenisation and smart contracts to improve the monetary system, especially in international payments, through a public-private partnership. <div>
<p><img src="https://www.bis.org/img/banners/bisih_agora.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Project Agor&aacute; will explore how tokenisation of wholesale central bank money and commercial bank deposits on programmable platforms can improve the monetary system.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The project will explore how tokenisation and smart contracts could enable functionalities and transactions that are not viable today.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The primary area of exploration will be to increase the speed and integrity of international payments, while lowering costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) together with seven central banks today announced plans to join forces with the private sector to explore how tokenisation can enhance the functioning of the monetary system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/agora.htm"><span class="firstword">Project</span>&nbsp;Agor&aacute;</a>&nbsp;(Greek for "marketplace") brings together seven central banks: Bank of France (representing the Eurosystem), Bank of Japan, Bank of Korea, Bank of Mexico, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. They will seek to work in partnership with a large group of private financial firms convened by the&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.iif.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">Institute</span>&nbsp;of International Finance</a>&nbsp;(IIF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project builds on the unified ledger concept&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2023e3.htm"><span class="firstword">proposed</span>&nbsp;by the BIS</a>&nbsp;and will investigate how tokenised commercial bank deposits can be seamlessly integrated with tokenised wholesale central bank money in a public-private programmable core financial platform. This could enhance the functioning of the monetary system and provide new solutions using smart contracts and programmability, while maintaining&nbsp;its two-tier structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart contracts can enable new ways of settlement and unlock types of transactions that are not viable or practical today, in turn offering new opportunities to benefit businesses and people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This major public-private partnership will seek to overcome several structural inefficiencies in how payments happen today, especially across borders, which add a layer of challenges: different legal, regulatory and technical requirements, operating hours and time zones. Plus the increased complexity of carrying out financial integrity controls (eg against money laundering and customer verification), which today are often repeated several times for the same transaction, depending on the number of intermediaries involved.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Today, numerous payment systems, accounting ledgers and data registries require other complex systems to integrate them. In Project Agor&aacute;, we want to explore a new common payment infrastructure that could bring all these elements together and might make the system work more efficiently together on a digital core financial infrastructure. We will not just test the technology, we will test it within the specific operational, regulatory and legal conditions of the participating currencies, together with financial companies operating in them.</span></p>

<p><span>Tokenisation combines the record-keeping function of a traditional database with the rules and logic that govern transfers. With Project Agor&aacute;, we aim to improve existing capabilities and enable new ones, all based on the proven foundations of the two-tier monetary system with central banks at the core. These functionalities will come without sacrificing the safeguards on the integrity and governance of the monetary system.</span></p>

<p>BIS Innovation Hub projects are generally experimental in nature and aim to explore and deliver public goods to the global central banking community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>The BIS will issue a call for expressions of interest to private financial institutions to join Project Agor&aacute;. The IIF will act as the intermediary and convener of private sector participants. It is envisaged that several regulated financial institutions will participate representing each of the seven currencies. Specific instructions and requirements will be issued in due course. Being a member of the IIF is not a requirement to participate.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, crypto enforcement, regulations, investor protection, Division of Enforcement
Summary:
The SEC's Division of Enforcement addresses the challenges of regulating crypto markets, including protecting investors and addressing noncompliance and fraudulent practices. <div>
<p>Good morning everyone, and welcome!</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re here in person or participating virtually from around the country, or even overseas, I thank you for joining us.</p>
<p>As is customary, my remarks this morning are in my official capacity as Director of the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>I want to start by thanking PLI for organizing this event and making it available for free to all this year. It is important for us to speak directly to not just the securities bar, but also to everyone that is interested in our work.</p>
<p>And that is precisely what we&rsquo;d like to do today&mdash;speak to you directly. In a few moments, my Enforcement Division colleagues will talk to you about the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of our work &mdash; in other words, the issues that are top of mind for us.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s explaining how we&rsquo;re thinking about penalties, disgorgement and remedies; highlighting enforcement initiatives; discussing legal developments; or outlining the many ways in which we are encouraging and rewarding cooperation; this type of dialogue benefits all of us.</p>
<p>By hearing about issues significant to the Enforcement program, you all are better able to counsel your clients. And, together, we are better able to protect investors &ndash; which, after all, should be our shared mission.</p>
<p>But before we get to the &ldquo;what,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d like to discuss the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of our work.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that we are facing significant headwinds in our enforcement efforts. There are some that question our authority, hoping for a different regulatory regime altogether for their industry. And there are others that question our motivations. And in rare cases, there are also those that question the integrity with which we approach our work. I&rsquo;d like to address each of these headwinds, in turn, underscoring the importance of our work in the process.</p>
<p>In the decade since we brought our first crypto enforcement actions, our approach has been consistent, principled, and tethered to the federal securities laws and legal precedent. After all, every lawyer here knows what the test is to determine whether a crypto asset was offered and sold as an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and therefore a security: it&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<em>Howey&nbsp;</em>test.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;essential ingredients&rdquo; test,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;or the Beanie Baby test,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;or some other test that industry folks might like to create for themselves.</p>
<p>And for years, the SEC has clearly and consistently applied&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;and its progeny to protect investors in the crypto space. We have applied it to the alleged facts in dozens of orders, complaints, and briefs. These are not secret analyses; they are public documents for the whole world to see.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Even parties that argue in court that their conduct does not implicate the federal securities laws have themselves used the&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;framework internally for years to evaluate crypto offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all crypto products are offered as &ldquo;investment contracts&rdquo; and are therefore securities. But it does mean that the analytical framework&mdash;the test&mdash;for whether something is an &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; is the same whether we&rsquo;re dealing with transactions involving crypto products or with transactions involving the many other kinds of offerings that courts have analyzed under&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, over the past decade, we have confronted significant non-compliance and many, many creative attempts by market participants to avoid our jurisdiction, with some claiming that we are making it up as we go or regulating by enforcement, and others arguing that we are recklessly exceeding our authorities.</p>
<p>They have variously argued that their crypto products were &ldquo;currencies&rdquo; and, therefore, beyond our remit; that the term &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; was unconstitutionally vague and could not be applied to crypto; that their offerings were &ldquo;utility tokens&rdquo; not securities; that there was a &ldquo;lack of fair notice&rdquo; their conduct implicated the securities laws; that everything was &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; and because there were no entities or entrepreneurs involved, we lacked jurisdiction; that there needed to be an actual &ldquo;contract&rdquo; for there to be an &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; under&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>; and more recently that there was something called the &ldquo;major questions doctrine&rdquo; that prevented us from using our tools to protect investors in the crypto markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&rsquo;ve been accused of picking winners and losers, stifling innovation, and driving crypto businesses to more favorable, foreign jurisdictions, wherever they may be.</p>
<p>A decade&rsquo;s worth of verbal gymnastics that are just a backhanded way of saying, &ldquo;we want a different set of rules than those that apply to everyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A decade&rsquo;s worth of arguments that have served as nothing more than a distraction from the very real issues and risks that the crypto markets present for the investing public.</p>
<p>And most importantly, a decade&rsquo;s worth of arguments that have been serially rejected in one way or another by court after court.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;As we have consistently maintained, and as court after court has confirmed, the federal securities laws apply equally to everyone. You don&rsquo;t get your own rules.</p>
<p>Indeed, as one federal court recently stated, &ldquo;the &lsquo;crypto&rsquo; nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The court went on to observe that &ldquo;[u]sing enforcement actions to address crypto-assets is simply the latest chapter in a long history of giving meaning to the securities laws through iterative application to new situations.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>These crypto enforcement actions have not been, and are not, without challenge. Given the stakes and the resources available to our adversaries, they have been among the most hard fought that I&rsquo;ve seen in my career. But I am incredibly proud of the perseverance of the staff, who push forward for one reason alone: because investor protection demands it.</p>
<p>Last year, the Pew Research Center released a survey finding that nearly a third of Americans who had ever invested in, traded, or used crypto, no longer held any.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The same survey found that a whopping three-quarters of Americans who have heard about crypto do not believe that it is reliable and safe.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Given the continued noncompliance in this space, they have good reason to be concerned.</p>
<p>One need look no further than last week&rsquo;s sentencing of Samuel Bankman-Fried to see the impact of noncompliance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;In advance of the sentencing, the Department of Justice filed hundreds of victim statements with the court.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The victim statements reflect the incredibly broad cross-section of people who were harmed by the fraud that Bankman-Fried was convicted of: single parents, retirees, young people, grandparents. People who were forced to sell their home, their car, or take on a second job to make up for their losses. People who had to figure out a way to pay for their mortgage, education, retirement, and so on.</p>
<p>And as another example, just last month, the SEC charged 17 individuals for their role in an alleged crypto Ponzi scheme that raised $300 million from more than&nbsp;<em>40,000</em>&nbsp;investors, primarily from the Latino community.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Several defendants allegedly solicited investors with promises of financial freedom and &ldquo;risk free&rdquo; crypto and foreign exchange investments.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;As alleged in our complaint, in true Ponzi fashion, most of the funds raised were not used for any investments; they were instead used to fund the defendants&rsquo; lifestyles and to pay supposed returns to other investors.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;predatory inclusion&rdquo; tactics that certain crypto entities are directing at Black, brown, and other marginalized communities are extremely troubling.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Here, I&rsquo;m talking about the familiar (but so far unsupported) narratives that crypto will increase financial inclusion;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;that it will uplift the unbanked or underbanked; and that it will help them build wealth and increase upward mobility.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen unlawful tactics on full display in cases where the SEC has charged &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; for touting unregistered crypto asset offerings to investors without disclosing that they are being compensated to do so.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;We even charged one celebrity with making materially false and misleading tweets about supposed returns from his crypto investments while not disclosing that he was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for his tweets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the direct result of these types of efforts or for other reasons beyond the scope of these remarks, crypto assets are the only major financial products that Black Americans are more likely to own than white Americans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;And there is some evidence that Black and brown investors were disproportionately harmed during the downturn of crypto markets over the last few years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In the end, the stories of the victims in all of these cases are absolutely devastating and they are our &ldquo;why.&rdquo; But somehow they are constantly drowned out by tired industry talking points about us exceeding our authorities and destroying innovation, among others. But regardless of the headwinds, we remain committed to using all the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, including against risks in the crypto markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my hope that, after the latest in a long and growing string of courts affirming our authority to police the crypto markets, we can move past them and address the very real issues present in this industry that lead to elevated investor risk: fraud, lack of transparency, commingling of assets, conflicts of interest, and lack of oversight, to mention just a few.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to end by addressing a particular headwind that we face&nbsp;from certain market participants: attacks on our integrity. I am now coming up on three years in this role, and like so many of my colleagues I have spent the majority of my career in public service. During that time, I have had the privilege to work alongside thousands upon thousands of dedicated public servants at the local, state and federal levels. And here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned: we don&rsquo;t do this work to round corners and notch wins. Nor do we do it for financial incentives or personal gain. The overwhelming majority of us do it for one reason alone: we believe in standing up for others. In the case of the Enforcement Division, that means standing up each and every day for the investing public.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, as we speak, there are investigative teams across the division poring through voluminous records to, for example, seek emergency relief to stop ongoing frauds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a trial team in New York walking into district court, as we speak, to present evidence to a jury concerning a massive alleged crypto fraud&mdash;all in an effort to hold accountable the individual and entity responsible for alleged widespread investor harm.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a></p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why in just a few hours, a trial team in California will walk into district court to hold accountable an insider that allegedly benefitted from his position in a way the rest of us cannot&mdash;by engaging in, as we allege, insider trading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Our ability to do all of this work depends on trust and credibility. As I&rsquo;ve spoken about previously, the public must have confidence that we will hold bad actors accountable when they violate the securities laws regardless of who, or how powerful, they are. And the public, courts and the bar must all have confidence in the representations we make when we are advocating to protect investors.</p>
<p>We can never let our zeal to address misconduct compromise that reservoir of trust and credibility that we, and the other public servants that came before us, have spent careers building and protecting; after all, it&rsquo;s what allows us to do so much of the good we are trying to do.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a></p>
<p>That also means if we fall short, we must acknowledge our mistakes and recommit ourselves to doing everything we can to never compromise that reservoir, as we recently have.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>But what we will not do is let any criticism that we may face overshadow the incredible work being done by the Enforcement Division on a daily basis on behalf of the investing public. Instead, we will embrace any scrutiny we face to highlight it.</p>
<p>With that, I&rsquo;ll turn it over to Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the Division Enforcement, for some brief remarks and to introduce the Enforcement panel, which will discuss some of our investor protection efforts.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to speaking with you throughout the day.</p>

<div> Banking system stress, Federal Reserve liquidity role, discount window, regulatory framework, lender of last resort
<br />
Summary: The article discusses the Federal Reserve's role in providing liquidity to the banking system, the challenges it faces, and the need for optimization and enhancements to its tools and operations. <div>
<p>Today's roundtable comes at an opportune time, as we recently passed the one-year anniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The long shadow of these bank failures, and the subsequent failure of First Republic, have prompted a great deal of discussion about the bank regulatory framework, including capital regulation, the approach to supervision, and the role of tailoring, among other topics. It is my hope that our discussion today reviews and considers the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve in providing liquidity to the U.S. banking system and, of course, its role as the "lender of last resort" through the discount window and authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.</p>
<p>I look forward to today's panels and a deeper examination of important policy questions, including the lessons that should be learned from the banking system stress experienced last spring, the broader stress in financial markets during the COVID-19 crisis, potential approaches to operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to more effectively meet industry liquidity needs, and the importance of effective resolution mechanisms in the banking system.</p>
<p>Before the panels get into a "deep dive" on these policy issues, I would like to briefly touch on three main themes: (1) the broader framework in which the Federal Reserve supports liquidity in the banking system, particularly how this function complements other regulatory requirements and sources of liquidity; (2) how this function can be optimized to work within the evolving liquidity framework; and (3) the challenges we face in making the Federal Reserve's liquidity tools, particularly the discount window, effective.</p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve's Role in Banking System Liquidity</strong><br />The complexity of the U.S. financial system makes it difficult to predict where the next stress (or in the worst case, the next crisis) will arise. While today's event will focus on recent episodes that required the Federal Reserve to employ its liquidity tools&mdash;the COVID crisis and the early 2023 banking stress&mdash;it is helpful to consider how the Federal Reserve's authority has evolved in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Let's review the historical context, which could be helpful for framing the discussion. In 1913, Congress established the Federal Reserve at least in part to help address the pattern of cyclical financial panics and the ensuing economic turmoil that followed by allowing the Fed to create a more elastic money supply to meet demand for liquidity during times of stress. This authority included tools like open market operations, later used as a tool for monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Since its establishment, the Federal Reserve was granted the authority to engage in discount window lending.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;In addition, during the Great Depression, the Fed was given a broader set of tools to engage in emergency lending under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>More recently, in 2003, the Federal Reserve restructured its previous discount window lending programs and established the Primary Credit Facility (PCF) and Secondary Credit Facility.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Primary credit enabled financially strong banks to obtain secured loans from the discount window at a penalty rate. The secondary credit provided discount window loans at a higher rate, and with higher collateral haircuts and other more stringent terms than apply for primary credit, to solvent institutions that did not qualify to borrow from the PCF.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;This evolution of the discount window function more closely aligned operations with a theory, often attributed to Walter Bagehot, that central banks should lend freely to solvent institutions against good collateral, at a penalty rate of interest.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>The Fed used its lending tools extensively during the 2008 financial crisis. Relying heavily on discount window lending authority and emergency lending facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed provided emergency liquidity to support individual firms that were under severe stress, and to facilitate the flow of credit more broadly. Of course, the financial crisis left a lasting imprint on many Americans who suffered significant economic harm, many of whom have not yet fully recovered. It also prompted Congress to review and amend the Fed's authorities through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).</p>
<p>The banking system today is stronger and more resilient than it was before the 2008 financial crisis with significantly more capital and substantially more liquidity. U.S. banks are also subject to a host of supervisory tools that did not exist prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, like new stress testing requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Many of the regulatory changes implemented at that time were designed to reduce the probability of large bank failures, but the statute also mandated other changes designed to improve the likelihood that failing large banks could be resolved without broad systemic disruptions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Of course, these changes were additive to existing authorities that are meant to promote banking system resilience, particularly the other core element of the federal safety net, deposit insurance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Congress also made significant changes to the Fed's emergency lending authority. For example, section 13(3) facilities must now be broad-based, rather than designed only for individual firms, and must be approved by the U.S. Treasury Secretary. In addition, loans can only be made to solvent institutions, and there are new collateral and disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Further, while the Dodd-Frank Act preserved the Fed's ability to make discount window loans to eligible borrowers, including depository institutions and U.S. branches of foreign banks, it made some modifications. Notably, one change that I will return to later is the new requirement that discount window lending is no longer confidential. These loans, including the names of borrowing institutions, are now required to be disclosed with a two-year lag.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Changes made by the new law and other subsequent changes have attempted to strike a balance between making firms more resilient to stress and adding additional parameters to the Fed's liquidity tools. The complementary tools we have&mdash;the prudential bank regulatory framework, tools to promote banking system liquidity and stability, discount window lending and "lender of last resort" authority, and resolution tools&mdash;all contribute to the safety and soundness of individual banks, and more broadly, to financial stability.</p>
<p>Broadly defined, the challenge we face is that banking crises and banking stress can arise from unpredictable events. They can be the product of external events (like a global pandemic) or can arise from cascading failures of bank management and regulators to identify and effectively address and mitigate the buildup of risk. This risk can occur at a single institution, like we saw in the lead-up to the failure of SVB, or more broadly throughout the financial system, as we saw during the last financial crisis. When we consider banking system stress and potential crises in the broader context, our primary goal should always be prevention, particularly so that we can avoid contagion risks that lead to financial instability and more significant government intervention. We should be reluctant to intervene in private markets, including using emergency government lending facilities to support private enterprises.</p>
<p>The federal safety net that covers the banking system&mdash;including discount window lending and deposit insurance&mdash;is meant to make the U.S. banking system and broader economy more resilient. Where market disruptions affect liquidity, it is important that these tools&mdash;particularly discount window lending&mdash;function effectively. So, we must ask whether there are steps we can take to optimize the functioning of these tools and identify some of the key challenges we face in making these tools effective, including preserving industry standard access to liquidity outside of the Fed's tools for day-to-day liquidity management, like advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing the Lender of Last Resort Function</strong><br />When we think about the Fed's lender of last resort function, we must think about the broader framework that supports bank liquidity, including liquidity regulation, bank supervision, deposit insurance, and day-to-day liquidity resources. While my discussion today focuses primarily on discount window lending, I will also briefly address design issues that we experienced with the recently expired Bank Term Funding Program.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that the discount window remains a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It operates to support bank liquidity, but it is an additional resource in the federal safety net that allows eligible institutions to weather disruptions in liquidity markets and access other resources.</p>
<p>First, there are questions about the utility of the discount window in light of its scope and the evolution of the banking system. There are a limited set of entities that have access to discount window loans, including depository institutions and, in unusual or exigent circumstances, designated financial market utilities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;As activities continue to migrate out of the regulated banking system, what are the implications of more activity occurring outside the banking system as it relates to the effectiveness of the discount window as a tool?</p>
<p>Second, are there ways in which the Fed can enhance the technology, the operational readiness, and the services underpinning discount window loans to make sure that they are available when needed? Here, the events in the lead-up to the failure of SVB are illuminating&mdash;SVB experienced difficulty in accessing the discount window before its failure. We must understand and evaluate these difficulties and determine whether there are improvements the Federal Reserve System can make to ensure the discount window is an effective tool to provide liquidity support. Are there operational issues that can be improved, whether by improving the technology or extending business hours for the discount window and other Reserve Bank payment services like FedWire<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;and ACH (automated clearinghouse), particularly during times of stress? The Federal Reserve System must also take a close look at our operational readiness and capacity. Banking stress can manifest quickly and outside of regular business hours in different time zones, and we must make sure that the tools we have are available and prepared with trained and experienced staff ready to deal with the evolving risks of liquidity stress and pressure.</p>
<p>Finally, are there changes that need to be made to support contingency liquidity on the borrower side? One prominent issue that has come to light recently is whether there should be some form of pre-positioning requirement&mdash;whether banking institutions should be&nbsp;<em>required&nbsp;</em>to hold collateral at the discount window, in anticipation of the need for accessing discount window loans in the future.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>Arguably, requiring pre-positioning at the discount window may serve a variety of purposes. One use case is ensuring the system is efficient enough to allow borrowers to&nbsp;<em>access&nbsp;</em>discount window loans in a timely manner, including by getting collateral to the discount window to support loans. We have much work to do on this front. To fulfill its function, the discount window must be able to provide liquidity quickly. The failure of SVB demonstrated how rapidly a run can occur and revealed that the discount window must be able to operate in a world in which new technologies, rapid communications, and the growth of real-time payments may exacerbate the speed of a bank run. Identifying and mitigating the technology and operational issues that affect the discount window should go a long way to addressing this concern. Understanding that these problems exist and requiring pre-positioning of collateral at the discount window may not fully address any technological and operational shortcomings of the discount window.</p>
<p>But as a secondary matter, the notion of required collateral pre-positioning has also been proposed as a complementary liquidity requirement for banks, in part to ensure greater liquidity certainty to balance perceived "runnable" funding sources, as with SVB's significant proportion of uninsured deposits. While this could be an effective approach, we do not fully understand the consequences of a new pre-positioning requirement or whether, given the unique nature of SVB's business model and lax supervision, other institutions would have similarly runnable uninsured deposits or if this was an idiosyncratic event.</p>
<p>Further, would required pre-positioning of collateral impede a bank's ability to manage its day-to-day liquidity needs (including from private sources at lower cost)? Would pre-positioning collateral increase operational risk, or otherwise change bank activities? Would there be any unintended consequences from requiring banks to encumber more assets on their balance sheets? More fundamentally&mdash;is a change of this magnitude, requiring a new daily management of discount window lending capacity, necessary and appropriate for all institutions, or are there particular bank characteristics that may warrant this additional layer of liquidity support? These are all important but as yet unanswered questions that need to be explored and understood before imposing such a radical shift.</p>
<p>Currently, banks are not mandated to use the discount window to access liquidity. In fact, one of the core functions of bank management is to make the day-to-day decisions about how the institution will manage liquidity and other responsibilities. While it may be appropriate for supervisors to encourage banks to test contingency funding plans and to evaluate whether those plans are adequate in the context of examination, we must be cautious to not cross the line from supervisor to member of the management team and to avoid interfering with the decisionmaking of bank management by mandating across-the-board changes in response to the failure of a single unique institution.</p>
<p>We need to ask whether having one standardized set of rules for institutions with different activities, risk profiles, and funding structures is the most efficient and effective way to support bank liquidity, particularly as we think about not only stressed conditions and liquidity disruptions in the market, but also day-to-day management and activities.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br />Today's panels will delve into the challenges and design problems that we confront in thinking about liquidity support of the banking system, and the special role of the Federal Reserve as lender of last resort. As a foundation for this discussion, I will briefly touch on a number of these challenges and issues.</p>
<p><strong>Stigma</strong><br />A long-standing challenge to the utility of discount window borrowing is the perception of stigma. During times of stress, signs of banking sector weakness are often magnified through small and independent actions of institutions, which may add to the reluctance to borrow from the central bank when other sources may be available. The perception of stigma existed long before the new Dodd-Frank disclosure requirements, and it is possible that public disclosure of the borrowing&mdash;even with a two-year delay&mdash;may create a greater deterrent. Regardless of the timing of the disclosure, the reality is that market participants have a strong interest in identifying&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>public signals of bank financial health, including discount window lending. Even where the market is just making educated guesses about discount window lending (for example, by looking at public-facing liquidity management activities of banking institutions), the stigma risk can be an important consideration for banks trying to manage public perceptions of their financial condition.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve cannot entirely eliminate discount window borrowing stigma through regulatory fiat. One of the key sources of stigma seems to be the spectrum of reasons that a bank may choose to borrow from the discount window: the need for borrowing could be due to market disruptions in the provision of liquidity or a scarcity in the total amount of reserves in the banking system but could also indicate a specific borrower's growing financial stress. Of course, it is possible that a combination of factors may lead a bank to access the discount window&mdash;as stress on banking institutions builds, there may be a "pullback" on the ordinary liquidity tools banks use, accompanied by increased demands for liquidity.</p>
<p>In this context, discount window lending becomes one additional data point for the market to interpret&mdash;while the signal it may send is unclear, one can easily imagine that the market may be skittish and fixate on any sign of financial weakness. The broader issue, however, is the health of the banking system and particular financial institutions, which can be affected by a number of other factors. For example, as we saw with SVB, the public messaging around the sale of securities and the prospective capital raised were both public announcements that altered the perception of the institution's financial health and risk profile. In short, while discount window "stigma" is an important issue, it is a subset of a broader concern&mdash;the perception of the institution's financial health&mdash;that each bank must confront as it manages its funding resources, risk profile, and liquidity.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should explore ways that the Federal Reserve can work to mitigate stigma concerns. In some ways, the&nbsp;<em>design</em>&nbsp;of primary discount window credit, where a borrower must meet financial standards for borrowing, suggest that the "market signal" of discount window borrowing should perhaps speak more toward market liquidity disruption than an individual institution's financial condition. We should explore ways to validate the use of discount window lending in our regulatory framework. While the federal banking agencies have encouraged institutions to be prepared to access discount window loans, we should also seriously consider whether we should finally recognize discount window borrowing capacity in our assessment of a firm's liquidity resources, including in meeting a firm's obligations under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>One of the emerging arguments about how the Federal Reserve can mitigate stigma concerns is simply by mandating that banks pre-position collateral and periodically borrow from the discount window. The notion is that the "signaling" effect of discount window borrowing becomes more muted when more participants are essentially forced to use it to meet a regulatory requirement or a supervisory expectation. I question whether this approach will truly address the underlying stigma concern.</p>
<p>The discount window has not historically functioned as a source of ordinary day-to-day liquidity for the banking system, but rather as a backup liquidity resource and it is priced as such. Our expectation should not be that the Federal Reserve replaces existing sources of market liquidity for banks in normal times. As a source of&nbsp;<em>backup</em>&nbsp;liquidity, the question becomes whether requiring pre-positioned collateral would mitigate the stigma of&nbsp;<em>drawing&nbsp;</em>on the discount window. To be effective, banks must be willing to obtain<em>&nbsp;</em>discount window loans when needed, and it is not clear that required pre-positioning or even testing requirements will address the perceived stigma associated with a bank's need to access the discount window for emergency liquidity purposes. The market will continue to take signal from a bank's external activities in liquidity markets&mdash;and try to extrapolate whether a bank is using the discount window&mdash;and draw a negative inference from this borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Broad-based Approach to Bank Liquidity</strong><br />The discount window is a small but important element of bank liquidity, but banks manage liquidity in many ways for day-to-day business needs and during times of market stress. Considering discount window reform narrowly ignores the interrelationships among various liquidity resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and liquidity planning. Building resiliency in the financial system requires policymakers to think about these variables together, ensuring that reforms are rational and contribute to a complementary liquidity framework.</p>
<p>The complexity of liquidity issues warrants a broad-based review before we embark on piecemeal changes. That review should endeavor to understand not only the need for reform, but also the tradeoffs of different approaches, including the economic cost. However, the proposed change raises many questions about not only cost and effectiveness, but also unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Another example is the use of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances by some banks as a supplemental source of liquidity, and how this resource functions along the continuum of day-to-day liquidity management to instances of widespread stress in the banking system and among individual firms. The FHLBs are an important source of liquidity for many banks. At the same time, the operational design of FHLB advances make these advances poorly suited to function as emergency liquidity support for the banking system. By contrast, the Fed's discount window lending authority, and the flexible authority to lend under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, place the Fed well to function as the lender of last resort in support of banking system liquidity during times of stress.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on the Design of Emergency Lending Facilities: The Bank Term Funding Program</strong><br />Before closing, I would like to briefly reflect on events we saw this winter, when design flaws with the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) were first identified. On March 12, 2023, the Federal Reserve, with the approval of the Treasury Secretary, announced the creation of the BTFP, which was designed to make additional funding available to institutions to "help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;This program was initially authorized to make new loans for a full year, even though at the time, it was not clear that "unusual and exigent" circumstances would continue to exist for a full year that would warrant the ongoing availability of loans under the program.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Under the BTFP, eligible depository institutions were able to pledge Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities&mdash;<em>valued at par</em>&mdash;to obtain one-year loans. This program allowed institutions to avoid selling those assets to generate additional liquidity. By valuing the collateral at par&mdash;when the market value had declined due to the rising interest rate environment&mdash;the program allowed eligible borrowers to obtain a greater amount of liquidity than they would have been able to by simply pledging collateral to the discount window.</p>
<p>These generous collateral terms were accompanied by generous rate terms and prepayment flexibility. As originally designed, the interest rate for loans under the program was set at the one-year overnight index swap rate, plus 10 basis points.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Borrowers were also entitled to prepay loans at any time without penalty.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;As has been well documented, the combination of these terms over time created a significant arbitrage opportunity, which the Fed sensibly cut off as the program was approaching the end of its term for originating new loans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240403a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>We must learn from this experience. When we identify flaws in program design or ways to improve our tools in the future, we should avail ourselves of the knowledge we have learned through experience, including by shutting down an authorized section 13(3) facility when it is no longer needed, and lending at a true penalty rate so the usage of the facility naturally declines as market conditions normalize.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />As regulatory attention turns toward the liquidity framework and liquidity regulation, I expect we will see a growing momentum to "do something" that would help address the banking stress from 2023. While some reforms may be necessary, we should think about the response to banking stress more broadly.</p>
<p>We should continue to focus on improving the targeted approach of supervision, to enhance the "prevention" of banking system stress. We should think about the liquidity framework in a broad-based manner to ensure that the available tools, resources, and requirements are working in a complementary way. And we should understand what changes we need to make discount window lending and other emergency lending programs more efficient and effective.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to take part in this important and timely discussion, and for the participation of our esteemed panelists in this important event. I look forward to hearing the panelists' perspectives.</p>

<title>Dun &amp; Bradstreet: Global Business Optimism Continues To Climb As Businesses Indicate Sustained Confidence - Global Supply Chain Continuity Index Continues To Decline Amid Disruptions In Trade Routes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, today released its Q2 2024 Global Business Optimism Insights report. The latest quarterly report highlights a sustained positive trend in the global business outlook, with the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Global Business Optimism Index rising 5.4% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p>While there has been continued improvement in business optimism, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's forward-looking report reveals a persistently declining optimism in the Global Supply Chain Continuity Index, which slipped 8% for Q2, following a 6% decline in Q1. The primary reason for this decline is the forced rerouting of shipments due to geopolitical events across major trade routes. Dun &amp; Bradstreet's survey data shows that 1 in 7 businesses find their operations were impacted by supply chain disruption. However, businesses are adapting by implementing contingency plans and diversifying their supplier base across different regions.</p>
<p>"The continued improvement in overall business optimism indicates that businesses are regaining stability after grappling with inflationary pressures and global monetary tightening," said Neeraj Sahai, President of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International. "Today's supply chains face unprecedented risks from volatile trade relations, civil unrests, extreme weather, and disasters such as the recent incident in Baltimore. Increasingly businesses are mitigating these risks by leveraging data to identify opportunities for reshoring, nearshoring, and friend shoring."</p>
<p>Key findings from the Q2 report reveals:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Optimism Index</b>&nbsp;increased 5.4%, with businesses feeling more optimistic about the global macroeconomic environment, particularly regarding inflation. For the first time since the launch of the survey in 2023, businesses are optimistic about input costs, aiding a recovery in optimism for manufacturers globally.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Supply Chain Continuity Index</b>&nbsp;continues to slip, declining 8% in the quarter. Geopolitical tensions are causing supply chain disruptions across major trade routes, compelling businesses to adopt lengthier alternative routes. Nearly 1 in 6 businesses are increasing investments in supply chain risk management to mitigate disruptions.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Financial Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;was essentially unchanged for the quarter, falling 0.4%. Firms remain optimistic about operating conditions supporting balance sheets. Among advanced economies, the index fell 2.3% but improved 5.5% for emerging economies.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Investment Confidence Index&nbsp;</b>fell 5.4%. The largest drop in confidence was with small businesses in advanced economies, recording a 17% decline. The index decline signals a realigned consensus that major central banks in advanced economies will begin to start a period of looser monetary policy around mid-year &ndash; later than previously anticipated &ndash; delaying investment decisions. Nearly 1 in 6 businesses report that recent geopolitical events have impeded their investment plans.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business ESG Index</b>&nbsp;dipped 3%, though firms maintain a favorable view toward adopting sustainability. ESG sentiment in both emerging and advanced economies declined 3%, although the former maintains a higher optimism level.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Descriptions and information about the indices can be found on page 25 of the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Optimism regarding input costs has reached an all-time high, contributing to a surge in optimism among manufacturers worldwide, which has increased by 17%," said Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist, Dun &amp; Bradstreet. "Nevertheless, persistent geopolitical disruptions have made significant impacts on supply chains, and now they may also impede investment decisions. With half of the world set to vote in 2024, businesses are anticipated to closely monitor the evolving policy landscape throughout the year. It is crucial for them to strategically prepare for and navigate these challenges."</p>
<p><b>About the Global Business Optimism Insights Report</b></p>
<p>The Global Business Optimism Insights report is a&nbsp;synthesis of data from a comprehensive survey encompassing 32 economies,&nbsp;covering approximately 10,000 businesses and 17 sectors, alongside insights from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, leveraging the firm's proprietary data and economic expertise. The report is an amalgamation of five indices which reflect overall business optimism and expectations about supply chain continuity, financial and investment conditions and ESG initiatives. The indices range from 0 to 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an improvement and a reading below 50 indicating a deterioration in optimism.</p>

<div> record, ADV, trading, preliminary, fees
<br />
Record total credit ADV of $15.0 billion, driven by increases in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, and Eurobonds ADV. Preliminary variable transaction fees per million decreased.
<br />
Summary:<br />Record total credit ADV of $15.0 billion, driven by increases in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, and Eurobonds ADV. Preliminary variable transaction fees per million decreased. <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for March and the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first quarter, we delivered<b>&nbsp;record</b>&nbsp;total credit ADV of&nbsp;<b>$15.0 billion</b>, driven by an&nbsp;<b>18.0%</b>&nbsp;increase in U.S. high-grade ADV, a&nbsp;<b>17.3%</b>&nbsp;increase in emerging markets ADV and a&nbsp;<b>10.6%</b>&nbsp;increase in Eurobonds ADV.&nbsp;<b>Record levels of ADV</b>&nbsp;across these product areas helped offset significantly lower levels of U.S. high-yield trading activity on the platform, driven by continued low levels of credit spread volatility. The roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro is continuing and client engagement is increasing with approximately&nbsp;<b>12.5%</b>&nbsp;of U.S. credit trading volume executed on X-Pro in the quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Select 1Q24 highlights*</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">

U.S. high-yield estimated market ADV increased&nbsp;<b>0.5%</b>. We believe the decrease in U.S. high-yield estimated market share year-over-year was driven, in part, by&nbsp;<b>lower levels of credit spread volatility</b>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<b>greater focus on the new issue calendar</b>&nbsp;by our long only client segment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1">&mdash; Lower levels of credit spread volatility drove an estimated&nbsp;<b>54.3%</b>&nbsp;decrease in ETF market maker client activity on the platform, and high-yield ETF notional market volume traded declined&nbsp;<b>25.2%</b>&nbsp;compared to 1Q23.<br /><br />&mdash; U.S. high-yield new issuance was&nbsp;<b>$87.6 billion</b>&nbsp;in 1Q24, up&nbsp;<b>116.5%</b>&nbsp;from the prior year.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><b>Record</b>&nbsp;emerging markets ADV of&nbsp;<b>$3.6 billion</b>, up&nbsp;<b>17.3%</b>. The year-over-year increase was due to a&nbsp;<b>13.1%</b>&nbsp;increase in hard currency trading ADV and&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;local currency markets ADV, up&nbsp;<b>29.8%</b>.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Total rates ADV of&nbsp;<b>$17.7 billion</b>, down&nbsp;<b>27.9%</b>&nbsp;versus the prior year.</li>
<li>The preliminary FPM<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for total credit for 1Q24 was approximately&nbsp;<b>$154</b>, compared to&nbsp;<b>$165&nbsp;</b>in the prior year, and&nbsp;<b>$156</b>&nbsp;in 4Q23. The decline in total credit FPM compared to the prior year was due principally to product mix shift. The preliminary FPM for total rates was<b>&nbsp;</b>approximately<b>&nbsp;$4.70</b>, compared to&nbsp;<b>$4.12</b>&nbsp;in the prior year.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close to 500 footballers from the Singapore Premier League (SPL) and Women&rsquo;s Premier League (WPL) will head to a different form of training camp later this month &ndash; to learn how to manage their personal finances and investments during their football careers and beyond.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) and as part of SGX Group&rsquo;s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, SGX Cares, where financial literacy is one of the key pillars, the training camp is curated to equip the footballers with the fundamentals of financial management and investing which are essential building blocks to financial resilience.</p>

Investor education events will take place across the U.S. with various audiences, including students, underrepresented communities, older investors, and the military.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investors turn to our capital markets every day, whether to grow a nest egg, plan for retirement, save for an education, or prepare for the inevitable bumps along the way,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;To be an informed investor is to be a more effective investor, and I encourage the public to take advantage of the many resources we offer on Investor.gov.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the SEC&rsquo;s latest resources to educate investors about the importance of financial capability and avoiding fraud, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>April&rsquo;s Financial Capability Month Investing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/spotlight/investing-quizzes">Quiz</a>;</li>
<li>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/sites/investorgov/files/2023-10/guideforolderinvestors.pdf">Guide for Older Investors</a>;</li>
<li>A Military Investor Bulletin, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins/making">Making the Most of Lump Sum Benefits</a>&rdquo;;</li>
<li>An Investor Alert: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/artificial-intelligence-fraud">Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Investment Fraud</a>&rdquo;; and</li>
<li>An article from OIEA Director Lori Schock, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/spotlight/directors-take/loud-and-proud-budgeting-may-help-you-stick-your-saving-and-investing-plan">Loud (and Proud) Budgeting May Help You Stick To Your Saving and Investing Plan</a>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loud budgeting concept can be an empowering way to take control of your financial future,&rdquo; said Director Lori Schock. &ldquo;Creating a saving and investing plan that helps you meet your financial goals and sharing those ideals and goals with your family and friends may not only help you stay more committed to your decision-making but can provide you with support to help you stick with your plan for the long term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the SEC&rsquo;s events planned for Financial Capability Month, include reaching out to the following:</p>
<p><span>Older Investors</span>&nbsp;&ndash; As part of its ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/information/older-investors">Never Stop Learning initiative</a>, OIEA leadership and staff will participate in interviews, webinars, and other events aimed at providing investor education and fraud prevention resources to older investors. OIEA leadership will appear on a Facebook Live event with the AARP Fraud Watch Network and The Senior Zone radio program. SEC regional office and headquarters staff will conduct webinars and give presentations to older adults at public libraries and community centers.</p>
<p><span>High School and College Students</span>&nbsp;&ndash; OIEA staff will lead financial education activities for high school and college students throughout the month. OIEA staff will present to Washington, D.C., public high school students, leading lessons on investor education basics and concepts like the power of compound growth and avoiding scams. Staff will engage with additional schools to educate high school students about the importance of building wealth throughout their lifetime and help them realize the benefits of starting young to grow their money over time. OIEA staff will give guest lectures to college students at Haskell Indian Nations University, Kansas State University, and Dalton State College. Guest lectures will cover investor education topics, such as the relationship between paying down debt, saving and investing, how to avoid fraud, and the importance of creating a saving and investing plan. OIEA staff will also join financial education events for students and young adults hosted by the New York City Bar Association. SEC regional office and headquarters staff will also present to Historically Black College and University student groups at Morgan State University and other universities and community colleges.</p>
<p><span>Service Members</span>&nbsp;&ndash; OIEA staff will present to service members at military installations across the country. Programs will focus on building wealth, protecting investments by recognizing and avoiding scams, and discussing the benefits of tax-advantaged retirement plans, including the military&rsquo;s Thrift Savings Plan. Outreach events will include active duty, reserve, and retired service members, as well as veterans and military families. This work builds on the SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investor education outreach with service members, veterans, and their families.</p>
<p><span>Community Organizations and Affinity Groups</span>&nbsp;&ndash; OIEA staff will conduct &ldquo;train the trainer&rdquo; sessions for financial educators at the Creating Assets, Savings and Hope (CASH) Campaign of Maryland Financial Education Summit. OIEA staff will also present a Building Wealth Over Time workshop to Howard County, Maryland, community members as part of their Money Matters community event series. OIEA staff will participate in a Washington, D.C., job training and life skills event for formerly incarcerated citizens. SEC regional office and headquarters staff will engage in dozens of outreach events across the country, including investor education presentations to employee groups, women's groups, and more.</p>

<title>CalPERS Selects Stephen Gilmore As Chief Investment Officer</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-selects-stephen-gilmore-as-chief-investment-officer/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> New Zealand Super Fund, Chief investment officer, CalPERS, Retirement benefits, Sustainable Investments <br />
Summary:<br />Stephen Gilmore appointed as CalPERS chief investment officer. Overseen New Zealand Super Fund, Australia's sovereign wealth fund, and global investment positions. Annual salary $718,750. <div>
<p>The California Public Employees' Retirement System has selected Stephen Gilmore, a senior investment leader with extensive experience in public and private financial institutions and across cultures and geographies, as the pension fund's chief investment officer.</p>
<p>His appointment is expected to become effective in July.</p>
<p>Gilmore, an internationally recognized investment leader whose career has spanned 40 years, comes to CalPERS after more than five years as the chief investment officer of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZ Super Fund), a sovereign wealth fund owned by the New Zealand government and valued at more than $73 billion (NZD).</p>
<p>"Stephen has worked in very public roles during his career for organizations where transparency and resiliency are essential," said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. "He brings not only a wealth of investing knowledge to the job, but he also has the temperament to understand the needs of our members and public sector employers who depend on CalPERS to be a steady, long-term partner."</p>
<p>As chief investment officer for NZ Super Fund since 2019, Gilmore has overseen the world's best-performing sovereign fund, with annual investment returns of more than 12% a year over the past decade.</p>
<p>"Stephen brings an unmatched knowledge of global investing and managing diverse and high-performing investment professionals," said CalPERS President Theresa Taylor. "We conducted an exhaustive, worldwide search for a deeply skilled leader to continue our mission of providing retirement benefits to California's public sector workers, and we are confident Stephen is the right person for the job."</p>
<p>Gilmore was chief investment strategist of the Future Fund, Australia's sovereign wealth fund. There, he oversaw efforts such as portfolio strategy, portfolio overlays, and investment risk. He has also held senior international positions with AIG Financial Products and Morgan Stanley, as well as assignments with the International Monetary Fund and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful to CalPERS' leaders for the trust they've put in me to help shape the pension fund's next chapter," Gilmore said. "There are high expectations, and rightly so, when it comes to fulfilling the promises made in serving those who serve California."</p>
<p>Gilmore succeeds Nicole Musicco, who left CalPERS last September. As chief investment officer, he will oversee a team of more than 300 investment professionals and a portfolio valued at $494.6 billion. His arrival comes shortly after the launch of a sweeping Sustainable Investments 2030 plan, which includes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2023/calpers-announces-100-billion-net-zero-pledge-and-new-climate-accountability-measures" target="_self">investing $100 billion in climate solutions over the next six years</a>.</p>
<p>The annual salary for the position, not including incentives based on fund performance relative to established benchmarks, is $718,750.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, 1930s Reforms, Trading Rules, Efficient Markets, Best Execution
Summary:
Efficient capital markets, trust, and liquidity benefit from reforms, such as shorter settlement cycles, incentivizing competition, and ensuring best execution. <div>
<p class="paragraph">Thank you, Erik, for that kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Upon passage of the Securities Act of 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress knew their job wasn&rsquo;t done. While they knew the &ldquo;Truth in Securities Act&rdquo; was consequential, Roosevelt and Congress understood it had not yet dealt with key problems in the securities markets.</p>
<p>The 1920s was a time when markets were rife with fraud and manipulation. This led to a fundamental breakdown of trust in the capital markets.</p>
<p>Congress responded with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They also set up the Securities and Exchange Commission, embedding the word &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; right in our name.</p>
<p>There was much debate about these reforms.</p>
<p>Sam Rayburn, then Chair of the Commerce Committee and later Speaker of the House, said the legislation was being considered &ldquo;under the pressure of the most vicious and persistent lobby that any of us have ever known in Washington.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Congressman Fred Britten, speaking about Rayburn&rsquo;s legislation, argued that &ldquo;the real object of the bill is to Russianize everything.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Given such opposition, naturally the final bill had a series of compromises. At its core, though, it was about enhancing the integrity of and building trust in our capital markets through the oversight of exchanges, broker-dealers, and the trading of securities in secondary markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As Joe Kennedy, the first Chair of the SEC said so eloquently, &ldquo;[T]he community thus exposed to fraud and manipulation should welcome the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commission it created.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>It was four decades later that Congress and President Gerald Ford came back with significant reforms to promote efficiency and competition in the capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Congress was addressing problems related to fixed commissions. They were reacting to the back office &ldquo;Paperwork Crisis&rdquo; of the 1960s. There were issues resulting from emerging technologies. There also were challenges regarding how self-regulatory organizations (SROs) set their rules.</p>
<p>Through the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Congress for the first time gave the SEC authority to establish a National Market System for securities transactions. They gave the SEC authority for a national quoting system for securities. They gave us authority over the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. Further, they gave us new and revised authority regarding review and setting of SRO rules.</p>
<p>Congress found, as articulated in section 11A, that it was in the public interest and for the protection of investors to assure &ldquo;fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Congress inserted the word competition in 20 places in the securities laws.</p>
<p>Two Congresses and two Presidents, Roosevelt and Ford, understood how important our capital markets are to investors, issuers, and more broadly to our economy. They were focused on two key public goods: first, instilling greater trust, and second, instilling greater efficiency and competition in the capital markets.</p>
<p>Promoting trust in the capital markets by reducing fraud and manipulation benefits investors and issuers alike. Such trust means more investors are willing to invest in the markets with confidence. It means issuers can rely on the markets to price their offerings. Well-functioning markets provide price discovery that helps capital flow to its most productive uses.</p>
<p>Efficiency and competition mean the central functioning of the capital markets is less costly, so investors get better returns. Issuers can raise money more efficiently. When market participants know that they can get a competitive price when selling or buying, they are more likely to invest in the primary market in the first place.&nbsp;Moreover, competition and efficiency allow prices to come closest to fundamental value, aiding price discovery and capital formation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efficiency and competition also promote another externality&mdash;greater depth of liquidity in the markets. As they say, liquidity begets liquidity.</p>
<p>Congress understood these public goods could not be achieved by private markets on their own. Private incentives are likely insufficient when it comes to setting rules for the capital markets.&nbsp;Well-functioning markets create positive externalities for the American public that aren&rsquo;t fully internalized by private entities.&nbsp;Leaving it to the private markets alone would lead to under-investment in policies that best promote trust, efficiency, and competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the SEC has an important role to play. The need to promote these public goods is constant. Given everchanging technology and business models, though, we have an obligation to update the rules of the road, always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency, competition, and liquidity in the markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With the emergence of the internet, under Chair Arthur Levitt, the Commission in 1998 comprehensively defined &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; under SEC rules and adopted a framework for alternative trading systems (ATSs).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Chair Bill Donaldson, the Commission updated the National Market System rules in 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Chair Donaldson said at the time: &ldquo;We are addressing a complex set of problems that have lingered in the marketplace for years, that have caused substantial discord among market participants and that have resulted in inferior outcomes for investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<h3>Clearance and Settlement</h3>
<p><br />In the 1975 reforms, Congress added Section 17A to the Securities Exchange Act and directed the SEC to fulfill an important role overseeing securities clearinghouses. Later, in 1986&mdash;after a dozen nonbank Treasury dealers failed, sending shudders into the banking system&mdash;Congress broadened the SEC&rsquo;s authority to include clearinghouses in the Treasury markets.</p>
<p>Clearinghouses are vital to our capital markets. They facilitate what one might call the market plumbing, that which happens after you execute a transaction through the time that it settles. Standing in the middle of the securities markets, clearinghouses are the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.</p>
<p>A bit of history might surprise everyone, but the U.S. stock market settled at T+1 well into the 1920s. It was only with increasing volumes that the market plumbing was lengthened to a business week after a transaction (T+5).</p>
<p>It took the Stock Market Crash of 1987 before the Commission implemented our first settlement rule in 1995. That&rsquo;s when we shortened the settlement cycle to three business days after the trade date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;We shortened it to two business days after the trade date in 2017.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we adopted rules to shorten it to one business day, which will be implemented on May 28, 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would note our U.S. government securities market has been on a T+1 settlement cycle ever since we started central clearing of U.S. treasuries in 1986. We also have a T+1 settlement cycle in securities options markets, much of the derivatives markets, and as the normal practice for certain mutual funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Thus, on May 28, we&rsquo;re aligning the rest of the U.S. securities markets to T+1. I encourage all market participants to ensure that they are ready for the upcoming transition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also adopted rules in December 2023 to facilitate additional central clearing for the $27 trillion U.S. Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The final rules make changes to enhance customer clearing and broaden the scope of which transactions clearinghouse members must clear. Enhanced access to central clearing can facilitate all-to-all trading, competition, and resiliency in these markets. These rules help fulfill Congress&rsquo;s mandates to promote efficiency, competition, liquidity, and resiliency in the markets.</p>
<h3>Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems</h3>
<p><br />A lot has changed in the capital markets in the 26 years since Chair Levitt&rsquo;s Commission adopted Regulation ATS. Electronification and new methods of trading have advanced significantly. Much of the secondary markets in Treasuries is facilitated by interdealer broker (IDB) electronic platforms. Further, principal-trading firms have been participating to a greater degree, representing approximately 61 percent of the volume in 2019 on the IDB platforms in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The growing importance to investors and the overall market structure of exempted platforms led to the Commission, under Chair Jay Clayton, to put out a proposal with regard to ATSs for government securities and a concept release on fixed-income market structure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Based upon public input, in 2022, we reproposed rules for ATSs for government securities and proposed to modernize the definition of an exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Commenters had noted that much of secondary market trading in Treasuries and corporate bonds also were facilitated by request-for-quote (RFQ) electronic platforms between dealers and customers.</p>
<p>In particular, the Commission in 2022 sought feedback on whether the definition of an exchange should include platforms, such as RFQ platforms, that perform exchange-like functions in the Treasury markets and elsewhere. While they may not have central limit order books, these are venues where multiple buyers can meet multiple sellers, use structured methods to negotiate a trade, and can agree to the terms of a trade.</p>
<p>Ensuring that such exchange-like platforms follow our exchange-specific rules could benefit investors and markets alike.</p>
<h3>National Market System</h3>
<p><br />In terms of the National Market System, a great deal has changed since we adopted Regulation NMS in 2005. In particular, a large and growing amount of equity trading now occurs in what many call the dark markets, particularly off-exchange market centers such as wholesalers and dark pools.</p>
<p>Trade volumes went up about twofold to 11 billion shares per day from 2007 to 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The one-penny minimum increment used for quoting is outdated, and too wide for many of the securities trading in today&rsquo;s markets. Thus, we proposed a rule to narrow the minimum tick size, making it smaller than a penny for many securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The proposal also would update the more than 120-year-old definition<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;of round lot<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;by determining the size of round lots by the share price. The proposal also would add quotes on odd-lots to core data.</p>
<p>Further, it would bring greater transparency to the access fees charged and related rebates paid by exchanges. In addition, it would lower what exchanges may charge investors to access protected quotes.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposed rules last fall regarding exchanges&rsquo; volume-based transaction rebates and fees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Currently, midsized and smaller exchange member broker-dealers effectively pay higher fees than larger members to trade on most exchanges. Members with the largest trading volume receive the largest rebates and thus pay the lowest net fees.</p>
<h3>Best Execution</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long considered broker-dealers&rsquo; best execution duty to their customers to be critical to both trust and competition in the markets.</p>
<p>Thus, I was surprised to learn when I came to the SEC that the Commission actually didn&rsquo;t have its own best execution rule. The best execution rule was instituted, instead, by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an SRO, and it was last updated in 2014.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), another SRO, implemented its first best execution rule for municipal securities in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p>I believe a best execution standard is too central to the SEC&rsquo;s mandate to protect investors, not to have on the books as a Commission rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Rapid developments in our markets make best execution that much more important.</p>
<h3>Order Competition and Execution Quality</h3>
<p><br />Every day, investors turn to broker-dealers in the markets&mdash;often through brokerage apps&mdash;to build a better financial future.</p>
<p>How do you know, however, the quality of the broker&rsquo;s execution of your order? You can turn to measures that compare the price you received with what&rsquo;s called the National Best Bid and Offer at a particular time.</p>
<p>This information is measurable, but historically the brokers whose apps you&rsquo;re using haven&rsquo;t been required to disclose execution quality in that way.</p>
<p>Thus, last month we finalized rules to require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>We also proposed a rule in 2022 regarding exposing marketable orders of individual investors of a certain size to fair and open auctions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>About 90 percent of individual investors&rsquo; marketable orders in NMS stocks are routed to a small group of off-exchange wholesalers, operating in the dark market. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to promote the greatest competition or fairness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback on this proposal and are considering all of the comments.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><br />The U.S. capital markets are a national asset. Trust in the markets is a public good. Capital market efficiency, competition, and liquidity are public goods.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress understood this in the 1930s. Ford and Congress understood this in the 1970s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They also understood that the need for the SEC to promote these public goods is evergreen. Technology and business models, though, are everchanging.</p>
<p>Thus, as we have done for 90 years, we will continue to update rules of the road for investors and issuers alike.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders Australian Swap Dealer To Pay $500,000 For Supervision Failures</title>

<div> Order, ANZ, CFTC, surveillance, penalty
<br />
ANZ violated supervision obligations by failing to ensure its spoofing surveillance tool was effective, resulting in a $500,000 penalty.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.</span>&nbsp;(ANZ), a financial services firm provisionally registered as a swap dealer for violating its supervision obligations for failing&nbsp;</span><span>to ensure its spoofing surveillance tool was operating effectively.</span>&nbsp;<span><span>ANZ admitted the facts in the order.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The order requires ANZ to pay a $500,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations as charged.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>During the course of a CFTC investigation into ANZ&rsquo;s trading activity, ANZ disclosed to CFTC staff that a surveillance tool ANZ used to monitor for spoofing activity by its traders was not operating effectively for futures data supplied by one vendor from November 2019 to June 2020 (First Gap Period) and then again from November 2020 to February 2021 (Second Gap Period). For both the First and Second Gap Periods, there was a mismatch between the time when the relevant data was ingested into the surveillance tool and the time when the tool was run.&nbsp;</span></span><span>The surveillance tool was run against, among other things, trading in Eurodollar futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which ANZ used in part to hedge its various swap positions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Specifically, during the two Gap Periods, the tool was run on a daily basis before certain data was ingested into the tool, and thus the tool failed to surveil any of the futures data from the vendor at issue. Moreover, even after discovering the First Gap Period and resetting the time so the tool would be run after the relevant data was received, ANZ did not put into place additional safeguards to prevent the timing issue from recurring. In fact, the issue did recur. The Second Gap Period was caused by the exact same problem as the First Gap Period, and lasted for approximately four additional months before ANZ discovered it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As a result, thousands of orders were not timely surveilled for spoofing and ANZ should have, but did not receive a substantial number of surveillance alerts that would have been generated during the two Gap Periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In accepting ANZ&rsquo;s offer, the CFTC recognized ANZ&rsquo;s substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation of this matter. The CFTC also acknowledged ANZ&rsquo;s representations concerning its remediation in connection with this matter. Specifically, during the investigation, ANZ disclosed both Gap Periods to the CFTC. ANZ also represented that it corrected the timing mismatch as soon as it became aware of it, and following the Second Gap Period, installed additional safeguards to prevent a recurrence. The CFTC&rsquo;s recognition of ANZ&rsquo;s substantial cooperation and remediation is further reflected in the form of a reduced penalty.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Devin Cain, Trevor Kokal, Jordon Grimm, Alejandra de Urioste, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal Sultan, and former staff member Steven I. Ringer.</span></span></span></p>

<div> Regulatory Trajectory, Future of Banking, Bank Mergers, De Novo Bank Formation, Regulatory Approvals
<br />
Summary:
Regulatory challenges for banking future, impact of reform measures, barriers to new bank formation, concerns with M&amp;A process. 
 <div>
<p>Good morning. Before I provide some context for today's discussions, I would like to thank all of our participants who are here with us today in Kansas City at the Reserve Bank, and those participating remotely. Most importantly, I'd like to thank our host, President Schmid, and his excellent research staff, all of whom helped to organize today's event. I especially appreciate the opportunity to highlight a few specific areas that concern me about the currently regulatory trajectory and their effects on the future of banking.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Today's workshop addresses timely and important questions, including the forces that will shape the future of the banking system, entry into the banking system, bank mergers and acquisitions, and the state of competition including both the direct and indirect competition banks experience and how regulators measure and assess competition&mdash;or at least how we broadly measure it today.</p>
<p>The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank just over a year ago, and the stress to the banking system that ensued, caused many institutions to retrench and prompted regulators to renew their focus on bank regulatory and supervisory policy and approach. Banks responded by enhancing their focus on fundamental risks like interest rate and liquidity risk, adopting a more conservative posture in both risk management and lending. This self-reflection by both industry and regulators continues today. In fact, the long shadow of the bank failures continues to be a driving force for regulatory and supervisory reforms, even for reform proposals that have little relationship to the events surrounding the bank failures and ensuing banking system stress.</p>
<p>As I have noted in the past, the regulatory reform agenda, and the less visible but no less important changes to the supervisory process, touch on a wide range of topics that directly and indirectly affect banks of all sizes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The sheer volume of changes presents challenges to regulated institutions. Outside of the largest banks, how does bank management review and provide meaningful comment on voluminous regulatory changes? When those changes are finalized, how does a bank's management reallocate resources to ensure a capability to comply with revised regulations? Are banks, especially small banks, able to locate and retain qualified staff to understand and implement these increasingly complex and burdensome rules? How does a bank's management and compliance officer adjust to supervisory standards and expectations that may be significantly different from exam to exam or regulator to regulator?</p>
<p>The 2023 bank failures and circumstances leading up to those failures continue to warrant review, self-reflection, and appropriately targeted changes to identified issues or failures in regulation and supervision. But we should ask whether the volume of reforms that have been proposed, recently finalized, or that are in the pipeline, reflect appropriate prioritization. Or instead, do they suggest that we have lost our focus on furthering the primary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision&mdash;promoting a safe and sound banking system and fostering a thriving banking industry that effectively supports local and regional economies. I am concerned that the broad-based and insufficiently focused reform agenda has become a growing source of risk to the banking system, particularly due to the rushed nature of these reform efforts and the lack of research and understanding of the intended and unintended consequences of these proposals.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This reform agenda, for both regulation and supervision, is the backdrop for today's panel discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approvals in the Banking System</strong><br />I have previously spoken about the regulatory dynamics shaping the future of the banking system, from bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for services (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to "11" for banks of all sizes, increased competition from non-banks, the continued migration of certain activities from regulated banks to non-banks outside of the banking system, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;These issues continue to shape the contours of the banking system&mdash;including bank size, the activities in which they engage, and where activities occur within the broader financial system. The policy decisions embedded in these regulatory reforms, even if only in the form of a proposal, have already begun shaping the U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>Revisions to the regulatory and supervisory framework reflect policy decisions about not only the risk tolerance of regulators, but also the role of banks in the banking system and the broader U.S. economy. These policy decisions create incentives and impacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and standardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for banks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new banks to successfully compete with existing banks.</p>
<p>When we "raise the bar" for banks to engage in certain activities in a way that is disproportionate to the risk of those activities, we create incentives for those activities to migrate to non-banks outside of the regulatory perimeter. We must understand whether the policy decisions embedded in the regulatory and supervisory framework are effective and complementary. If they are not, we must acknowledge the consequences of knowingly implementing conflicting policy choices.</p>
<p><strong>De Novo Bank Formation</strong><br />I continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. As I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank creation indicated by the ongoing preference for "charter strip" acquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>For the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as the banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time period. Many factors influence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services providers to operate outside of the regulated banking system.</p>
<p>The decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business considerations including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and ensuring the ability to navigate the "start-up" phase of a new bank and manage upfront operational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first several years of de novo bank operation. Yet, perhaps the most important factor that influences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework, which includes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation. Applications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application filing with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) application for deposit insurance. The timeframe for receiving all of the required regulatory approvals to open for business often takes well in excess of a year. Of course, this uncertainty must be endured after initial capital has been raised, shareholders identified, and a management team ready to begin work. As one can imagine, these delays can present unique challenges for de novo founders including incurring more start-up expenses than anticipated, having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified management to obtain approval, and experiencing challenges raising additional start-up capital investment.</p>
<p>Some of the uncertainty surrounding the de novo process flows from supervisory perceptions of this proposed business model. For example, a de novo business plan that focuses on providing banking-as-a-service outside of a defined geographic footprint presents different risks than a business model that focuses on retail banking in an underserved market. It stands to reason that the regulatory expectations for each business model, including capital levels, risk management, and compliance, will vary. Even controlling for the variability in business model, the standards and expectations for a de novo application that will be viewed and treated favorably are opaque and may shift significantly over time, even between and among the regulators.</p>
<p>The absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the banking system, a void that may contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and fairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the continued shift of banking activities beyond the regulatory perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</strong><br />A more immediate concerning influence is the dramatically evolving approach to bank mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by some prudential regulators. It is helpful to consider bank M&amp;A broadly, to include not only bank-to-bank mergers subject to approval under the Bank Merger Act, but also the broader set of business combinations contemplated under sections 3 and 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, and under section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>These M&amp;A transactions allow banks to thrive in our dynamic banking system, and help to promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&amp;A also ensures that some institutions have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence of a viable M&amp;A framework, we increase the potential for additional risks including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities and zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.</p>
<p>M&amp;A reform is currently a popular topic on the banking agency regulatory agenda with the process and standards regulators employ to review and approve transactions under intense scrutiny. Recently some of the federal banking regulators have proposed or described new M&amp;A policy approaches, with the Department of Justice currently reviewing how it enforces section 7 of the Clayton Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>As regulators revisit the evaluation standards for bank M&amp;A transactions under the statutory framework, we should consider whether the regulatory review process is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. This should begin with an important threshold question&mdash;what are the identified shortcomings with the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings?</p>
<p>One concern that has been raised about the M&amp;A regulatory approval process seems largely based on the misconception that a lack of application&nbsp;<em>denials&nbsp;</em>implies that standards are simply not rigorous enough, that the regulatory approval process has become a rubber stamp. This view ignores the reality of the filing process. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition.</p>
<p>This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers take extremely seriously. They do not make the decision to file an application lightly. Even for those institutions that decide to proceed with an application, success is not guaranteed, even in the absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve's most recent report on banking applications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&amp;A transactions in which applications have been withdrawn.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In its recent proposal, one agency suggested that if an applicant withdraws a filing, that agency's board may release a statement regarding the concerns with the application in the interest of creating transparency for future applicants.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;I have observed that applicants may withdraw a filing for a number of reasons, including prolonged uncertainty due to regulatory delays, expiration of contractual deadlines, and issues that are uncovered only during the processing of the application (for example, the issuance of updated supervisory ratings from recently completed examinations). As a general matter, this approach could evolve to become the expectation for&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>withdrawn applications, and, if so, could put regulators in the untenable position of needing to disclose confidential supervisory information or nonpublic business information about applicants even in the case of a withdrawn application.</p>
<p>Just as in the de novo bank formation process, one of the key risks to an effective M&amp;A process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.</p>
<p>Reducing the efficiency of bank M&amp;A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions&mdash;it can reduce the effectiveness of M&amp;A activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a "protected class" of larger institutions.</p>
<p>Given all of these considerations, it seems reasonable to assume that the uncertainty of the M&amp;A process itself may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential bank founders stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies&mdash;like the strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer&mdash;may face long odds of success. We must not foreclose bank merger activities that are permitted by law and that are necessary to maintain a healthy banking system.</p>
<p>Instead, we should focus on ensuring that we can improve the speed and timeliness of regulatory decisionmaking, applying review standards that are reasonable and consistent with the statutory framework. Too often it seems that regulators discount the fact that these organizations do not simply hit the pause button during the merger review process. We must remember that these organizations are businesses that continue to operate and must do so in a way that supports their ongoing business operations and future growth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly focused on other issues, with the timeliness of regulatory action appearing to be lower on the list of priorities. These efforts have not improved the outlook for the bank merger process. Pending reform efforts may actually exacerbate the existing problems, resulting in an increase in the already significant delays in processing times for some applications.</p>
<p>Uncertainty in the standards for an application review can drive delays. A federal agency recently indicated that it may deviate from the longstanding approach to evaluating competitive effects of a merger using a deposit-based analysis. While this analysis could be retained as an initial screen, that agency would "evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger in a manner that is most relevant to each transaction," and "may consider concentrations in any specific products or customer segments&hellip;."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;I imagine bankers contemplating merger transactions will have little capacity to evaluate whether a merger would raise regulatory issues in advance under this open-ended standard.</p>
<p>That proposal also includes revisions to the convenience and needs analysis that may frustrate banks' ability not only to receive regulatory approval, but to manage their businesses going forward. Specifically, the proposal notes that applicants should be "prepared to make commitments regarding future retail banking services in the community to be served for at least three years following consummation of the merger."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;The proposal also suggests that the resulting bank would be expected to "better" meet the convenience and needs of the community to be served than it would absent the merger.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;As is the current expectation, a bank should expect to provide information on their plans for activities and branches as part of the application process. But we should acknowledge that those plans may change over time as conditions evolve. A bank's future activities, whether banking or branching, are subject to regulatory requirements, and oversight through ongoing supervision activities. We need not operate like the applications process is the only tool available to address policy concerns. I expect this proposal would greatly benefit from public input.</p>
<p>Even reported data on current merger processing times may understate the broader application processing timeline. This process often includes preliminary discussions and pre-filings with regulators, and delays between the time an application is filed and when it is "accepted" by the regulator triggering the regulatory processing clock.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Finally, the M&amp;A process can be inappropriately influenced when regulators make demands on firms that are not squarely grounded in statutory approval requirements or based on safety and soundness considerations. During the application deliberation process, regulators can impose limitations or restrictions to address specific supervisory or policy concerns in the form of "conditions" or "commitments" on the approval. While this can be an important tool, it should not be used to replace rulemaking or existing regulations and statutes that guide regulatory action; we should not engage in "regulation by application." Conditions or commitments that impose obligations that are inconsistent with our existing regulatory framework raise issues of significant concern.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;In these circumstances, our existing rules and regulations are the most appropriate and effective tools to address concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Policymakers continue to play an important role in shaping the future of the banking system, not only through policy choices on substantive regulations and supervisory approaches, but also through their role in bank formations, mergers, and acquisitions. We currently have a dynamic banking system, but these individual pieces of the bank regulatory framework do not function independently. The policy choices embodied in current regulation and supervision, and in proposed reforms, aggregate to influence the future of the banking system, often in ways that are unpredictable, and at times in ways that are in conflict and internally inconsistent.</p>
<p>I hope that today's discussions provide an opportunity to have frank conversations about the dynamics shaping the future of the banking system. And throughout, that we identify opportunities to rationalize regulatory approaches, and ensure that the values regulators say they support&mdash;like the importance of a broad and diverse banking system that includes institutions of all sizes serving all of the different market segments across the country&mdash;are consistent with regulatory actions.</p>
<p>I am concerned that many of these actions may actually undermine the long-term viability of banks. I look forward to hearing the insights of all of our participants today, and thinking more deeply about how regulation, supervision, and ongoing reform efforts can help to positively influence a banking system that will effectively and efficiently serve communities of all sizes, consumers, businesses, and the broader U.S. economy long into the future.</p>

<div> outlook, interest rate, farmland values, investment, government policy<br />
Summary:<br />
Farmers' outlook improved, with expectations for interest rate changes and rising farmland values. Optimism in investment but concerns about policy changes. <div>
<p>U.S. farmers' outlook improved in March as the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4130770-1&amp;h=974163770&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a></span>&nbsp;index increased to 114, marking a 3-point rise from February. While the Index of Current Conditions fell by 2 points to 101, the Index of Future Expectations climbed to 120, up by 5 points from February. The disparity between current and future indexes was primarily influenced by farmers' perceptions of a financial downturn taking place in the past year, coupled with some expectations for improvement over the next 12 months. The March survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 11-15, 2024</span>.</p>
<p>"Producers' expectations for interest rate changes have shifted, which could help explain why producers look for financial conditions to improve," said&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4130770-1&amp;h=4012718913&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a></span>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4130770-1&amp;h=2920041404&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</span></p>
<p>This month 48% of respondents said they expect a decline in the U.S. prime interest rate over the next year, up from 35% in December. Just one-third (32%) foresee an increase, compared to 43% last month. Only 20% of respondents this month identified the risk of rising interest rates as a primary concern, a decrease from the 24% recorded&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">December 2023</span>. High input costs continue to be producers' No. 1 concern, with 36% of respondents expressing worry.</p>
<p>The Farm Capital Investment Index increased by 7 points this month, indicating growing optimism among producers about making large investments. Producers who said it is a good time for a large investment rose to 15%, up 11% from the start of the year. This optimism is fueled by producers who pointed to strong cash flows on their farms, coupled with higher dealer inventories for farm machinery. However, some producers still feel hesitant to invest due to concerns about high costs for machinery and construction and high interest rates.</p>
<p>Producers displayed a more optimistic short-term outlook on farmland values in March, with the Short-Term Farmland Values Index rising to 124, a 9-point increase from the previous month. This month, 38% of producers expect farmland values to increase in the coming year, compared to 31% in January and February.</p>
<p>"Factors contributing to this optimism included non-farm investor demand, inflation expectations and strong cash flows. An improved interest rate outlook might have been a factor as well, although producers didn't point to that explicitly in this month's survey," Mintert said.</p>
<p>More farmers this month (24%) said they believe farmland prices will go up because of inflation expectations compared to last month (18%). There was also a slight increase in producers citing strong cash flows (8% in March versus 6% in February) as a reason, and a modest decline in the number of producers who mentioned non-farm investor demand as a major factor influencing the farmland market. However, despite this decline, 57% of producers still consider non-farm investor demand the primary reason for their bullish outlook on farmland values.</p>
<p>Interest in using farmland for carbon sequestration or solar energy production appears to be increasing. In this month's survey, nearly 1 out of 5 respondents (18%) said they or their landowners had been approached about carbon capture utilization and storage on their farmland. Additionally, 12% of this month's respondents said they had discussions with companies interested in leasing farmland for a solar energy project in the last six months, compared to 10% in February. When it comes to long-term farmland lease rates offered by solar energy companies, 54% of respondents this month said they were offered&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1,000</span>&nbsp;or more per acre, while just over one-fourth (27%) were offered&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1,250</span>&nbsp;or more per acre.</p>
<p>The March barometer also revealed that many farmers are concerned about potential government policy changes affecting their farms following this year's elections. Forty-three percent of respondents anticipate more restrictive regulations for agriculture. Additionally, 4 out of 10 (39%) producers expect taxes impacting agriculture to rise.</p>

<title>Quant Enriches Its Central Bank-Grade Blockchain Platform For Enterprise IT And Developers</title>

<div> Blockchain, Overledger, enterprise, pricing plans, interoperable<br />
<br />
Summary: Quant has launched new pricing plans for Overledger, making it available for free and offering two new SaaS plans. Overledger also comes with powerful new enhancements. <div>
<p>Quant, the blockchain for finance pioneer, today launched new pricing plans and functionality aimed at enterprise IT users and developers tasked by their business lines with implementing blockchain technology as part of their organisation&rsquo;s wider digital asset strategy. The Overledger blockchain platform updates are designed to empower enterprise project teams, architects and developers from any sector or size to test, build and deploy on the same interoperable distributed ledger technology already trusted by central banks, commercial banks and large corporates to accelerate their digital asset strategy.</p>
<p>For the first time, Overledger is now available via a fully functional, time-unlimited free plan to allow institutions to easily adopt a technology which is rapidly growing in adoption while creating new revenue streams, making complex workflows more efficient, reducing legacy costs and enabling access to new markets and clients. The new plan is the most powerful free blockchain plan available for any enterprise looking to execute their digital asset strategy; it enables IT end-users and developers to fully test their concepts, build business applications, connect their existing systems and tokenise then launch interoperable digital assets of any type.</p>
<p>For those that want to start deploying on a mainnet blockchain or run more complex proofs of concept or projects with multiple counterparties and networks, Overledger offers two new, self-serve SaaS plans at $179 and $379 per month respectively. These new Overledger plans - unlike blockchain infrastructure products that are aimed solely for node hosting or siloed dApp development, aren&rsquo;t capable of serving regulated financial institutions and central banks, provide limited functionality, and charge by transaction or volume &ndash; are available for just a flat monthly fee, giving customers clarity on their costs and IT budgets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that anyone who wants to build a business in the blockchain economy should be able to do so using technology that has been tried and tested in the most demanding of use cases: regulated financial services,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>says Gilbert Verdian, Founder and CEO</b>. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why these new plans and features meet the demands of IT decision makers: they&rsquo;re an accelerated go-to-market for enterprise IT and developers to choose the best technology and delivery solutions for their business lines at speed &ndash; using the same &lsquo;grown up&rsquo; tech already used by institutions like central banks and their commercial counterparts, securities issuers, and asset managers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Natasha Boyton-West, Head of Product &ndash; Platform, says</b>: &ldquo;Until now, businesses have struggled to capitalise on the benefits of blockchain because it&rsquo;s a complex technology requiring specialist skills and different blockchains are not interoperable with one another. Overledger changes all that. It&rsquo;s easy to use, continually enhanced, and integrates seamlessly with your existing systems and new networks alike. That&rsquo;s how it makes blockchain simple, trusted, and future-proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As before, bespoke enterprise plans - backed by comprehensive service level agreements, dedicated infrastructure and all the specialist expertise of the Quant team - are also available for clients that are ready to put their blockchain solutions into mainstream production.</p>
<p>Overledger now comes with powerful new enhancements across the board too, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blockchain platform as a service:</b>&nbsp;A simple way for users to run their own dedicated blockchain testing environment with complete security and privacy.</li>
<li><b>Smart contract API:</b>&nbsp;Users can now deploy and launch any smart contract on any chain with ease.</li>
<li><b>Transaction signing:</b>&nbsp;There is no need to set up key management solutions to sign test transactions; it&rsquo;s now built-in at platform level.</li>
<li><b>Secure transactions:&nbsp;</b>All transactions are co-signed with an additional level of security expected by enterprise security.</li>
<li><b>Agents:</b>&nbsp;Both Make and Zapier integrations are available for Overledger, enabling powerful code-free automation with any blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<div> AIMO, Kaggle, AI model, mathematics, progress prize
<br />
Summary: 
XTX Markets is offering a $1.048 million progress prize for the AIMO on Kaggle to develop AI models for mathematical reasoning. Dr. Geoff Smith is delighted. 
<br /> <div>
<p>XTX Markets is excited to announce the opening of the first $1.048 million progress prize for the Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO), on the Kaggle platform.</p>
<p>This initiative is part of the $10 million AIMO Prize, launched in November 2023, aimed at fostering the development of AI models capable of mathematical reasoning. The ultimate goal is to create a publicly shared AI model that could achieve a gold medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).</p>
<p>The grand prize of $5 million will be awarded to the first AI model that competes in an AIMO Prize-approved competition and attains a performance equivalent to an IMO gold medal.</p>
<p>To encourage continuous progress towards this goal, XTX Markets has introduced a series of progress prizes.</p>
<p>This first progress prize includes problems at intermediate-level high school mathematics competitions, but do not reach IMO difficulty. It is open from 1 April to 27 June, with the prizes to be distributed to up to five teams in July 2024 at the 65th IMO in Bath, UK.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Progress Prize Details</span>:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>$1.048 million prize pool.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;Kaggle platform's private leaderboard will determine the distribution of $253,952 among the top five teams, based on minimum performance criteria.</li>
<li>Remainder of the pool will go to the first team scoring at least 47/50 on both public and private leaderboards. If not won, it will roll over to the next year's prize pool.</li>

Summary:
ASDA and Worldline extend their partnership for an omnichannel payment solution to enhance customer experience, gain insights, and optimize costs. <div>
<p><span>Worldline (Euronext: WLN), a global leader in payment services, announces the extension of its 16-year partnership with ASDA, the UK&rsquo;s third-largest supermarket group, to deliver a full omnichannel payment solution, for an initial period of five years.</span></p>
<p>As the UK witnesses a significant surge in online food and grocery shopping &ndash; projected to rise from &pound;25.3 billion in 2022 to &pound;29.3 billion in 2025 (Statista) &ndash; ASDA is strategically investing in enhancing the user experience for its 18 million weekly customers.</p>
<p>To ensure a seamless payment experience for ASDA&rsquo;s customers, the entire payment process chain is consolidated under Worldline as a single provider. ASDA integrates Worldline's omnichannel payment solution, including terminals, acquiring services, and smart routing through Worldline Payment Orchestration, to enhance the customer experience and operational efficiency for approximately 800,000 weekly deliveries.</p>
<p>By collaborating with Worldline, ASDA anticipates gaining valuable insights about their customers, empowering them to tailor their offerings to better meet evolving needs. This partnership is expected to significantly increase transactions through Worldline&rsquo;s payment gateway. Among these transactions, the majority will occur in-store, complemented by a substantial number of online purchases.</p>
<p>Worldline's solution is designed to ensure stable acceptance and high-quality standards both in-store and online, with end-to-end capabilities covering gateway and hardware. This full omnichannel solution will enable ASDA to offer a seamless user experience to its customers across all channels.</p>
<p>By introducing Worldline&rsquo;s Smart Routing, ASDA gains control over their card acquiring flows, enabling them to choose the most suitable acquirer for each transaction. This enhances resilience and customer experience while optimising costs by selecting the most cost-efficient options among acquiring partners.</p>
<blockquote><span>Lee Jones, Chief Executive Officer, Worldline Merchant Services UK</span>, commented: "<i>Extending our partnership with ASDA is a tremendous boost and an honour for Worldline, particularly in the retail grocery sector. By continuing to place their trust in us and utilising the full range of services we offer, ASDA is demonstrating that our payment solution is not only a market leader but also ideally suited to meet the needs of large grocery retailers.</i>"</blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Richard Sykes, Treasurer &amp; Head of Pensions, ASDA&nbsp;</span>added: &ldquo;<i>Our partnership with Worldline will help create significant operational efficiencies throughout our customer relationship journey, and as customer shopping habits change, the insight, data and learning through Worldline&rsquo;s platform and value-added services will enable ASDA to be more relevant to its customers.

<div> mentors, career achievement award, social equity, civil rights movement, diversity initiative<br />
<br />
Acceptance of career achievement award from Duke University's Cook Center on Social Equity, emphasizes the importance of mentors, civil rights movement, and ongoing commitment to justice and opportunity.<br />
Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Dr. Darity, for your kind introduction. I am profoundly moved to be surrounded by family and friends, and it gives me another opportunity to tell all of you that I would not be where I am today without your support. I include in that circle my fellow award recipients today, Drs. Cecilia Rouse and Peter Blair Henry.</p>
<p>I am beyond humbled and honored to receive this career achievement award from The Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity at Duke University, and I am inspired by what it represents. Of course, to me, Samuel DuBois Cook was simply "Uncle Sam." My Uncle Sam was a Korean War veteran, a political theorist, an activist, and the first African American tenured professor at Duke and any major southern university. He then went on to become president of Dillard University . . . the list goes on and on. Now that was a lifetime of achievement.</p>
<p>At Morehouse College, Uncle Sam was a classmate of a young man named Martin Luther King, Jr. Before that, they picked tobacco together during the summer to earn the money they needed for their studies. Uncle Sam led the campus chapter of the NAACP at Morehouse and went on to become student body president (twice) and valedictorian. Along with my mother Mary Murray Cook, his brother and my dad Rev. Payton Brailsford Cook, my cousin and civil rights leader Floyd McKissick, Sr., and a host of other relatives, he instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better. When I was beaten and suffered verbal assaults while desegregating my schools in Georgia, I drew strength from the example set by my uncle, my aunts, my parents, and by Dr. King and their conviction that there is great hope and promise in the world. It was&mdash;and remains&mdash;the duty of everyone in and who embraced and was inspired by the Civil Rights Movement to make good on that hope and promise and to build a better future.</p>
<p>I mentioned great effort. That was always paramount for my Uncle Sam.&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;quoted his advice: "Have a vision&mdash;a dream of success&mdash;and work like hell."</p>
<p>Uncle Sam believed people need guides, role models, and taskmasters to take advantage of the greater opportunities he helped to make possible. We call those guides, role models, and taskmasters "mentors" for short.</p>
<p>I found many mentors along my academic journey, and I would like to give special thanks to those I met through the Diversity Initiative for Tenure in Economics, which Sandy Darity started at Duke in 2008. The Initiative is a research mentoring workshop that pairs junior faculty with mentors who can help them navigate the path to tenure. It has seen 53 Initiative fellows being promoted and tenured at institutions of higher learning.</p>
<p>I am grateful to all the mentors who took my ideas seriously, including Art Goldsmith who was a DITE mentor, helped me sharpen the hypotheses that emerged from them, and pressed me to think hard about the best data and methods to test these hypotheses. Graduate and undergraduate students from many backgrounds ask me how to find mentors that share their background. I tell them they will need more than one mentor and to seek out mentors who have different backgrounds and expertise such that they will be exposed to a wide range of views and experiences. For just one paper on violence and patents, I had several mentors, among them George Akerlof, Ken Arrow, Sandy Darity, Barry Eichengreen, Milton Friedman, Alan Krueger, Paul Romer, and Jeff Wooldridge. Most importantly, make sure your mentors challenge you and hold you accountable. And when the time comes, it is incumbent on you&mdash;on all of us, really&mdash;to become a mentor. That is what Uncle Sam did. That is one reason I was grateful to lead the American Economic Association's Summer Program, to receive the AEA Mentoring Program's Impactful Mentor award for working with graduate students, and to participate in and support other initiatives to train young economists. Mentors help convert hope and promise into action, enabling those who come after us to build a better future. As I learned from Uncle Sam, there is no higher calling.</p>
<p>In closing, let me express my hope that accepting this career achievement award does not mean I am officially retired. But more seriously, I am very grateful to be recognized and in the company of colleagues who have stood by me and fought with me to improve our field. I accept this award in the spirit of challenge it represents. I am forever mindful of Samuel DuBois Cook's belief that there is much work ahead of us as we seek to build a world that is more just and offers more opportunity for all. Although this may be called a career achievement award, I accept it with the conviction that I am just getting started.</p>

The Federal Reserve Board is accepting applications for the Community Advisory Council, which advises on consumer and community issues. Members meet semiannually with the Board. 
Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board announced on Monday that it is accepting applications from individuals who wish to be considered for membership on the Community Advisory Council (CAC). The CAC was formed in 2015. It advises the Board on issues affecting consumers and communities and complements two of the Board's other advisory councils whose members represent depository institutions--the Federal Advisory Council and the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council.</p>
<p>The CAC is made up of a diverse group of experts and representatives of consumer and community development organizations and interests, including affordable housing, community and workforce development, small business, and asset and wealth building. CAC members meet semiannually with members of the Board of Governors in Washington to provide a range of perspectives on the economic circumstances and financial services needs of consumers and communities, with a particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income consumers and communities.</p>
<p>The Board expects to announce the appointment of CAC members in the fall of 2024. Applicants from previous years are encouraged to re-apply in 2024. Additional information about the selection process, including instructions for submitting an application, can be found in the attached&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>&nbsp;Notice.</p>

<p><span>ISDA has drafted a response to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) consultation on Post-trade Risk Reduction (PTRR). &nbsp;PTRR Services optimize bilateral and cleared derivatives portfolios to minimize the build-up of notional amounts and trade count, counterparty risk, and basis risk respectively, which in turn reduces systemic risk. &nbsp;ISDA is broadly supportive of the IOSCO proposed sound guidance.</span></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Trading Up To A 25% More Expensive Home Would More Than Double The Average Mortgage Holder’s Payment</title>

<div> mortgage, home prices, inventory, interest rates, lock-in effect
Summary:<br />Inventory levels have improved slightly. Home sales are rising with lower interest rates. Lock-in effect on existing mortgages is keeping inventory low. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>From 2000 to 2022, upgrading to a 25% more expensive home would have required the average homeowner to increase their principal and interest payment by roughly 40%, or about $400 per month</li>
<li>Today, that same trade-up buyer&rsquo;s payment would increase by an average of $1,384 per month, a 103% jump that highlights the real-world pressures keeping current mortgage holders &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to their homes</li>
<li>Simply giving up their current rate to move across the street to an equivalently priced home in today&rsquo;s market would result in a nearly 40% increase in P&amp;I &ndash; roughly as much as the historical trade-up cost</li>
<li>Homeowners who took out mortgages when rates were near record lows in 2020 and 2021 face an even steeper &ldquo;move across the street&rdquo; cost, with such a lateral move requiring a 60% higher monthly payment</li>
<li>Trading up for these borrowers &ndash; who account for two out of every five active mortgages &ndash; would take a 132% increase in monthly P&amp;I</li>
<li>The trade-up cost &ndash; and the associated lock-in effect &ndash; varies significantly across geographies, from a 72% payment increase on the low end in Buffalo to more than 140% in Los Angeles and San Jose</li>
<li>Inventory remains constricted, but improved, as 65% of major U.S. markets have more homes available for sale today than at this time last year</li>
<li>Lower interest rates in late Q4 and early Q1 led to home sales in February hitting their highest adjusted level since March 2023</li>
<li>The February ICE Home Price Index showed strength in the market, with adjusted home prices rising by +0.43%, up from +0.33% in January, which is equivalent to a +5.3% seasonally adjusted annualized rate</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">April 2024 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>There are many headwinds facing the would-be seller in today&rsquo;s market, making their existing mortgage payment particularly attractive in comparison. While this has been the case for some time, according to Andy Walden, Vice President of Enterprise Research Strategy, the ICE Research and Analysis team sought to quantify this "lock-in effect" beyond simply identifying the number of borrowers within or below a given interest rate band.</p>
<p>"After American mortgage holders secured some of the lowest first lien rates ever and benefited from record home price growth on top of that, we wanted to quantify just how locked-in folks truly are and what kind of rate declines would be needed to shake some of that inventory loose," said Walden. "Leveraging the ICE Home Price Index and our loan level mortgage data, we looked at how much it would cost the average homeowner with a mortgage to trade up to a 25% more expensive home in today's market &ndash; or to simply move across the street, for that matter, into a home identical to their own. The results were bracing, to say the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That average homeowner&rsquo;s mortgage payment would more than double, to gain just 25% in property value &ndash; hardly an entertaining proposition. That said, you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a more vivid illustration of the lock-in effect that&rsquo;s kept for sale inventory in a hole for the last few years. Simply giving up their current rate to move across the street to an equivalently priced home in today&rsquo;s market would result in a nearly 40% increase in P&amp;I, an average of $500 more per month. Lower rates would ease the calculation for many and make moves more reasonable. But the net result continues to be too few homes for too many buyers. Until that fundamental mismatch is addressed, simple supply and demand will continue to press on both inventory and affordability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though inventory remains constricted, there have been some signs of improvement. While still lagging 40% below pre-pandemic averages, February&rsquo;s inventory deficit was the shallowest of any February since 2020. Inventory levels rose in 60 of the 100 largest U.S. markets in the month, with 65% of major markets having more homes available for sale today than they did at the same time last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After closing out 2023 at an 11-year low, home sales have begun to improve over the last two months,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;In fact, lower interest rates in late Q4 and early Q1 led to February home sales hitting their highest adjusted level since March 2023. With sales rising, and inventory still tight, months of supply edged slightly lower in February, continuing to provide a floor for home prices. Our February ICE Home Price Index showed strength in that regard, with adjusted home prices rising by +0.43%, up from +0.33% in January, which is equivalent to a +5.3% seasonally adjusted annualized rate. Keep in mind that SAAR had fallen below 1% as recently as five months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lock-in effect on inventory varies significantly across geographies, with the cost to give up an existing mortgage and buy a 25% more expensive home ranging from a low of a 72% payment increase in Buffalo, N.Y., to more than 140% in Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif. While home prices and mortgage amounts are certainly a factor in that increased cost, the effect is compounded by the fact that borrowers in more expensive cities tend to have both lower mortgage rates and higher unpaid balances on their existing homes. Because of this, the lock-in effect on inventories may be strongest in more expensive California markets such as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose &ndash; markets that also face challenges in terms of new construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortgage rates need to come down to dislodge the lock-in effect,&rdquo; Walden concluded. &ldquo;Since most factors influencing 30-year rates are out of lenders&rsquo; control, they need to be able to find ways to compress spreads without simultaneously compressing their own profit margins. That&rsquo;s key to our mission at ICE &ndash; identifying and eliminating inefficiencies in housing finance through technology, while finding smarter, faster, cheaper and more transparent ways to originate loans and increase liquidity."</p>

<title>Global Regulators to Meet Today As Climate Change Impacts Timekeeping Systems</title>

<div> regulators, transaction reporting, Earth's rotation, timekeeping systems, UTC adjustment
Summary:<br />The financial regulators are evaluating if regulations on transaction reporting and clock synchronization need revisions due to Earth's rotation impact on UTC. Concerns arise over possible market abuse judgments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Major financial regulators are set to hold an urgent virtual meeting today, April 1, to evaluate if existing regulations on transaction reporting, order record-keeping, and clock synchronisation need revisions in light of climate change's impacts on Earth's rotation and timekeeping systems.</p>
<p>Trading venues and participants must align their business clocks with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to the millisecond or finer for recording reportable events. This synchronisation is crucial for accuracy in timestamping events sent to the central repository.</p>
<p>Recent scientific findings highlight global warming's significant effect on Earth's rotation speed, necessitating periodic adjustments to UTC. These adjustments ensure atomic clocks, which are far more precise, remain in sync with the slight variations in Earth's rotation and prevent the discrepancy in day length from increasing.</p>
<p>A recent study in the journal Nature attributes the accelerating melting of polar ice due to human activities as a new contributing factor to these distortions, effectively slowing Earth's spin and impacting our timekeeping adjustments.</p>
<p>Historically, to match the day's length with atomic time, leap seconds were added when Earth's rotation lagged behind caesium clocks. For instance, in 1972, the "rotation day" extended 0.025 seconds longer than the "atomic day", leading to a cumulative 0.7 seconds delay over a year. This delay was corrected by incorporating an extra second at the year's end. Such adjustments were standard until recent shifts in Earth's interior began to speed up its rotation, suggesting the possible need to subtract a leap second in 2026 for the first time.</p>
<p>This potential change in UTC adjustment raises concerns among regulators about the implications for market abuse judgments, which legal experts could challenge.</p>
<p>Avril Feuilherade, spokesperson for the Council of Regulators, emphasised, "Timing is everything."</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Requires Regulatory Clearance On The Appointment Of Mr. Cao Shixuan, Former Director Of ecoWise Holdings Limited</title>

<div> audit, transactions, non-compliance, SGX RegCo, EY

Summary:
SGX RegCo directed ecoWise to commission audits and appointed special auditor EY. EY's report highlighted transactions concerns, non-compliance, and actions to be taken. SGX RegCo will require ecoWise to provide a satisfactory trading resumption proposal and will investigate potential listing rule breaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) refers to the Notice of Compliance issued to ecoWise Holdings Limited on 25 June 2021 and the company&rsquo;s announcement dated 28 March 2024 on the findings of the special audit by the special auditor, Ernst &amp; Young Advisory Pte Ltd (&ldquo;EY&rdquo;). EY reports the findings directly to SGX RegCo and the company&rsquo;s relevant sponsors during the relevant period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Background&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On 14 June 2021, the company announced the group&rsquo;s financial results for the half-year ended 30 April 2021 (&ldquo;1HFY2021 Results&rdquo;). The announcement indicated that the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, Mr. Lee Thiam Seng (&ldquo;Mr. Lee&rdquo;) did not agree to the release of the 1HFY2021 Results and therefore, did not provide his confirmation on the accuracy of the financial statements as required under the Listing Rules. SGX RegCo queried the company on the announcement on the same day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 June 2021, the company requested for a trading halt (which was subsequently converted into a trading suspension) as the directors could not unanimously agree and finalise their response to SGX RegCo. The company subsequently announced on 25 June 2021, among others, that Mr. Lee had concerns over certain transactions and their impact on the group&rsquo;s 1HFY2021 Results due to insufficient information provided to him by the finance team.</p>
<p>In light of the above developments, SGX RegCo directed the company, among others, to (i) commission its statutory auditor from RSM Chio Lim LLP (&ldquo;RSM Chio Lim&rdquo;) to perform an audit of its 1HFY2021 Results and (ii) appoint a suitable independent special auditor to look into the transactions raised by Mr. Lee, and the corporate governance of the group. EY was appointed as the special auditor on 27 August 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RSM Chio Lim&rsquo;s audit findings suggested that the group had PRC-incorporated subsidiaries that were not consolidated with the group and there were transactions between the group and an entity called Hong Kong Chen Bang Investments Ltd (&ldquo;HK Chen Bang&rdquo;), purportedly associated with the Group&rsquo;s former Executive Director and Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Cao Shixuan (&ldquo;Mr. Cao&rdquo;). EY was therefore directed by SGX RegCo to expand the scope of the special audit to include transactions undertaken by the unconsolidated entities as well as with HK Chen Bang (the &ldquo;Expanded Scope&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span>Findings from EY&rsquo;s Special Audit Report</span></p>
<p><span>Transactions raised by Mr. Lee</span></p>
<p>The transactions which Mr. Lee had concerns on were: (a) arbitration with China Hua Dian Engineering Co., Ltd, (b) liquidation of China-UK Low Carbon Enterprise Co., Ltd, an entity which the company had an indirect 20% equity interest in, and (c) disposal of Saiko Rubber (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and the use of disposal proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EY did not observe any irregularities in these transactions, aside from the non-disclosure of key milestones relating to the arbitration with China Hua Dian. Certain key matters of these transactions were either not reported to the board of directors, or updates to the board of directors were unclear or inaccurate. EY further observed that ecoWise&rsquo;s board apparently relied on the former sponsors to advise on matters that require announcements. However, as the former sponsors were not always made aware of developments within the company, they were unable to advise the company accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Transactions under the Expanded Scope</span></p>
<p>The transactions covered under the Expanded Scope included the review of the transactions undertaken by the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries and the group&rsquo;s transactions with HK Chen Bang which took place primarily in PRC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Available documents showed that Mr. Cao was the legal representative and/or the executive director of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries, and his role was to oversee the Company&rsquo;s operations in the PRC. The transactions under the Expanded Scope were primarily handled by Mr. Cao. EY reported that they were unable to obtain clarity on those transactions due to the lack of comprehensive records maintained by the group and Mr. Cao also did not accede to EY&rsquo;s request for information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Instances of non-compliance&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>EY reported certain key controls lapses, such as when payment amounts were split to circumvent the existing payment approval matrix to supposedly expedite the payment process, record keeping on payments was poor, lack of policies on matters that require company announcement, and matters that should be escalated to the board of directors.</p>
<p>EY also highlighted potential listing rule breaches relating to the non-disclosure of the group&rsquo;s ongoing arbitration with China Hua Dian and the existence of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries, internal control lapses, as well as potential contravention of Section 160 of the Companies Act in relation to the failure to obtain company&rsquo;s approval for the disposal of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Actions by SGX RegCo</span></p>
<p>Mr. Cao was involved in the transactions under the Expanded Scope and did not attend the interviews arranged by EY. He also failed to provide further information to EY on the transactions, when requested. Consequently, EY was unable to conduct a thorough examination of the transactions. In light of his failure to extend cooperation, Mr. Cao will be placed on our Directors&rsquo; and Executive Officers&rsquo; Watchlist. Issuers who intend to appoint him must seek the views and guidance of SGX RegCo before any proposed appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will require ecoWise to provide a satisfactory trading resumption proposal that include, among others, the following: (a) a clean audit opinion for the latest set of financial statements, (b) a viable and sustainable business, (c) demonstration of its ability to operate as a going concern, (d) assessment and confirmations by the Board and sponsor on the adequacy of working capital for at least 12 months following trading resumption and (e) an independent attestation on the effectiveness and adequacy of its internal controls, which takes into account EY&rsquo;s recommendations (where still relevant) and its operating environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will investigate the potential listing rule breaches highlighted in the EY Report and refer any potential contraventions of the law to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Launches COSMIC Platform To Strengthen The Financial System’s Defence Against Money Laundering And Terrorism Financing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> launch, COSMIC, financial institutions, money laundering, terrorism financing<br />
Summary:<br />
MAS launched COSMIC, a platform for FIs to share customer info to combat financial crimes. Collaboration with major banks to safeguard against criminal behavior. <div>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today launched COSMIC&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-launches-cosmic-platform#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;, the first centralised digital platform to facilitate sharing of customer information among financial institutions (FIs) to combat money laundering (ML), terrorism financing (TF) and proliferation financing (PF)&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-launches-cosmic-platform#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;globally. The Financial Services and Markets (Amendment) Act 2023 and accompanying subsidiary legislation, which set out the legal basis and safeguards for such sharing, commenced on the same day.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Following public consultation in October 2021, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (FSMA) was amended in May 2023 to set out the legislative framework for COSMIC. A COSMIC participant FI may share customer information with another participant FI only if the customer&rsquo;s profile or behaviour displays certain objectively-defined indicators of suspicion, or &ldquo;red flags&rdquo;. The FSMA requires participant FIs to have in place policies and operational safeguards to protect the confidentiality of information shared. This will allow participant FIs to share information on potential criminal behaviour while safeguarding the interests of the vast majority of customers who are legitimate. Customers are encouraged to continue to provide timely responses if requested by FIs to provide clarifications on their risk profiles or transactions, so that FIs can make informed risk assessments.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>COSMIC was co-developed by MAS and six major commercial banks in Singapore - DBS, OCBC, UOB, Citibank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank. These banks will be the participant FIs on COSMIC during its initial phase. Information sharing is currently voluntary and focused on three key financial crime risks in commercial banking, namely: (a) misuse of legal persons; (b) misuse of trade finance for illicit purposes; and (c) proliferation financing.</p>
<p>4<span> </span>Ms Loo Siew Yee, Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments &amp; Financial Crime), MAS, said, &ldquo;COSMIC will enable FIs to warn each other of suspicious activities and make more informed risk assessments on a timely basis. It complements the industry&rsquo;s existing close collaboration with MAS and law enforcement authorities to combat financial crime. This will strengthen Singapore&rsquo;s capabilities to uphold our reputation as a well-regulated and trusted financial centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>***</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Saudi Exchange has hit a milestone of 400 listed securities</li>
<li>In 2023, IPOs on the Saudi Exchange accounted for over 70% of GCC IPOs, with a robust pipeline supporting the Exchange&rsquo;s accelerated growth to become one of the top 10 largest exchanges globally according to the World Federation of Exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Saudi Exchange has welcomed its 400th listing across all securities. This achievement highlights the Exchange&rsquo;s pivotal role in the Kingdom&rsquo;s economy, underpinned by robust international investor interest and a diverse range of securities within a highly dynamic market landscape.</p>
<p>Since its establishment 16 years ago, the Saudi Exchange has quickly grown to become one of the top ten largest in the world, the third largest amongst emerging market peers, and the largest exchange in the MENA region. The Saudi Exchange also consistently ranks in the top ten exchanges globally for IPO proceeds and accounted for over 70% of GCC IPOs in 2023. With a substantial SAR 11.9 billion ($3.2 billion) raised through IPOs on the Main Market in 2023, the Saudi Exchange has firmly established itself as a significant contributor to the global IPO landscape, a key driver of its continued growth in scope and scale. In 2023, furthermore, the Tadawul All Share Index grew by 14.2%, outpacing the 9.8% growth of the benchmark MSCI Emerging Market Index.</p>
<p>With a commitment to offering a broad spectrum of financial instruments, the Saudi Exchange has successfully cultivated a diverse portfolio. As of March 27th 2024, the Saudi Exchange has 216 securities listed on the Main Market, 83 on the Nomu &ndash; Parallel Market, 71 Sukuk &amp; Bonds, 19 REITs, 9 ETFs and 2 CEFs.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Nasser Al Ajaji, Chief of Listing, said, &ldquo;The 400th listed security on the Saudi Exchange marks a significant milestone and is a clear testament to the Kingdom's dynamic capital market and its growing appeal to investors globally. In only 16 years, the Saudi Exchange has grown rapidly to rank among the top ten stock exchanges in the world. These achievements are more than just a number; they are symbolic of the economic diversity and growth spurred by Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the Financial Sector Development Program, and the support of the CMA to accelerate the IPO pipeline. All of this reflects the potential we are poised to realize."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Saudi Exchange is dedicated to enhancing the Kingdom&rsquo;s capital market infrastructure, diversifying product and service offerings, and continuing to provide opportunities that support the economic ambitions of Saudi Arabia and its participants.</p>
