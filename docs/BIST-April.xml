<div> New Zealand Super Fund, Chief investment officer, CalPERS, Retirement benefits, Sustainable Investments <br />
Summary:<br />Stephen Gilmore appointed as CalPERS chief investment officer. Overseen New Zealand Super Fund, Australia's sovereign wealth fund, and global investment positions. Annual salary $718,750. <div>
<p>The California Public Employees' Retirement System has selected Stephen Gilmore, a senior investment leader with extensive experience in public and private financial institutions and across cultures and geographies, as the pension fund's chief investment officer.</p>
<p>His appointment is expected to become effective in July.</p>
<p>Gilmore, an internationally recognized investment leader whose career has spanned 40 years, comes to CalPERS after more than five years as the chief investment officer of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZ Super Fund), a sovereign wealth fund owned by the New Zealand government and valued at more than $73 billion (NZD).</p>
<p>"Stephen has worked in very public roles during his career for organizations where transparency and resiliency are essential," said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. "He brings not only a wealth of investing knowledge to the job, but he also has the temperament to understand the needs of our members and public sector employers who depend on CalPERS to be a steady, long-term partner."</p>
<p>As chief investment officer for NZ Super Fund since 2019, Gilmore has overseen the world's best-performing sovereign fund, with annual investment returns of more than 12% a year over the past decade.</p>
<p>"Stephen brings an unmatched knowledge of global investing and managing diverse and high-performing investment professionals," said CalPERS President Theresa Taylor. "We conducted an exhaustive, worldwide search for a deeply skilled leader to continue our mission of providing retirement benefits to California's public sector workers, and we are confident Stephen is the right person for the job."</p>
<p>Gilmore was chief investment strategist of the Future Fund, Australia's sovereign wealth fund. There, he oversaw efforts such as portfolio strategy, portfolio overlays, and investment risk. He has also held senior international positions with AIG Financial Products and Morgan Stanley, as well as assignments with the International Monetary Fund and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful to CalPERS' leaders for the trust they've put in me to help shape the pension fund's next chapter," Gilmore said. "There are high expectations, and rightly so, when it comes to fulfilling the promises made in serving those who serve California."</p>
<p>Gilmore succeeds Nicole Musicco, who left CalPERS last September. As chief investment officer, he will oversee a team of more than 300 investment professionals and a portfolio valued at $494.6 billion. His arrival comes shortly after the launch of a sweeping Sustainable Investments 2030 plan, which includes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/newsroom/calpers-news/2023/calpers-announces-100-billion-net-zero-pledge-and-new-climate-accountability-measures" target="_self">investing $100 billion in climate solutions over the next six years</a>.</p>
<p>The annual salary for the position, not including incentives based on fund performance relative to established benchmarks, is $718,750.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, 1930s Reforms, Trading Rules, Efficient Markets, Best Execution
Summary:
Efficient capital markets, trust, and liquidity benefit from reforms, such as shorter settlement cycles, incentivizing competition, and ensuring best execution. <div>
<p class="paragraph">Thank you, Erik, for that kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Upon passage of the Securities Act of 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress knew their job wasn&rsquo;t done. While they knew the &ldquo;Truth in Securities Act&rdquo; was consequential, Roosevelt and Congress understood it had not yet dealt with key problems in the securities markets.</p>
<p>The 1920s was a time when markets were rife with fraud and manipulation. This led to a fundamental breakdown of trust in the capital markets.</p>
<p>Congress responded with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. They also set up the Securities and Exchange Commission, embedding the word &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; right in our name.</p>
<p>There was much debate about these reforms.</p>
<p>Sam Rayburn, then Chair of the Commerce Committee and later Speaker of the House, said the legislation was being considered &ldquo;under the pressure of the most vicious and persistent lobby that any of us have ever known in Washington.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Congressman Fred Britten, speaking about Rayburn&rsquo;s legislation, argued that &ldquo;the real object of the bill is to Russianize everything.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Given such opposition, naturally the final bill had a series of compromises. At its core, though, it was about enhancing the integrity of and building trust in our capital markets through the oversight of exchanges, broker-dealers, and the trading of securities in secondary markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As Joe Kennedy, the first Chair of the SEC said so eloquently, &ldquo;[T]he community thus exposed to fraud and manipulation should welcome the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commission it created.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>It was four decades later that Congress and President Gerald Ford came back with significant reforms to promote efficiency and competition in the capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Congress was addressing problems related to fixed commissions. They were reacting to the back office &ldquo;Paperwork Crisis&rdquo; of the 1960s. There were issues resulting from emerging technologies. There also were challenges regarding how self-regulatory organizations (SROs) set their rules.</p>
<p>Through the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Congress for the first time gave the SEC authority to establish a National Market System for securities transactions. They gave the SEC authority for a national quoting system for securities. They gave us authority over the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. Further, they gave us new and revised authority regarding review and setting of SRO rules.</p>
<p>Congress found, as articulated in section 11A, that it was in the public interest and for the protection of investors to assure &ldquo;fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Congress inserted the word competition in 20 places in the securities laws.</p>
<p>Two Congresses and two Presidents, Roosevelt and Ford, understood how important our capital markets are to investors, issuers, and more broadly to our economy. They were focused on two key public goods: first, instilling greater trust, and second, instilling greater efficiency and competition in the capital markets.</p>
<p>Promoting trust in the capital markets by reducing fraud and manipulation benefits investors and issuers alike. Such trust means more investors are willing to invest in the markets with confidence. It means issuers can rely on the markets to price their offerings. Well-functioning markets provide price discovery that helps capital flow to its most productive uses.</p>
<p>Efficiency and competition mean the central functioning of the capital markets is less costly, so investors get better returns. Issuers can raise money more efficiently. When market participants know that they can get a competitive price when selling or buying, they are more likely to invest in the primary market in the first place.&nbsp;Moreover, competition and efficiency allow prices to come closest to fundamental value, aiding price discovery and capital formation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efficiency and competition also promote another externality&mdash;greater depth of liquidity in the markets. As they say, liquidity begets liquidity.</p>
<p>Congress understood these public goods could not be achieved by private markets on their own. Private incentives are likely insufficient when it comes to setting rules for the capital markets.&nbsp;Well-functioning markets create positive externalities for the American public that aren&rsquo;t fully internalized by private entities.&nbsp;Leaving it to the private markets alone would lead to under-investment in policies that best promote trust, efficiency, and competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the SEC has an important role to play. The need to promote these public goods is constant. Given everchanging technology and business models, though, we have an obligation to update the rules of the road, always with an eye toward promoting trust as well as efficiency, competition, and liquidity in the markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With the emergence of the internet, under Chair Arthur Levitt, the Commission in 1998 comprehensively defined &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; under SEC rules and adopted a framework for alternative trading systems (ATSs).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Chair Bill Donaldson, the Commission updated the National Market System rules in 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Chair Donaldson said at the time: &ldquo;We are addressing a complex set of problems that have lingered in the marketplace for years, that have caused substantial discord among market participants and that have resulted in inferior outcomes for investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<h3>Clearance and Settlement</h3>
<p><br />In the 1975 reforms, Congress added Section 17A to the Securities Exchange Act and directed the SEC to fulfill an important role overseeing securities clearinghouses. Later, in 1986&mdash;after a dozen nonbank Treasury dealers failed, sending shudders into the banking system&mdash;Congress broadened the SEC&rsquo;s authority to include clearinghouses in the Treasury markets.</p>
<p>Clearinghouses are vital to our capital markets. They facilitate what one might call the market plumbing, that which happens after you execute a transaction through the time that it settles. Standing in the middle of the securities markets, clearinghouses are the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.</p>
<p>A bit of history might surprise everyone, but the U.S. stock market settled at T+1 well into the 1920s. It was only with increasing volumes that the market plumbing was lengthened to a business week after a transaction (T+5).</p>
<p>It took the Stock Market Crash of 1987 before the Commission implemented our first settlement rule in 1995. That&rsquo;s when we shortened the settlement cycle to three business days after the trade date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;We shortened it to two business days after the trade date in 2017.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we adopted rules to shorten it to one business day, which will be implemented on May 28, 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would note our U.S. government securities market has been on a T+1 settlement cycle ever since we started central clearing of U.S. treasuries in 1986. We also have a T+1 settlement cycle in securities options markets, much of the derivatives markets, and as the normal practice for certain mutual funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Thus, on May 28, we&rsquo;re aligning the rest of the U.S. securities markets to T+1. I encourage all market participants to ensure that they are ready for the upcoming transition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also adopted rules in December 2023 to facilitate additional central clearing for the $27 trillion U.S. Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The final rules make changes to enhance customer clearing and broaden the scope of which transactions clearinghouse members must clear. Enhanced access to central clearing can facilitate all-to-all trading, competition, and resiliency in these markets. These rules help fulfill Congress&rsquo;s mandates to promote efficiency, competition, liquidity, and resiliency in the markets.</p>
<h3>Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems</h3>
<p><br />A lot has changed in the capital markets in the 26 years since Chair Levitt&rsquo;s Commission adopted Regulation ATS. Electronification and new methods of trading have advanced significantly. Much of the secondary markets in Treasuries is facilitated by interdealer broker (IDB) electronic platforms. Further, principal-trading firms have been participating to a greater degree, representing approximately 61 percent of the volume in 2019 on the IDB platforms in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The growing importance to investors and the overall market structure of exempted platforms led to the Commission, under Chair Jay Clayton, to put out a proposal with regard to ATSs for government securities and a concept release on fixed-income market structure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Based upon public input, in 2022, we reproposed rules for ATSs for government securities and proposed to modernize the definition of an exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Commenters had noted that much of secondary market trading in Treasuries and corporate bonds also were facilitated by request-for-quote (RFQ) electronic platforms between dealers and customers.</p>
<p>In particular, the Commission in 2022 sought feedback on whether the definition of an exchange should include platforms, such as RFQ platforms, that perform exchange-like functions in the Treasury markets and elsewhere. While they may not have central limit order books, these are venues where multiple buyers can meet multiple sellers, use structured methods to negotiate a trade, and can agree to the terms of a trade.</p>
<p>Ensuring that such exchange-like platforms follow our exchange-specific rules could benefit investors and markets alike.</p>
<h3>National Market System</h3>
<p><br />In terms of the National Market System, a great deal has changed since we adopted Regulation NMS in 2005. In particular, a large and growing amount of equity trading now occurs in what many call the dark markets, particularly off-exchange market centers such as wholesalers and dark pools.</p>
<p>Trade volumes went up about twofold to 11 billion shares per day from 2007 to 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The one-penny minimum increment used for quoting is outdated, and too wide for many of the securities trading in today&rsquo;s markets. Thus, we proposed a rule to narrow the minimum tick size, making it smaller than a penny for many securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The proposal also would update the more than 120-year-old definition<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;of round lot<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;by determining the size of round lots by the share price. The proposal also would add quotes on odd-lots to core data.</p>
<p>Further, it would bring greater transparency to the access fees charged and related rebates paid by exchanges. In addition, it would lower what exchanges may charge investors to access protected quotes.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposed rules last fall regarding exchanges&rsquo; volume-based transaction rebates and fees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Currently, midsized and smaller exchange member broker-dealers effectively pay higher fees than larger members to trade on most exchanges. Members with the largest trading volume receive the largest rebates and thus pay the lowest net fees.</p>
<h3>Best Execution</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long considered broker-dealers&rsquo; best execution duty to their customers to be critical to both trust and competition in the markets.</p>
<p>Thus, I was surprised to learn when I came to the SEC that the Commission actually didn&rsquo;t have its own best execution rule. The best execution rule was instituted, instead, by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an SRO, and it was last updated in 2014.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), another SRO, implemented its first best execution rule for municipal securities in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p>I believe a best execution standard is too central to the SEC&rsquo;s mandate to protect investors, not to have on the books as a Commission rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Rapid developments in our markets make best execution that much more important.</p>
<h3>Order Competition and Execution Quality</h3>
<p><br />Every day, investors turn to broker-dealers in the markets&mdash;often through brokerage apps&mdash;to build a better financial future.</p>
<p>How do you know, however, the quality of the broker&rsquo;s execution of your order? You can turn to measures that compare the price you received with what&rsquo;s called the National Best Bid and Offer at a particular time.</p>
<p>This information is measurable, but historically the brokers whose apps you&rsquo;re using haven&rsquo;t been required to disclose execution quality in that way.</p>
<p>Thus, last month we finalized rules to require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>We also proposed a rule in 2022 regarding exposing marketable orders of individual investors of a certain size to fair and open auctions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/prepared-remarks-sec-speaks-us-capital-markets-and-public-good#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>About 90 percent of individual investors&rsquo; marketable orders in NMS stocks are routed to a small group of off-exchange wholesalers, operating in the dark market. That doesn&rsquo;t seem to promote the greatest competition or fairness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback on this proposal and are considering all of the comments.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><br />The U.S. capital markets are a national asset. Trust in the markets is a public good. Capital market efficiency, competition, and liquidity are public goods.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress understood this in the 1930s. Ford and Congress understood this in the 1970s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>They also understood that the need for the SEC to promote these public goods is evergreen. Technology and business models, though, are everchanging.</p>
<p>Thus, as we have done for 90 years, we will continue to update rules of the road for investors and issuers alike.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders Australian Swap Dealer To Pay $500,000 For Supervision Failures</title>

<div> Order, ANZ, CFTC, surveillance, penalty
<br />
ANZ violated supervision obligations by failing to ensure its spoofing surveillance tool was effective, resulting in a $500,000 penalty.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.</span>&nbsp;(ANZ), a financial services firm provisionally registered as a swap dealer for violating its supervision obligations for failing&nbsp;</span><span>to ensure its spoofing surveillance tool was operating effectively.</span>&nbsp;<span><span>ANZ admitted the facts in the order.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The order requires ANZ to pay a $500,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations as charged.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>During the course of a CFTC investigation into ANZ&rsquo;s trading activity, ANZ disclosed to CFTC staff that a surveillance tool ANZ used to monitor for spoofing activity by its traders was not operating effectively for futures data supplied by one vendor from November 2019 to June 2020 (First Gap Period) and then again from November 2020 to February 2021 (Second Gap Period). For both the First and Second Gap Periods, there was a mismatch between the time when the relevant data was ingested into the surveillance tool and the time when the tool was run.&nbsp;</span></span><span>The surveillance tool was run against, among other things, trading in Eurodollar futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which ANZ used in part to hedge its various swap positions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Specifically, during the two Gap Periods, the tool was run on a daily basis before certain data was ingested into the tool, and thus the tool failed to surveil any of the futures data from the vendor at issue. Moreover, even after discovering the First Gap Period and resetting the time so the tool would be run after the relevant data was received, ANZ did not put into place additional safeguards to prevent the timing issue from recurring. In fact, the issue did recur. The Second Gap Period was caused by the exact same problem as the First Gap Period, and lasted for approximately four additional months before ANZ discovered it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As a result, thousands of orders were not timely surveilled for spoofing and ANZ should have, but did not receive a substantial number of surveillance alerts that would have been generated during the two Gap Periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In accepting ANZ&rsquo;s offer, the CFTC recognized ANZ&rsquo;s substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation of this matter. The CFTC also acknowledged ANZ&rsquo;s representations concerning its remediation in connection with this matter. Specifically, during the investigation, ANZ disclosed both Gap Periods to the CFTC. ANZ also represented that it corrected the timing mismatch as soon as it became aware of it, and following the Second Gap Period, installed additional safeguards to prevent a recurrence. The CFTC&rsquo;s recognition of ANZ&rsquo;s substantial cooperation and remediation is further reflected in the form of a reduced penalty.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Devin Cain, Trevor Kokal, Jordon Grimm, Alejandra de Urioste, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal Sultan, and former staff member Steven I. Ringer.</span></span></span></p>

<div> Regulatory Trajectory, Future of Banking, Bank Mergers, De Novo Bank Formation, Regulatory Approvals
<br />
Summary:
Regulatory challenges for banking future, impact of reform measures, barriers to new bank formation, concerns with M&amp;A process. 
 <div>
<p>Good morning. Before I provide some context for today's discussions, I would like to thank all of our participants who are here with us today in Kansas City at the Reserve Bank, and those participating remotely. Most importantly, I'd like to thank our host, President Schmid, and his excellent research staff, all of whom helped to organize today's event. I especially appreciate the opportunity to highlight a few specific areas that concern me about the currently regulatory trajectory and their effects on the future of banking.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Today's workshop addresses timely and important questions, including the forces that will shape the future of the banking system, entry into the banking system, bank mergers and acquisitions, and the state of competition including both the direct and indirect competition banks experience and how regulators measure and assess competition&mdash;or at least how we broadly measure it today.</p>
<p>The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank just over a year ago, and the stress to the banking system that ensued, caused many institutions to retrench and prompted regulators to renew their focus on bank regulatory and supervisory policy and approach. Banks responded by enhancing their focus on fundamental risks like interest rate and liquidity risk, adopting a more conservative posture in both risk management and lending. This self-reflection by both industry and regulators continues today. In fact, the long shadow of the bank failures continues to be a driving force for regulatory and supervisory reforms, even for reform proposals that have little relationship to the events surrounding the bank failures and ensuing banking system stress.</p>
<p>As I have noted in the past, the regulatory reform agenda, and the less visible but no less important changes to the supervisory process, touch on a wide range of topics that directly and indirectly affect banks of all sizes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The sheer volume of changes presents challenges to regulated institutions. Outside of the largest banks, how does bank management review and provide meaningful comment on voluminous regulatory changes? When those changes are finalized, how does a bank's management reallocate resources to ensure a capability to comply with revised regulations? Are banks, especially small banks, able to locate and retain qualified staff to understand and implement these increasingly complex and burdensome rules? How does a bank's management and compliance officer adjust to supervisory standards and expectations that may be significantly different from exam to exam or regulator to regulator?</p>
<p>The 2023 bank failures and circumstances leading up to those failures continue to warrant review, self-reflection, and appropriately targeted changes to identified issues or failures in regulation and supervision. But we should ask whether the volume of reforms that have been proposed, recently finalized, or that are in the pipeline, reflect appropriate prioritization. Or instead, do they suggest that we have lost our focus on furthering the primary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision&mdash;promoting a safe and sound banking system and fostering a thriving banking industry that effectively supports local and regional economies. I am concerned that the broad-based and insufficiently focused reform agenda has become a growing source of risk to the banking system, particularly due to the rushed nature of these reform efforts and the lack of research and understanding of the intended and unintended consequences of these proposals.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This reform agenda, for both regulation and supervision, is the backdrop for today's panel discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approvals in the Banking System</strong><br />I have previously spoken about the regulatory dynamics shaping the future of the banking system, from bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for services (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to "11" for banks of all sizes, increased competition from non-banks, the continued migration of certain activities from regulated banks to non-banks outside of the banking system, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;These issues continue to shape the contours of the banking system&mdash;including bank size, the activities in which they engage, and where activities occur within the broader financial system. The policy decisions embedded in these regulatory reforms, even if only in the form of a proposal, have already begun shaping the U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>Revisions to the regulatory and supervisory framework reflect policy decisions about not only the risk tolerance of regulators, but also the role of banks in the banking system and the broader U.S. economy. These policy decisions create incentives and impacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and standardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for banks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new banks to successfully compete with existing banks.</p>
<p>When we "raise the bar" for banks to engage in certain activities in a way that is disproportionate to the risk of those activities, we create incentives for those activities to migrate to non-banks outside of the regulatory perimeter. We must understand whether the policy decisions embedded in the regulatory and supervisory framework are effective and complementary. If they are not, we must acknowledge the consequences of knowingly implementing conflicting policy choices.</p>
<p><strong>De Novo Bank Formation</strong><br />I continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. As I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank creation indicated by the ongoing preference for "charter strip" acquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>For the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as the banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time period. Many factors influence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services providers to operate outside of the regulated banking system.</p>
<p>The decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business considerations including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and ensuring the ability to navigate the "start-up" phase of a new bank and manage upfront operational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first several years of de novo bank operation. Yet, perhaps the most important factor that influences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework, which includes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation. Applications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application filing with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) application for deposit insurance. The timeframe for receiving all of the required regulatory approvals to open for business often takes well in excess of a year. Of course, this uncertainty must be endured after initial capital has been raised, shareholders identified, and a management team ready to begin work. As one can imagine, these delays can present unique challenges for de novo founders including incurring more start-up expenses than anticipated, having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified management to obtain approval, and experiencing challenges raising additional start-up capital investment.</p>
<p>Some of the uncertainty surrounding the de novo process flows from supervisory perceptions of this proposed business model. For example, a de novo business plan that focuses on providing banking-as-a-service outside of a defined geographic footprint presents different risks than a business model that focuses on retail banking in an underserved market. It stands to reason that the regulatory expectations for each business model, including capital levels, risk management, and compliance, will vary. Even controlling for the variability in business model, the standards and expectations for a de novo application that will be viewed and treated favorably are opaque and may shift significantly over time, even between and among the regulators.</p>
<p>The absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the banking system, a void that may contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and fairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the continued shift of banking activities beyond the regulatory perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</strong><br />A more immediate concerning influence is the dramatically evolving approach to bank mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by some prudential regulators. It is helpful to consider bank M&amp;A broadly, to include not only bank-to-bank mergers subject to approval under the Bank Merger Act, but also the broader set of business combinations contemplated under sections 3 and 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, and under section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>These M&amp;A transactions allow banks to thrive in our dynamic banking system, and help to promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&amp;A also ensures that some institutions have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. In the absence of a viable M&amp;A framework, we increase the potential for additional risks including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities and zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.</p>
<p>M&amp;A reform is currently a popular topic on the banking agency regulatory agenda with the process and standards regulators employ to review and approve transactions under intense scrutiny. Recently some of the federal banking regulators have proposed or described new M&amp;A policy approaches, with the Department of Justice currently reviewing how it enforces section 7 of the Clayton Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>As regulators revisit the evaluation standards for bank M&amp;A transactions under the statutory framework, we should consider whether the regulatory review process is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. This should begin with an important threshold question&mdash;what are the identified shortcomings with the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings?</p>
<p>One concern that has been raised about the M&amp;A regulatory approval process seems largely based on the misconception that a lack of application&nbsp;<em>denials&nbsp;</em>implies that standards are simply not rigorous enough, that the regulatory approval process has become a rubber stamp. This view ignores the reality of the filing process. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition.</p>
<p>This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers take extremely seriously. They do not make the decision to file an application lightly. Even for those institutions that decide to proceed with an application, success is not guaranteed, even in the absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve's most recent report on banking applications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&amp;A transactions in which applications have been withdrawn.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In its recent proposal, one agency suggested that if an applicant withdraws a filing, that agency's board may release a statement regarding the concerns with the application in the interest of creating transparency for future applicants.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;I have observed that applicants may withdraw a filing for a number of reasons, including prolonged uncertainty due to regulatory delays, expiration of contractual deadlines, and issues that are uncovered only during the processing of the application (for example, the issuance of updated supervisory ratings from recently completed examinations). As a general matter, this approach could evolve to become the expectation for&nbsp;<em>all&nbsp;</em>withdrawn applications, and, if so, could put regulators in the untenable position of needing to disclose confidential supervisory information or nonpublic business information about applicants even in the case of a withdrawn application.</p>
<p>Just as in the de novo bank formation process, one of the key risks to an effective M&amp;A process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.</p>
<p>Reducing the efficiency of bank M&amp;A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions&mdash;it can reduce the effectiveness of M&amp;A activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas, prevent institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and actually undermine competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a "protected class" of larger institutions.</p>
<p>Given all of these considerations, it seems reasonable to assume that the uncertainty of the M&amp;A process itself may act as a deterrent to de novo bank formation, as potential bank founders stay on the sidelines knowing that future exit strategies&mdash;like the strategic acquisition of a de novo bank by a larger peer&mdash;may face long odds of success. We must not foreclose bank merger activities that are permitted by law and that are necessary to maintain a healthy banking system.</p>
<p>Instead, we should focus on ensuring that we can improve the speed and timeliness of regulatory decisionmaking, applying review standards that are reasonable and consistent with the statutory framework. Too often it seems that regulators discount the fact that these organizations do not simply hit the pause button during the merger review process. We must remember that these organizations are businesses that continue to operate and must do so in a way that supports their ongoing business operations and future growth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly focused on other issues, with the timeliness of regulatory action appearing to be lower on the list of priorities. These efforts have not improved the outlook for the bank merger process. Pending reform efforts may actually exacerbate the existing problems, resulting in an increase in the already significant delays in processing times for some applications.</p>
<p>Uncertainty in the standards for an application review can drive delays. A federal agency recently indicated that it may deviate from the longstanding approach to evaluating competitive effects of a merger using a deposit-based analysis. While this analysis could be retained as an initial screen, that agency would "evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger in a manner that is most relevant to each transaction," and "may consider concentrations in any specific products or customer segments&hellip;."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;I imagine bankers contemplating merger transactions will have little capacity to evaluate whether a merger would raise regulatory issues in advance under this open-ended standard.</p>
<p>That proposal also includes revisions to the convenience and needs analysis that may frustrate banks' ability not only to receive regulatory approval, but to manage their businesses going forward. Specifically, the proposal notes that applicants should be "prepared to make commitments regarding future retail banking services in the community to be served for at least three years following consummation of the merger."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;The proposal also suggests that the resulting bank would be expected to "better" meet the convenience and needs of the community to be served than it would absent the merger.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;As is the current expectation, a bank should expect to provide information on their plans for activities and branches as part of the application process. But we should acknowledge that those plans may change over time as conditions evolve. A bank's future activities, whether banking or branching, are subject to regulatory requirements, and oversight through ongoing supervision activities. We need not operate like the applications process is the only tool available to address policy concerns. I expect this proposal would greatly benefit from public input.</p>
<p>Even reported data on current merger processing times may understate the broader application processing timeline. This process often includes preliminary discussions and pre-filings with regulators, and delays between the time an application is filed and when it is "accepted" by the regulator triggering the regulatory processing clock.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Finally, the M&amp;A process can be inappropriately influenced when regulators make demands on firms that are not squarely grounded in statutory approval requirements or based on safety and soundness considerations. During the application deliberation process, regulators can impose limitations or restrictions to address specific supervisory or policy concerns in the form of "conditions" or "commitments" on the approval. While this can be an important tool, it should not be used to replace rulemaking or existing regulations and statutes that guide regulatory action; we should not engage in "regulation by application." Conditions or commitments that impose obligations that are inconsistent with our existing regulatory framework raise issues of significant concern.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240402a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;In these circumstances, our existing rules and regulations are the most appropriate and effective tools to address concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Policymakers continue to play an important role in shaping the future of the banking system, not only through policy choices on substantive regulations and supervisory approaches, but also through their role in bank formations, mergers, and acquisitions. We currently have a dynamic banking system, but these individual pieces of the bank regulatory framework do not function independently. The policy choices embodied in current regulation and supervision, and in proposed reforms, aggregate to influence the future of the banking system, often in ways that are unpredictable, and at times in ways that are in conflict and internally inconsistent.</p>
<p>I hope that today's discussions provide an opportunity to have frank conversations about the dynamics shaping the future of the banking system. And throughout, that we identify opportunities to rationalize regulatory approaches, and ensure that the values regulators say they support&mdash;like the importance of a broad and diverse banking system that includes institutions of all sizes serving all of the different market segments across the country&mdash;are consistent with regulatory actions.</p>
<p>I am concerned that many of these actions may actually undermine the long-term viability of banks. I look forward to hearing the insights of all of our participants today, and thinking more deeply about how regulation, supervision, and ongoing reform efforts can help to positively influence a banking system that will effectively and efficiently serve communities of all sizes, consumers, businesses, and the broader U.S. economy long into the future.</p>

<div> outlook, interest rate, farmland values, investment, government policy<br />
Summary:<br />
Farmers' outlook improved, with expectations for interest rate changes and rising farmland values. Optimism in investment but concerns about policy changes. <div>
<p>U.S. farmers' outlook improved in March as the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4130770-1&amp;h=974163770&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a></span>&nbsp;index increased to 114, marking a 3-point rise from February. While the Index of Current Conditions fell by 2 points to 101, the Index of Future Expectations climbed to 120, up by 5 points from February. The disparity between current and future indexes was primarily influenced by farmers' perceptions of a financial downturn taking place in the past year, coupled with some expectations for improvement over the next 12 months. The March survey was conducted from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 11-15, 2024</span>.</p>
<p>"Producers' expectations for interest rate changes have shifted, which could help explain why producers look for financial conditions to improve," said&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4130770-1&amp;h=4012718913&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">James Mintert</span></a></span>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue University's</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4130770-1&amp;h=2920041404&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</span></p>
<p>This month 48% of respondents said they expect a decline in the U.S. prime interest rate over the next year, up from 35% in December. Just one-third (32%) foresee an increase, compared to 43% last month. Only 20% of respondents this month identified the risk of rising interest rates as a primary concern, a decrease from the 24% recorded&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">December 2023</span>. High input costs continue to be producers' No. 1 concern, with 36% of respondents expressing worry.</p>
<p>The Farm Capital Investment Index increased by 7 points this month, indicating growing optimism among producers about making large investments. Producers who said it is a good time for a large investment rose to 15%, up 11% from the start of the year. This optimism is fueled by producers who pointed to strong cash flows on their farms, coupled with higher dealer inventories for farm machinery. However, some producers still feel hesitant to invest due to concerns about high costs for machinery and construction and high interest rates.</p>
<p>Producers displayed a more optimistic short-term outlook on farmland values in March, with the Short-Term Farmland Values Index rising to 124, a 9-point increase from the previous month. This month, 38% of producers expect farmland values to increase in the coming year, compared to 31% in January and February.</p>
<p>"Factors contributing to this optimism included non-farm investor demand, inflation expectations and strong cash flows. An improved interest rate outlook might have been a factor as well, although producers didn't point to that explicitly in this month's survey," Mintert said.</p>
<p>More farmers this month (24%) said they believe farmland prices will go up because of inflation expectations compared to last month (18%). There was also a slight increase in producers citing strong cash flows (8% in March versus 6% in February) as a reason, and a modest decline in the number of producers who mentioned non-farm investor demand as a major factor influencing the farmland market. However, despite this decline, 57% of producers still consider non-farm investor demand the primary reason for their bullish outlook on farmland values.</p>
<p>Interest in using farmland for carbon sequestration or solar energy production appears to be increasing. In this month's survey, nearly 1 out of 5 respondents (18%) said they or their landowners had been approached about carbon capture utilization and storage on their farmland. Additionally, 12% of this month's respondents said they had discussions with companies interested in leasing farmland for a solar energy project in the last six months, compared to 10% in February. When it comes to long-term farmland lease rates offered by solar energy companies, 54% of respondents this month said they were offered&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1,000</span>&nbsp;or more per acre, while just over one-fourth (27%) were offered&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1,250</span>&nbsp;or more per acre.</p>
<p>The March barometer also revealed that many farmers are concerned about potential government policy changes affecting their farms following this year's elections. Forty-three percent of respondents anticipate more restrictive regulations for agriculture. Additionally, 4 out of 10 (39%) producers expect taxes impacting agriculture to rise.</p>

<div> Blockchain, Overledger, enterprise, pricing plans, interoperable<br />
<br />
Summary: Quant has launched new pricing plans for Overledger, making it available for free and offering two new SaaS plans. Overledger also comes with powerful new enhancements. <div>
<p>Quant, the blockchain for finance pioneer, today launched new pricing plans and functionality aimed at enterprise IT users and developers tasked by their business lines with implementing blockchain technology as part of their organisation&rsquo;s wider digital asset strategy. The Overledger blockchain platform updates are designed to empower enterprise project teams, architects and developers from any sector or size to test, build and deploy on the same interoperable distributed ledger technology already trusted by central banks, commercial banks and large corporates to accelerate their digital asset strategy.</p>
<p>For the first time, Overledger is now available via a fully functional, time-unlimited free plan to allow institutions to easily adopt a technology which is rapidly growing in adoption while creating new revenue streams, making complex workflows more efficient, reducing legacy costs and enabling access to new markets and clients. The new plan is the most powerful free blockchain plan available for any enterprise looking to execute their digital asset strategy; it enables IT end-users and developers to fully test their concepts, build business applications, connect their existing systems and tokenise then launch interoperable digital assets of any type.</p>
<p>For those that want to start deploying on a mainnet blockchain or run more complex proofs of concept or projects with multiple counterparties and networks, Overledger offers two new, self-serve SaaS plans at $179 and $379 per month respectively. These new Overledger plans - unlike blockchain infrastructure products that are aimed solely for node hosting or siloed dApp development, aren&rsquo;t capable of serving regulated financial institutions and central banks, provide limited functionality, and charge by transaction or volume &ndash; are available for just a flat monthly fee, giving customers clarity on their costs and IT budgets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that anyone who wants to build a business in the blockchain economy should be able to do so using technology that has been tried and tested in the most demanding of use cases: regulated financial services,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>says Gilbert Verdian, Founder and CEO</b>. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why these new plans and features meet the demands of IT decision makers: they&rsquo;re an accelerated go-to-market for enterprise IT and developers to choose the best technology and delivery solutions for their business lines at speed &ndash; using the same &lsquo;grown up&rsquo; tech already used by institutions like central banks and their commercial counterparts, securities issuers, and asset managers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Natasha Boyton-West, Head of Product &ndash; Platform, says</b>: &ldquo;Until now, businesses have struggled to capitalise on the benefits of blockchain because it&rsquo;s a complex technology requiring specialist skills and different blockchains are not interoperable with one another. Overledger changes all that. It&rsquo;s easy to use, continually enhanced, and integrates seamlessly with your existing systems and new networks alike. That&rsquo;s how it makes blockchain simple, trusted, and future-proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As before, bespoke enterprise plans - backed by comprehensive service level agreements, dedicated infrastructure and all the specialist expertise of the Quant team - are also available for clients that are ready to put their blockchain solutions into mainstream production.</p>
<p>Overledger now comes with powerful new enhancements across the board too, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Blockchain platform as a service:</b>&nbsp;A simple way for users to run their own dedicated blockchain testing environment with complete security and privacy.</li>
<li><b>Smart contract API:</b>&nbsp;Users can now deploy and launch any smart contract on any chain with ease.</li>
<li><b>Transaction signing:</b>&nbsp;There is no need to set up key management solutions to sign test transactions; it&rsquo;s now built-in at platform level.</li>
<li><b>Secure transactions:&nbsp;</b>All transactions are co-signed with an additional level of security expected by enterprise security.</li>
<li><b>Agents:</b>&nbsp;Both Make and Zapier integrations are available for Overledger, enabling powerful code-free automation with any blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<div> AIMO, Kaggle, AI model, mathematics, progress prize
<br />
Summary: 
XTX Markets is offering a $1.048 million progress prize for the AIMO on Kaggle to develop AI models for mathematical reasoning. Dr. Geoff Smith is delighted. 
<br /> <div>
<p>XTX Markets is excited to announce the opening of the first $1.048 million progress prize for the Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO), on the Kaggle platform.</p>
<p>This initiative is part of the $10 million AIMO Prize, launched in November 2023, aimed at fostering the development of AI models capable of mathematical reasoning. The ultimate goal is to create a publicly shared AI model that could achieve a gold medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).</p>
<p>The grand prize of $5 million will be awarded to the first AI model that competes in an AIMO Prize-approved competition and attains a performance equivalent to an IMO gold medal.</p>
<p>To encourage continuous progress towards this goal, XTX Markets has introduced a series of progress prizes.</p>
<p>This first progress prize includes problems at intermediate-level high school mathematics competitions, but do not reach IMO difficulty. It is open from 1 April to 27 June, with the prizes to be distributed to up to five teams in July 2024 at the 65th IMO in Bath, UK.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Progress Prize Details</span>:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>$1.048 million prize pool.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;Kaggle platform's private leaderboard will determine the distribution of $253,952 among the top five teams, based on minimum performance criteria.</li>
<li>Remainder of the pool will go to the first team scoring at least 47/50 on both public and private leaderboards. If not won, it will roll over to the next year's prize pool.</li>
<li>Eligibility for prizes requires the open publication of the teams' code, methodology, data, and model parameters.</li>
</ul>

Summary:
ASDA and Worldline extend their partnership for an omnichannel payment solution to enhance customer experience, gain insights, and optimize costs. <div>
<p><span>Worldline (Euronext: WLN), a global leader in payment services, announces the extension of its 16-year partnership with ASDA, the UK&rsquo;s third-largest supermarket group, to deliver a full omnichannel payment solution, for an initial period of five years.</span></p>
<p>As the UK witnesses a significant surge in online food and grocery shopping &ndash; projected to rise from &pound;25.3 billion in 2022 to &pound;29.3 billion in 2025 (Statista) &ndash; ASDA is strategically investing in enhancing the user experience for its 18 million weekly customers.</p>
<p>To ensure a seamless payment experience for ASDA&rsquo;s customers, the entire payment process chain is consolidated under Worldline as a single provider. ASDA integrates Worldline's omnichannel payment solution, including terminals, acquiring services, and smart routing through Worldline Payment Orchestration, to enhance the customer experience and operational efficiency for approximately 800,000 weekly deliveries.</p>
<p>By collaborating with Worldline, ASDA anticipates gaining valuable insights about their customers, empowering them to tailor their offerings to better meet evolving needs.

<div> mentors, career achievement award, social equity, civil rights movement, diversity initiative<br />
<br />
Acceptance of career achievement award from Duke University's Cook Center on Social Equity, emphasizes the importance of mentors, civil rights movement, and ongoing commitment to justice and opportunity.<br />
Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Dr. Darity, for your kind introduction. I am profoundly moved to be surrounded by family and friends, and it gives me another opportunity to tell all of you that I would not be where I am today without your support. I include in that circle my fellow award recipients today, Drs. Cecilia Rouse and Peter Blair Henry.</p>
<p>I am beyond humbled and honored to receive this career achievement award from The Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity at Duke University, and I am inspired by what it represents. Of course, to me, Samuel DuBois Cook was simply "Uncle Sam." My Uncle Sam was a Korean War veteran, a political theorist, an activist, and the first African American tenured professor at Duke and any major southern university. He then went on to become president of Dillard University . . . the list goes on and on. Now that was a lifetime of achievement.</p>
<p>At Morehouse College, Uncle Sam was a classmate of a young man named Martin Luther King, Jr. Before that, they picked tobacco together during the summer to earn the money they needed for their studies. Uncle Sam led the campus chapter of the NAACP at Morehouse and went on to become student body president (twice) and valedictorian. Along with my mother Mary Murray Cook, his brother and my dad Rev. Payton Brailsford Cook, my cousin and civil rights leader Floyd McKissick, Sr., and a host of other relatives, he instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better. When I was beaten and suffered verbal assaults while desegregating my schools in Georgia, I drew strength from the example set by my uncle, my aunts, my parents, and by Dr. King and their conviction that there is great hope and promise in the world. It was&mdash;and remains&mdash;the duty of everyone in and who embraced and was inspired by the Civil Rights Movement to make good on that hope and promise and to build a better future.</p>
<p>I mentioned great effort. That was always paramount for my Uncle Sam.&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;quoted his advice: "Have a vision&mdash;a dream of success&mdash;and work like hell."</p>
<p>Uncle Sam believed people need guides, role models, and taskmasters to take advantage of the greater opportunities he helped to make possible. We call those guides, role models, and taskmasters "mentors" for short.</p>
<p>I found many mentors along my academic journey, and I would like to give special thanks to those I met through the Diversity Initiative for Tenure in Economics, which Sandy Darity started at Duke in 2008. The Initiative is a research mentoring workshop that pairs junior faculty with mentors who can help them navigate the path to tenure. It has seen 53 Initiative fellows being promoted and tenured at institutions of higher learning.</p>
<p>I am grateful to all the mentors who took my ideas seriously, including Art Goldsmith who was a DITE mentor, helped me sharpen the hypotheses that emerged from them, and pressed me to think hard about the best data and methods to test these hypotheses. Graduate and undergraduate students from many backgrounds ask me how to find mentors that share their background. I tell them they will need more than one mentor and to seek out mentors who have different backgrounds and expertise such that they will be exposed to a wide range of views and experiences. For just one paper on violence and patents, I had several mentors, among them George Akerlof, Ken Arrow, Sandy Darity, Barry Eichengreen, Milton Friedman, Alan Krueger, Paul Romer, and Jeff Wooldridge. Most importantly, make sure your mentors challenge you and hold you accountable. And when the time comes, it is incumbent on you&mdash;on all of us, really&mdash;to become a mentor. That is what Uncle Sam did. That is one reason I was grateful to lead the American Economic Association's Summer Program, to receive the AEA Mentoring Program's Impactful Mentor award for working with graduate students, and to participate in and support other initiatives to train young economists. Mentors help convert hope and promise into action, enabling those who come after us to build a better future. As I learned from Uncle Sam, there is no higher calling.</p>
<p>In closing, let me express my hope that accepting this career achievement award does not mean I am officially retired. But more seriously, I am very grateful to be recognized and in the company of colleagues who have stood by me and fought with me to improve our field. I accept this award in the spirit of challenge it represents. I am forever mindful of Samuel DuBois Cook's belief that there is much work ahead of us as we seek to build a world that is more just and offers more opportunity for all. Although this may be called a career achievement award, I accept it with the conviction that I am just getting started.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Trading Up To A 25% More Expensive Home Would More Than Double The Average Mortgage Holder’s Payment</title>

<div> mortgage, home prices, inventory, interest rates, lock-in effect
Summary:<br />Inventory levels have improved slightly. Home sales are rising with lower interest rates. Lock-in effect on existing mortgages is keeping inventory low. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>From 2000 to 2022, upgrading to a 25% more expensive home would have required the average homeowner to increase their principal and interest payment by roughly 40%, or about $400 per month</li>
<li>Today, that same trade-up buyer&rsquo;s payment would increase by an average of $1,384 per month, a 103% jump that highlights the real-world pressures keeping current mortgage holders &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to their homes</li>
<li>Simply giving up their current rate to move across the street to an equivalently priced home in today&rsquo;s market would result in a nearly 40% increase in P&amp;I &ndash; roughly as much as the historical trade-up cost</li>
<li>Homeowners who took out mortgages when rates were near record lows in 2020 and 2021 face an even steeper &ldquo;move across the street&rdquo; cost, with such a lateral move requiring a 60% higher monthly payment</li>
<li>Trading up for these borrowers &ndash; who account for two out of every five active mortgages &ndash; would take a 132% increase in monthly P&amp;I</li>
<li>The trade-up cost &ndash; and the associated lock-in effect &ndash; varies significantly across geographies, from a 72% payment increase on the low end in Buffalo to more than 140% in Los Angeles and San Jose</li>
<li>Inventory remains constricted, but improved, as 65% of major U.S. markets have more homes available for sale today than at this time last year</li>
<li>Lower interest rates in late Q4 and early Q1 led to home sales in February hitting their highest adjusted level since March 2023</li>
<li>The February ICE Home Price Index showed strength in the market, with adjusted home prices rising by +0.43%, up from +0.33% in January, which is equivalent to a +5.3% seasonally adjusted annualized rate</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">April 2024 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>There are many headwinds facing the would-be seller in today&rsquo;s market, making their existing mortgage payment particularly attractive in comparison. While this has been the case for some time, according to Andy Walden, Vice President of Enterprise Research Strategy, the ICE Research and Analysis team sought to quantify this "lock-in effect" beyond simply identifying the number of borrowers within or below a given interest rate band.</p>
<p>"After American mortgage holders secured some of the lowest first lien rates ever and benefited from record home price growth on top of that, we wanted to quantify just how locked-in folks truly are and what kind of rate declines would be needed to shake some of that inventory loose," said Walden. "Leveraging the ICE Home Price Index and our loan level mortgage data, we looked at how much it would cost the average homeowner with a mortgage to trade up to a 25% more expensive home in today's market &ndash; or to simply move across the street, for that matter, into a home identical to their own. The results were bracing, to say the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That average homeowner&rsquo;s mortgage payment would more than double, to gain just 25% in property value &ndash; hardly an entertaining proposition. That said, you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a more vivid illustration of the lock-in effect that&rsquo;s kept for sale inventory in a hole for the last few years. Simply giving up their current rate to move across the street to an equivalently priced home in today&rsquo;s market would result in a nearly 40% increase in P&amp;I, an average of $500 more per month. Lower rates would ease the calculation for many and make moves more reasonable. But the net result continues to be too few homes for too many buyers. Until that fundamental mismatch is addressed, simple supply and demand will continue to press on both inventory and affordability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though inventory remains constricted, there have been some signs of improvement. While still lagging 40% below pre-pandemic averages, February&rsquo;s inventory deficit was the shallowest of any February since 2020. Inventory levels rose in 60 of the 100 largest U.S. markets in the month, with 65% of major markets having more homes available for sale today than they did at the same time last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After closing out 2023 at an 11-year low, home sales have begun to improve over the last two months,&rdquo; Walden added. &ldquo;In fact, lower interest rates in late Q4 and early Q1 led to February home sales hitting their highest adjusted level since March 2023. With sales rising, and inventory still tight, months of supply edged slightly lower in February, continuing to provide a floor for home prices. Our February ICE Home Price Index showed strength in that regard, with adjusted home prices rising by +0.43%, up from +0.33% in January, which is equivalent to a +5.3% seasonally adjusted annualized rate. Keep in mind that SAAR had fallen below 1% as recently as five months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lock-in effect on inventory varies significantly across geographies, with the cost to give up an existing mortgage and buy a 25% more expensive home ranging from a low of a 72% payment increase in Buffalo, N.Y., to more than 140% in Los Angeles and San Jose, Calif. While home prices and mortgage amounts are certainly a factor in that increased cost, the effect is compounded by the fact that borrowers in more expensive cities tend to have both lower mortgage rates and higher unpaid balances on their existing homes. Because of this, the lock-in effect on inventories may be strongest in more expensive California markets such as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose &ndash; markets that also face challenges in terms of new construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortgage rates need to come down to dislodge the lock-in effect,&rdquo; Walden concluded. &ldquo;Since most factors influencing 30-year rates are out of lenders&rsquo; control, they need to be able to find ways to compress spreads without simultaneously compressing their own profit margins. That&rsquo;s key to our mission at ICE &ndash; identifying and eliminating inefficiencies in housing finance through technology, while finding smarter, faster, cheaper and more transparent ways to originate loans and increase liquidity."</p>

<div> regulators, transaction reporting, Earth's rotation, timekeeping systems, UTC adjustment
Summary:<br />The financial regulators are evaluating if regulations on transaction reporting and clock synchronization need revisions due to Earth's rotation impact on UTC. Concerns arise over possible market abuse judgments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Major financial regulators are set to hold an urgent virtual meeting today, April 1, to evaluate if existing regulations on transaction reporting, order record-keeping, and clock synchronisation need revisions in light of climate change's impacts on Earth's rotation and timekeeping systems.</p>
<p>Trading venues and participants must align their business clocks with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to the millisecond or finer for recording reportable events. This synchronisation is crucial for accuracy in timestamping events sent to the central repository.</p>
<p>Recent scientific findings highlight global warming's significant effect on Earth's rotation speed, necessitating periodic adjustments to UTC. These adjustments ensure atomic clocks, which are far more precise, remain in sync with the slight variations in Earth's rotation and prevent the discrepancy in day length from increasing.</p>
<p>A recent study in the journal Nature attributes the accelerating melting of polar ice due to human activities as a new contributing factor to these distortions, effectively slowing Earth's spin and impacting our timekeeping adjustments.</p>
<p>Historically, to match the day's length with atomic time, leap seconds were added when Earth's rotation lagged behind caesium clocks. For instance, in 1972, the "rotation day" extended 0.025 seconds longer than the "atomic day", leading to a cumulative 0.7 seconds delay over a year. This delay was corrected by incorporating an extra second at the year's end. Such adjustments were standard until recent shifts in Earth's interior began to speed up its rotation, suggesting the possible need to subtract a leap second in 2026 for the first time.</p>
<p>This potential change in UTC adjustment raises concerns among regulators about the implications for market abuse judgments, which legal experts could challenge.</p>
<p>Avril Feuilherade, spokesperson for the Council of Regulators, emphasised, "Timing is everything."</p>

<div> audit, transactions, non-compliance, SGX RegCo, EY

Summary:
SGX RegCo directed ecoWise to commission audits and appointed special auditor EY. EY's report highlighted transactions concerns, non-compliance, and actions to be taken. SGX RegCo will require ecoWise to provide a satisfactory trading resumption proposal and will investigate potential listing rule breaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) refers to the Notice of Compliance issued to ecoWise Holdings Limited on 25 June 2021 and the company&rsquo;s announcement dated 28 March 2024 on the findings of the special audit by the special auditor, Ernst &amp; Young Advisory Pte Ltd (&ldquo;EY&rdquo;). EY reports the findings directly to SGX RegCo and the company&rsquo;s relevant sponsors during the relevant period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Background&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On 14 June 2021, the company announced the group&rsquo;s financial results for the half-year ended 30 April 2021 (&ldquo;1HFY2021 Results&rdquo;). The announcement indicated that the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, Mr. Lee Thiam Seng (&ldquo;Mr. Lee&rdquo;) did not agree to the release of the 1HFY2021 Results and therefore, did not provide his confirmation on the accuracy of the financial statements as required under the Listing Rules. SGX RegCo queried the company on the announcement on the same day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 June 2021, the company requested for a trading halt (which was subsequently converted into a trading suspension) as the directors could not unanimously agree and finalise their response to SGX RegCo. The company subsequently announced on 25 June 2021, among others, that Mr. Lee had concerns over certain transactions and their impact on the group&rsquo;s 1HFY2021 Results due to insufficient information provided to him by the finance team.</p>
<p>In light of the above developments, SGX RegCo directed the company, among others, to (i) commission its statutory auditor from RSM Chio Lim LLP (&ldquo;RSM Chio Lim&rdquo;) to perform an audit of its 1HFY2021 Results and (ii) appoint a suitable independent special auditor to look into the transactions raised by Mr. Lee, and the corporate governance of the group. EY was appointed as the special auditor on 27 August 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RSM Chio Lim&rsquo;s audit findings suggested that the group had PRC-incorporated subsidiaries that were not consolidated with the group and there were transactions between the group and an entity called Hong Kong Chen Bang Investments Ltd (&ldquo;HK Chen Bang&rdquo;), purportedly associated with the Group&rsquo;s former Executive Director and Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Cao Shixuan (&ldquo;Mr. Cao&rdquo;). EY was therefore directed by SGX RegCo to expand the scope of the special audit to include transactions undertaken by the unconsolidated entities as well as with HK Chen Bang (the &ldquo;Expanded Scope&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span>Findings from EY&rsquo;s Special Audit Report</span></p>
<p><span>Transactions raised by Mr. Lee</span></p>
<p>The transactions which Mr. Lee had concerns on were: (a) arbitration with China Hua Dian Engineering Co., Ltd, (b) liquidation of China-UK Low Carbon Enterprise Co., Ltd, an entity which the company had an indirect 20% equity interest in, and (c) disposal of Saiko Rubber (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and the use of disposal proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EY did not observe any irregularities in these transactions, aside from the non-disclosure of key milestones relating to the arbitration with China Hua Dian. Certain key matters of these transactions were either not reported to the board of directors, or updates to the board of directors were unclear or inaccurate. EY further observed that ecoWise&rsquo;s board apparently relied on the former sponsors to advise on matters that require announcements. However, as the former sponsors were not always made aware of developments within the company, they were unable to advise the company accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Transactions under the Expanded Scope</span></p>
<p>The transactions covered under the Expanded Scope included the review of the transactions undertaken by the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries and the group&rsquo;s transactions with HK Chen Bang which took place primarily in PRC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Available documents showed that Mr. Cao was the legal representative and/or the executive director of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries, and his role was to oversee the Company&rsquo;s operations in the PRC. The transactions under the Expanded Scope were primarily handled by Mr. Cao. EY reported that they were unable to obtain clarity on those transactions due to the lack of comprehensive records maintained by the group and Mr. Cao also did not accede to EY&rsquo;s request for information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Instances of non-compliance&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>EY reported certain key controls lapses, such as when payment amounts were split to circumvent the existing payment approval matrix to supposedly expedite the payment process, record keeping on payments was poor, lack of policies on matters that require company announcement, and matters that should be escalated to the board of directors.</p>
<p>EY also highlighted potential listing rule breaches relating to the non-disclosure of the group&rsquo;s ongoing arbitration with China Hua Dian and the existence of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries, internal control lapses, as well as potential contravention of Section 160 of the Companies Act in relation to the failure to obtain company&rsquo;s approval for the disposal of the unconsolidated PRC subsidiaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Actions by SGX RegCo</span></p>
<p>Mr. Cao was involved in the transactions under the Expanded Scope and did not attend the interviews arranged by EY. He also failed to provide further information to EY on the transactions, when requested. Consequently, EY was unable to conduct a thorough examination of the transactions. In light of his failure to extend cooperation, Mr. Cao will be placed on our Directors&rsquo; and Executive Officers&rsquo; Watchlist. Issuers who intend to appoint him must seek the views and guidance of SGX RegCo before any proposed appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will require ecoWise to provide a satisfactory trading resumption proposal that include, among others, the following: (a) a clean audit opinion for the latest set of financial statements, (b) a viable and sustainable business, (c) demonstration of its ability to operate as a going concern, (d) assessment and confirmations by the Board and sponsor on the adequacy of working capital for at least 12 months following trading resumption and (e) an independent attestation on the effectiveness and adequacy of its internal controls, which takes into account EY&rsquo;s recommendations (where still relevant) and its operating environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX RegCo will investigate the potential listing rule breaches highlighted in the EY Report and refer any potential contraventions of the law to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</p>

<div> launch, COSMIC, financial institutions, money laundering, terrorism financing<br />
Summary:<br />
MAS launched COSMIC, a platform for FIs to share customer info to combat financial crimes. Collaboration with major banks to safeguard against criminal behavior. <div>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today launched COSMIC&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-launches-cosmic-platform#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;, the first centralised digital platform to facilitate sharing of customer information among financial institutions (FIs) to combat money laundering (ML), terrorism financing (TF) and proliferation financing (PF)&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-launches-cosmic-platform#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;globally. The Financial Services and Markets (Amendment) Act 2023 and accompanying subsidiary legislation, which set out the legal basis and safeguards for such sharing, commenced on the same day.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Following public consultation in October 2021, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (FSMA) was amended in May 2023 to set out the legislative framework for COSMIC. A COSMIC participant FI may share customer information with another participant FI only if the customer&rsquo;s profile or behaviour displays certain objectively-defined indicators of suspicion, or &ldquo;red flags&rdquo;. The FSMA requires participant FIs to have in place policies and operational safeguards to protect the confidentiality of information shared. This will allow participant FIs to share information on potential criminal behaviour while safeguarding the interests of the vast majority of customers who are legitimate. Customers are encouraged to continue to provide timely responses if requested by FIs to provide clarifications on their risk profiles or transactions, so that FIs can make informed risk assessments.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>COSMIC was co-developed by MAS and six major commercial banks in Singapore - DBS, OCBC, UOB, Citibank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank. These banks will be the participant FIs on COSMIC during its initial phase. Information sharing is currently voluntary and focused on three key financial crime risks in commercial banking, namely: (a) misuse of legal persons; (b) misuse of trade finance for illicit purposes; and (c) proliferation financing.</p>
<p>4<span> </span>Ms Loo Siew Yee, Assistant Managing Director (Policy, Payments &amp; Financial Crime), MAS, said, &ldquo;COSMIC will enable FIs to warn each other of suspicious activities and make more informed risk assessments on a timely basis. It complements the industry&rsquo;s existing close collaboration with MAS and law enforcement authorities to combat financial crime. This will strengthen Singapore&rsquo;s capabilities to uphold our reputation as a well-regulated and trusted financial centre.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Saudi Exchange has hit a milestone of 400 listed securities</li>
<li>In 2023, IPOs on the Saudi Exchange accounted for over 70% of GCC IPOs, with a robust pipeline supporting the Exchange&rsquo;s accelerated growth to become one of the top 10 largest exchanges globally according to the World Federation of Exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Saudi Exchange has welcomed its 400th listing across all securities. This achievement highlights the Exchange&rsquo;s pivotal role in the Kingdom&rsquo;s economy, underpinned by robust international investor interest and a diverse range of securities within a highly dynamic market landscape.</p>
<p>Since its establishment 16 years ago, the Saudi Exchange has quickly grown to become one of the top ten largest in the world, the third largest amongst emerging market peers, and the largest exchange in the MENA region. The Saudi Exchange also consistently ranks in the top ten exchanges globally for IPO proceeds and accounted for over 70% of GCC IPOs in 2023. With a substantial SAR 11.9 billion ($3.2 billion) raised through IPOs on the Main Market in 2023, the Saudi Exchange has firmly established itself as a significant contributor to the global IPO landscape, a key driver of its continued growth in scope and scale. In 2023, furthermore, the Tadawul All Share Index grew by 14.2%, outpacing the 9.8% growth of the benchmark MSCI Emerging Market Index.</p>
<p>With a commitment to offering a broad spectrum of financial instruments, the Saudi Exchange has successfully cultivated a diverse portfolio. As of March 27th 2024, the Saudi Exchange has 216 securities listed on the Main Market, 83 on the Nomu &ndash; Parallel Market, 71 Sukuk &amp; Bonds, 19 REITs, 9 ETFs and 2 CEFs.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Nasser Al Ajaji, Chief of Listing, said, &ldquo;The 400th listed security on the Saudi Exchange marks a significant milestone and is a clear testament to the Kingdom's dynamic capital market and its growing appeal to investors globally. In only 16 years, the Saudi Exchange has grown rapidly to rank among the top ten stock exchanges in the world. These achievements are more than just a number; they are symbolic of the economic diversity and growth spurred by Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the Financial Sector Development Program, and the support of the CMA to accelerate the IPO pipeline. All of this reflects the potential we are poised to realize."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Saudi Exchange is dedicated to enhancing the Kingdom&rsquo;s capital market infrastructure, diversifying product and service offerings, and continuing to provide opportunities that support the economic ambitions of Saudi Arabia and its participants.</p>
