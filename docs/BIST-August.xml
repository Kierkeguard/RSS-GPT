<h3>About TIC Data</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<p>Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), demonstrating a shared commitment to fostering collaboration and advancing cross-border trading and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>The MoU, signed by Chen Feng, Director of International Cooperation Department at SZSE, and Afra Al Suwaidi, Chief Executive Officer of Dubai Central Securities Depository, a subsidiary of DFM, aims to further enhance cross-border partnerships between the UAE and China, bolstering the capital markets landscape in both geographies. The official signing of the MoU was witnessed by H.E. Sha Yan, Chairperson, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, H.E Ou Boqian, Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Dubai, and Hamed Ali, CEO of Dubai Financial Market &amp; Nasdaq Dubai.</p>
<p>The collaboration formalized between the exchanges will facilitate joint roadshows, seminars, research initiatives and training programs aimed at promoting the development of capital markets in both countries and cross-border financing for listed companies. Both exchanges will explore cooperation on dual-listing, ETFs, mutual display of indices and fixed-income products, (subject to necessary regulatory approvals), facilitating a more informed and convenient access to secondary market activities in both countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategic partnership will act as a catalyst for the exchange of experience and insights in vital areas such as market and product development, regulatory and ESG practices, and IT capacity building. This will lay a solid foundation for fostering deeper collaboration in the future.</p>
<p>The representative from SZSE remarked that, in recent years, SZSE has steadfastly advanced high-standard two-way opening up. The signing of the MoU marks a key opportunity to conduct bilateral roadshows and promotional activities, enrich cross-border two-way investment and financing products and channels, deepen practical cooperation between China and the UAE, and strengthen the capital market&rsquo;s capacity to serve the real economies of both countries.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Keywords: FCA, censure, Macintyre Hudson LLP, client assets, audit breaches <br />
Summary: The FCA censured auditor Macintyre Hudson LLP for failing to prepare client assets reports and notify rule breaches, impacting consumer protection. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has censured the auditor Macintyre Hudson LLP (MHA) for failing to prepare client assets reports to the required standard.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>MHA failed to notify the FCA of rule breaches by firms it had audited, which could have put customers&rsquo; money at risk.</p>
<p>Client asset protection is a key part of maintaining market confidence, financial stability and consumer protection. Firms that hold client assets are required to have an auditor provide a client assets report to the FCA on an annual basis except in limited circumstances. The FCA relies on the accuracy of these client assets reports to monitor whether firms are complying with its rules, so it is important that auditors ensure their reporting is accurate.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s investigation found that between 2015 and 2019, MHA failed to prepare 4 client assets reports (relating to 2 firms) to the required standard. It failed to report 25 breaches of the rules by firms it had audited. These ranged from failings in documentation, to firm&rsquo;s assets being held alongside client assets.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'In a first of its kind, this censure underscores the important role that auditors play in providing accurate reports on whether firms are complying with our rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'This information helps us to safeguard customer funds and reduce the harm caused by firm failures. We expect all firms to ensure that they&rsquo;re providing full and accurate reports.'</p>

<li><a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/CASS/" target="_blank" title="CASS Client Assets | FCA Handbook">CASS rules</a>&nbsp;are particularly important when firms fail or exit the market.

<title>CFTC Orders Truist Bank To Pay $3 Million Penalty And Remediate Recordkeeping And Supervision Failures Relating To Widespread Use Of Unapproved Communications Methods - Truist Receives Substantially Reduced Penalty For Self-Reporting To The Division Of Enforcement</title>

<div> self-report, cooperation, recordkeeping, supervision, penalty
Summary:
Truist Bank settled charges with CFTC for recordkeeping and supervision violations, self-reported, cooperated, and paid a reduced penalty. SEC also imposed penalties.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against North Carolina swap dealer&nbsp;Truist Bank. The order finds Truist failed to maintain, preserve, or produce records required to be kept under CFTC recordkeeping requirements. Truist also failed to diligently supervise matters related to its business as a CFTC swap dealer.</p>
<p>Truist admits the facts detailed in the order, is ordered to cease and desist from further violations of recordkeeping and supervision requirements, is ordered to pay a $3 million civil monetary penalty, and is ordered to engage in specific remedial undertakings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truist self-reported it proactively conducted a review of the use of unapproved communications methods by its employees. The review demonstrated widespread and longstanding use of unapproved communication methods by swap dealer employees&mdash;including senior-level employees&mdash;to engage in firm business. The order recognizes Truist&rsquo;s self-report, its substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation, and remediation in the form of a substantially reduced penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In responding to an industry-wide and consequential problem, Truist set itself apart from the more than 20 other registrants the CFTC brought actions against for use of unapproved communications methods. How? Truist made the decision to self-report to the Division of Enforcement it had serious recordkeeping and supervisory failures. It is the only registrant to do so,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Truist&rsquo;s decision to self-report, cooperate, remediate, and be held accountable allowed it to benefit in the form of a substantially reduced penalty. At the same time, the CFTC&rsquo;s message remains clear&mdash;recordkeeping and supervision requirements are fundamental, and registrants that fail to comply with these core obligations do so at their own peril.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>From December 2019 through the present, Truist&rsquo;s policies and procedures broadly prohibited employees from using unapproved communication methods, such as personal text messages and social applications, to engage in business-related communications about the firm&rsquo;s swap dealer. Truist required regular attestations from swap dealer employees that they were not using personal text messages and social applications to engage in business-related communications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Messages sent through Truist-approved communications methods were monitored, subject to review, and when appropriate, archived. By contrast, messages sent using unapproved communication methods, including personal text messages, were generally not monitored, subject to review, or archived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of Truist&rsquo;s failure to ensure that employees&mdash;including supervisors and senior-level employees&mdash;complied with the firm&rsquo;s communications policies and procedures, Truist failed to maintain many business-related communications, including communications in connection with its commodities and swaps business, and thus failed to diligently supervise its business as a CFTC registrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reviewing public CFTC orders entered with other CFTC registrants for similar conduct, Truist undertook its own internal survey of senior employees, identified potential violations, and promptly self-reported those facts to the CFTC. Truist substantially cooperated with the CFTC&rsquo;s investigation, including expanding and sharing the results of its sampling analysis. Truist represents it is enhancing its disciplinary policies and continuing remediation efforts it began at the time of the self-report.&nbsp;</p>

<div> order, TD Bank, communications surveillance system, civil monetary penalty, supervision requirements
Summary:<br />TD Bank failed to supervise electronic communications over a five-year period, resulting in a $4 million penalty for CFTC violations. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;The Toronto Dominion Bank&nbsp;(TD Bank), a registered swap dealer, for failing to diligently supervise activities related to its business as a CFTC registrant, specifically, its electronic communications surveillance system. This resulted in TD Bank failing to surveil certain communications for hundreds of its swap dealer personnel over a five-year period.</p>
<p>The order requires TD Bank to pay a $4 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations of the CFTC&rsquo;s supervision requirements, and comply with conditions and undertakings specified in the order. TD Bank admits the facts in the order and acknowledges its conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Communications surveillance is a critical component of an effective system of supervision,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;This order and the significant monetary penalty reflect that swap dealers must not only have robust systems to detect and prevent market abuse and other misconduct, they must also vigilantly oversee and monitor those systems to ensure they are working. The CFTC will take appropriate action where a registrant&rsquo;s surveillance systems lack effective oversight and monitoring resulting in supervisory failures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order finds TD Bank lacked effective oversight and internal monitoring over its electronic communications surveillance system, resulting in TD Bank&rsquo;s failure to surveil certain communications for hundreds of its swap dealer personnel over a five-year period.</p>
<p>According to the order, TD Bank allowed its personnel to use an electronic messaging platform and used an automated surveillance tool to surveil communications made over the messaging platform. In 2016, TD Bank had an automated process to ingest messaging platform communications into its surveillance tool, which involved, among other things, updating TD Bank&rsquo;s internal record of&nbsp;messaging platform accounts&nbsp;to include accounts that had been recently created. In July 2016, TD Bank&rsquo;s vendor made a change impacting that automated process, and subsequently, as a temporary measure, TD Bank began updating its internal record of messaging platform accounts on a manual basis. However, in January 2018, TD Bank stopped updating its internal record of accounts manually. As a result, messages from messaging platform accounts for TD Bank personnel created after January 2018 were generally not ingested into TD Bank&rsquo;s surveillance tool and were not surveilled. The order also finds that after switching to the manual process, TD Bank did not put in place any supervision or internal monitoring to ensure the manual process was conducted or detect if it was not.</p>
<p>The order further finds in October 2019, when TD Bank finally updated its automated process to address the July 2016 change by its vendor, TD Bank did not test all of its process for ingesting messages for new accounts into its surveillance tool to ensure it was functioning again as expected. Therefore, TD Bank did not detect there had been another technical change by its vendor that prevented TD Bank&rsquo;s automated process from functioning properly. Instead, TD Bank continued, until March 2023, to fail to surveil messages for all new messaging platform accounts created after January 2018. The order finds TD Bank lacked effective oversight over its electronic communications surveillance system, including that its monitoring to identify gaps in its surveillance was insufficient to alert it to its surveillance gap and that it did not escalate any of its surveillance technology issues to a more senior oversight body until after it discovered its years-long failure in June 2023.</p>
<p>In accepting TD Bank&rsquo;s offer, the CFTC recognized the cooperation of TD Bank with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation. The CFTC also acknowledges TD Bank&rsquo;s representations concerning its remediation in connection with this matter.</p>
<p>The CFTC acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Penina Moisa, Andrew Rodgers, Alejandra de Urioste, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan. Devin Cain and R. Stephen Painter, Jr. also assisted with this matter.</p>

<div> broker-dealers, investment advisers, dually-registered, SEC, recordkeeping<br />
Summary: The SEC charged 26 firms with widespread recordkeeping failures, imposing civil penalties and mandating compliance improvements. Multiple firms self-reported violations.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 26 broker-dealers, investment advisers, and dually-registered broker-dealers and investment advisers for widespread and longstanding failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve electronic communications.</p>
<p>The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders, acknowledged that their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, agreed to pay combined civil penalties of $392.75 million, as outlined below, and have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations. Three of the firms, as noted below, self-reported their violations and, as a result, will pay significantly lower civil penalties than they would have otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., L.P. agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>LPL Financial LLC agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>RBC Capital Markets, LLC agreed to pay a $45 million penalty</li>
<li>BNY Mellon Securities Corporation, together with Pershing LLC, agreed to pay a $40 million penalty</li>
<li>TD Securities (USA) LLC, together with TD Private Client Wealth LLC and Epoch Investment Partners, Inc., agreed to pay a $30 million penalty</li>
<li>Osaic Services, Inc., together with Osaic Wealth, Inc., agreed to pay an $18 million penalty</li>
<li>Cowen and Company, LLC, together with Cowen Investment Management LLC, agreed to pay a $16.5 million penalty</li>
<li>Piper Sandler &amp; Co. agreed to pay a $14 million penalty</li>
<li>First Trust Portfolios L.P. agreed to pay an $8 million penalty</li>
<li>Apex Clearing Corporation agreed to pay a $6 million penalty</li>
<li>Truist Securities, Inc., together with Truist Investment Services, Inc. and Truist&nbsp;Advisory Services, Inc., which self-reported, agreed to pay a $5.5 million penalty</li>
<li>Cetera Advisor Networks LLC, together with Cetera Investment Services LLC, which self-reported, agreed to pay a $4.5 million penalty</li>
<li>Great Point Capital, LLC agreed to pay a $2 million penalty</li>
<li>Hilltop Securities Inc., which self-reported, agreed to pay a $1.6 million penalty</li>
<li>P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP agreed to pay a $1.25 million penalty</li>
<li>Haitong International Securities (USA) Inc. agreed to pay a $400,000 penalty</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As today&rsquo;s enforcement actions against more than two dozen firms reflect, we remain committed to ensuring compliance with the books and records requirements of the federal securities laws, which are essential to investor protection and well-functioning markets,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Among this group of firms, there are several that differentiated themselves by self-reporting prior to the staff&rsquo;s investigation, demonstrating once again the real benefits of proactive cooperation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the SEC&rsquo;s investigations uncovered pervasive and longstanding use of unapproved communication methods, known as off-channel communications, at these firms. As described in the SEC&rsquo;s orders, the firms admitted that, during the relevant periods, their personnel sent and received off-channel communications that were records required to be maintained under the securities laws. The failure to maintain and preserve required records deprives the SEC of these communications in its investigations. The failures involved personnel at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior managers.</p>
<p>The firms were each charged with violating certain recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act, or both. The firms were also each charged with failing to reasonably supervise their personnel with a view to preventing and detecting those violations.</p>
<p>In addition to the significant financial penalties, each of the firms was ordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant recordkeeping provisions and was censured.</p>
<p>Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced settlements with The Toronto Dominion Bank, Cowen and Company, and Truist Bank for related conduct.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into Ameriprise Financial Services, Edward Jones, LPL, Raymond James, and RBC were conducted by Karen E. Willenken, Craig C. Welter, Wesley W. Wintermyer, Christopher M. Castano, and Alison T. Conn.&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into BNY and Pershing, the Cowen entities, Haitong, and the TD entities were conducted by Laurel S. Fensterstock, Austin Thompson, Karolina Klyuchnikova, and Alison R. Levine. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into P. Schoenfeld was conducted by Howard Kim and Adam Grace. Each of these matters was supervised by Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the New York Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Apex Clearing was conducted by Oreste McClung, Brian Higgins, and Brendan McGlynn and was supervised by Scott Thompson and Nicholas Grippo of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into the Cetera entities, First Trust, Great Point, Hilltop, the Osaic entities, and Piper were conducted by Regina LaMonica, Ruta G. Dudenas, Som P. Dalal, Anne C. McKinley, and Amy S. Cotter and were supervised by Kathryn A. Pyszka and Paul A. Montoya of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into the Truist entities were conducted by Grant Swanson and Ian Rupell and were supervised by Laura Josephs.</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Off-Channel Communications Matter</title>

<div> registered APs, CFTC, recordkeeping, enforcement action, investigation
Summary:<br />Registered Associated Persons (APs) of IBs must comply with recordkeeping requirements, and the CFTC should conduct its own investigation.<br />The CFTC allegedly misused its power without evidence of a violation, leading to de-registration of IBs and less market participants.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>I respectfully dissent on&nbsp;<i>In re Cowen and Co.</i>&nbsp;because the administrative record does not include evidence that any CFTC registered Associated Persons (APs)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1">[1]</a>&nbsp;engaged in activity that was in violation of the CFTC&rsquo;s recordkeeping requirements for introducing brokers (IBs), such as maintaining records of transactions, orders, and other business &ldquo;relating to dealing in commodity interests,&rdquo; or communications &ldquo;concerning quotes, solicitations, bids, offers, instructions, trading, and prices that lead to the execution of a transaction in a commodity interest.&rdquo; These are specific types of records.&nbsp;Based on the information in the administrative record, however, the CFTC only reviewed the sample provided by Respondent to the SEC regarding Respondent&rsquo;s FINRA-registered representatives.&nbsp;<i>None of the persons in the SEC sample was a CFTC AP</i>. Consequently, there was no evidence in the administrative record involving CFTC APs and the specific types of records that IBs are required to maintain. I am unable to support an enforcement action that does not have any evidence that the alleged violations actually occurred. Therefore, I must dissent.</p>
<p>This case appears to be the CFTC&rsquo;s piggybacking off the SEC&rsquo;s investigation to misuse the power of the U.S. government to obtain a $3 million settlement from Respondent&mdash;all without any evidence of a CFTC violation. I believe the CFTC should have conducted its own investigation such as, at the very least, its own sample of Respondent&rsquo;s limited number of CFTC APs to determine whether there was, in fact, any violation of CFTC rules.</p>
<p>I note that of the three &ldquo;off-channel communications&rdquo; cases brought against IBs, two of those firms have de-registered with the CFTC. I question if this is solely a coincidence. I am concerned that when faced with the choice whether to engage in business activity subject to CFTC oversight, firms would rather&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;participate in our markets than deal with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The CFTC should be promoting greater access to markets&mdash;not limiting access. In the last several years, customers and clients now have less choice of market participants to conduct trading because of the de-registration of IBs. Fewer market participants leads to less liquidity and less efficient markets. As the saying goes, &ldquo;people vote with their feet.&rdquo; The Commission would do well to listen to what the public is saying.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders TD Bank And Cowen To Pay Civil Monetary Penalties For Recordkeeping And Supervision Failures For Firm-Wide Use Of Unapproved Communication Methods</title>

<div> enforcement, CFTC, TD Bank, Cowen, recordkeeping
Summary:<br /> The CFTC fined TD Bank $75 million and Cowen $3 million for failing to maintain required records and supervise business activities. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued two orders simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;The Toronto Dominion Bank&nbsp;(TD Bank), a swap dealer, and against&nbsp;Cowen and Company&nbsp;(Cowen), previously registered with the CFTC as an introducing broker, for failing to maintain and preserve records that were required to be kept under CFTC recordkeeping requirements and failing to diligently supervise matters related to their businesses as CFTC registrants.</p>
<p>The orders require TD Bank to pay a $75 million civil monetary penalty, and Cowen to pay a $3 million civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;Both admit the facts detailed in the orders, are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of recordkeeping and supervision requirements, and are ordered to engage in specified remedial undertakings.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The orders find TD Bank from at least 2015 to the present, and Cowen from at least 2019 to February 2024, failed to stop employees, including those at senior levels, from communicating using unapproved communication methods, including messages sent via personal text. The firms were required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firms&rsquo; CFTC-registered businesses.&nbsp;These written communications generally were not maintained and preserved by the firms, and neither firm generally would have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each order further finds the use of unapproved communication methods violated each firm&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures, which generally prohibited business-related communication taking place via unapproved methods. Further, some of the same supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with the firms&rsquo; policies and procedures also used non-approved methods of communication to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy.</p>
<p>Since December 2021, the CFTC has imposed $1.202 billion in civil monetary penalties on 24 financial institutions for their use of unapproved methods of communication, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8470-21">8470-21</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8599-22">8599-22</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8699-23">8699-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8701-23">8701-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">8762-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8763-23">8763-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8794-23">8794-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8880-24">8880-24</a>]</p>
<p>Related Civil Actions</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission also announced today its filing and settling charges against affiliates of TD Bank and Cowen, and imposing civil monetary penalties for recordkeeping and supervision violations related to the use of unapproved methods of communication.</p>

<p>The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff responsible for these actions are Penina Moisa; Andrew Rodgers; Devin Cain; Alejandra de Urioste; R. Stephen Painter, Jr.; Lenel Hickson, Jr.; and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

<title>US Treasury Unveils New CFIUS Enforcement Website To Provide Further Clarity And Transparency Regarding CFIUS Penalties And Other Enforcement Actions - In 2023 And To Date In 2024, CFIUS Has Issued Three Times More Penalties Than It Had In The Previous Nearly 50-Years Since Its Establishment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, in a continuing evolution and sharpening of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as a critical national security tool, and in furtherance of greater transparency, the Treasury Department updated the CFIUS website to share more details and guidance with the public and the investing community about how CFIUS approaches compliance and enforcement, as well as a list of its penalty actions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Grace And Grit, Remarks Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, Recipient Of The 2024 Belva Ann Lockwood Award, The George Washington University Law School And Law Association Of Women</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span>Thank you so very much for this incredible honor, and to everyone who is here today. It really means a lot to me. I want to thank The George Washington University Law School, Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew, Associate Dean Rosa Celario and Professor Dalia Mitchell, the Law Association of Women and Gavi Kalaga and Shelby Amato, and of course the Belva Ann Lockwood Society for the very kind introductions, for this award and recognition, and for providing a forum to lift up women in law. I am grateful to you all for your commitment to telling our story and celebrating women&rsquo;s achievements. It is truly humbling to be this year&rsquo;s honoree for reflecting the character, determination, and attributes of Belva Ann Lockwood&mdash;GW Law&rsquo;s first alumna, a suffragette and leader for women&rsquo;s rights, the first woman to argue a case before the Supreme Court of the United States, and a U.S. Presidential candidate in 1884 and 1888. Undoubtedly, she accomplished all these &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; with both grace and grit while staying true to her values and beliefs.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It is a tremendous honor to be in the storied company of Belva Ann Lockwood and the women trailblazers who are past recipients of this award. I am particularly awed by some of my fellow regulators who have been recognized. I would first like to note that I am not the first U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recipient of this prestigious award. Mary Schapiro, who was the Chairman of the CFTC from 1994 to 1996, is the first woman to chair the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the first person to chair the SEC and CFTC, and&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>person to lead both of those agencies as well as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). She is an incredible leader who left her mark on not only these venerable institutions, but also the markets through rapid changes and many challenges. Wilma Liebman chaired the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the second woman to hold that post. Margaret Richardson was also the second woman to helm the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Marybeth Peters served the public trust for a remarkable 45 years, including 16 years as the U.S. Register of Copyrights. And I am proud to be the first Vietnamese-American woman nominated by the President to a Senate-confirmed position in the executive branch of government. Today, as a recipient of the 2024 Belva Ann Lockwood Award, I am so honored to be counted among this truly inspiring group of women.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would not be here today if it were not for the support of those near and dear to me, many of whom are in the audience. I want to thank my team who enables me to do my job every day&mdash;Meghan Tente, Harry Jung, Taylor Foy, Nick Elliot, former team member Keaghan Ames, and one of our current GW Law interns, Eryn Lin. Thank you to my mentors, friends, classmates, and former colleagues that are also here, including my former GW Law mentees. I am especially grateful that my parents were able to make the trip from California to be here. I have my family to thank for instilling the values of hard work, excellence, and integrity throughout my life. I am sure that these values contributed to Belva Ann Lockwood&rsquo;s success as she blazed a trail for all women, and particularly those of us passionate about the law and public service.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I hope that my story shows the power of hope and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving your goals. Almost 50 years ago, my parents were airlifted by helicopter from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon on the last day of the Vietnam War, April 30, 1975. They left behind everything they had to start over in a new country and create a better future for their children. In the face of these challenges, my family resolved to write their own story, which of course required perseverance, resilience, and a healthy dose of optimism. I have been so impressed by their success and their civic leadership in our local community. My parents instilled in me a deep sense of service and giving back, and that is why I am able to stand here in front of you today.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As a young child growing up in Modesto, California in the &lsquo;80s, I was often the only Asian-American in my classes and definitely the only child of refugees from an unpopular war. This brought its own challenges, but it also taught me important lessons about strength and independence. I decided early on that the best way to overcome challenges as a young woman of color was to outwork and outperform, and to do so with the highest level of integrity. I am blessed to have been raised by such great role models, who taught me how to navigate adversity with grace and grit. And I am grateful for the support of my brothers who always pushed me and supported me along the way.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>These lessons served me well in school at UCLA and right here at GW Law. It was a challenge starting law school by taking night classes while I worked full-time during the day. I want to give a shout-out to the other members of Section 21 who have risen to incredible professional accomplishments, in the White House, as partners at law firms, and in all their endeavors.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Law school is a wonderful time, but it too can be full of challenges. Many of you in this room are in the process of preparing for the rest of your lives. The decisions you make today can determine career paths for a lifetime. Maybe you are juggling classes and a job or a child or other responsibilities. In these challenging moments, it can start to feel overwhelming. That is where strong support systems come in. Student organizations like the Law Association of Women are essential to providing such a network. Rarely does anyone make it to the top by themselves&mdash;it takes a team. Lean on your family, friends, teachers, mentors, classmates, and colleagues, because we are all on this journey together.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Take advantage of the opportunities of going to law school here in Washington, like having internships in the federal government and having a front-row seat to policymaking. It was incredible for me to go to law school during the 2008 financial crisis and do research right here at GW Law on the Dodd-Frank Act&mdash;the greatest piece of financial regulatory reform our country has seen since the Great Depression.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I want to recognize and thank two of my GW Law professors that shaped my career and to whom I am forever grateful. Professor Art Wilmarth taught banking law and encouraged me to seek a career in financial regulation. He was a true leader in the faculty and as the executive director for the Center for Law, Economics, and Finance (C-LEAF), which I became involved in as a law student and later as a visiting fellow. Professor John Buchman was an adjunct professor and a former advisory board chair who was a big supporter of C-LEAF and his students. The annual GW Law Dodd-Frank Symposium featured prominently in thought leadership on financial regulatory reform, and one of the highlights for me was when I met former Fed Chair Paul Volcker and he also encouraged me to pursue public service.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I complemented my law school education with internships at the CFTC and SEC in the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Enforcement &amp; Compliance Division to see laws and regulations put into action, in addition to my time at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Then, I interned during my last year of law school for former CFTC Commissioner Scott O&rsquo;Malia, later returning as special counsel. I worked on some of the CFTC&rsquo;s most consequential rulemakings to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule and the first comprehensive regulatory framework for swaps. These sweeping regulations impact not just U.S. markets, but they also impact and shape global markets. My experiences at the CFTC were the inflection point for my entire career, and I want to thank Commissioner O&rsquo;Malia for the opportunity to learn about the lasting impact of policy decisions and putting the public interest first.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Fast forward to my career in the legal and financial services fields&mdash;professions that have their own history and challenges when it comes to women leaders and people of color. I have found that the lessons from my childhood continue to serve me well today.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Hard work. Excellence. Integrity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>These values can help you to achieve your personal ambitions. Whether it is in school or your career, I encourage you to look at every challenge as an opportunity to achieve new heights, even if they seem unobtainable. But it is not always about you or me. Sharing these values can have a compounding effect on the world around us. Belva Ann Lockwood was dedicated to using her talents as a teacher and as a legal scholar to recognize injustice around her and to do something about it. To speak up for what is right. To lead by example, and to inspire others.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>That is why I have made it a focus in all of my leadership roles to share my experiences and mentor a younger generation&mdash;at GW Law, the American Bar Association, Citigroup, and now at the CFTC. It is so important that we as leaders set a high bar when it comes to our organization&rsquo;s culture: one that is open-minded, encourages participation, and celebrates diversity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I encourage you to know your core values and always commit to doing the right thing, no matter how challenging it may be. Do it with grace and grit, and this foundation will take you far. In the face of adversity, your first principles will serve as a north star. And combined with hope and perseverance, I believe you can open doors that were once locked for generations.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>No doubt the world is a much different place since Belva Ann Lockwood broke glass ceiling after glass ceiling. Just look at the CFTC. Women on the Commission outnumber the men 4-to-1! I am grateful to work with such dedicated public servants and want to recognize Commissioner Mersinger, Commissioner Goldsmith Romero, Commissioner Johnson, and Chairman Behnam.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We are all better off thanks to the women who came before us, but that does not mean we cannot aim higher. We should always strive for greater fairness and greater opportunity for women. We can always do better to celebrate our differences.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You all have the gift of going to law school in our Nation&rsquo;s capital and witnessing history in the making. The education and experiences you gain today will enable your success in the future. I cannot wait to see what you accomplish&mdash;with grace and grit.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>SIFMA: Court Strikes Down Missouri Rules That Violate Federal Law And Grants Statewide Permanent Injunction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> ruling, SIFMA, Missouri, investment, financial<br />
<br />
Summary: SIFMA won a court ruling against Missouri's disclosure and consent rules for financial professionals, deeming them unconstitutional and preempted by federal laws. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today a federal court in Missouri issued a final ruling in favor of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) on its legal challenge to two newly enacted Missouri disclosure and consent rules.</p>
<p>The rules required financial professionals who consider &ldquo;a social objective or other nonfinancial objective&rdquo; in their investment advice to disclose this to their customers and obtain the customers&rsquo; written consent to state-mandated language in the rules. The rules characterized a &ldquo;nonfinancial&rdquo; objectives as anything other than maximal &ldquo;financial return,&rdquo; and the court agreed with SIFMA that the rules could easily be read to encompass objectives that are routinely part of investment decisions, such as tax considerations, diversification, risk tolerance, time horizon, liquidity needs, faith or values-based objectives, and local community investment objectives, among others.</p>
<p>The court ruled in favor of SIFMA on all counts. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that &ldquo;the Rules are preempted by [National Securities Markets Improvements Act (NSMIA)] and [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)], are unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and are impermissibly vague under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.&rdquo; The court also ordered a statewide permanent injunction prohibiting the implementation, application, or enforcement of the rules.</p>
<p>SIFMA&rsquo;s President and CEO, Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., remarked: &ldquo;Congress enacted NSMIA to alleviate the redundant, costly, and ineffective dual federal/state regulation of our securities market system. Today&rsquo;s ruling was necessary to prevent Missouri from violating NSMIA, among other things, and from hindering communications between Missouri investors and the financial professionals who serve them. This decision marks a major victory not only for our national securities market system, but also for our nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bentsen continued: &ldquo;Under today&rsquo;s federal securities laws, financial professionals are already required to provide investment advice and recommendations that are in their customers&rsquo; best interest. That means they cannot put their interests ahead of their customers&rsquo; interests when recommending securities. The Missouri rules were thus unnecessary and created confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<div> position limits, Vitol, CFTC, enforcement, penalty
Summary:
The CFTC orders Vitol to pay a penalty for exceeding position limits on crude oil and live cattle futures contracts. <div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Vitol, Inc.</span>, based in Houston, Texas, and its affiliate,&nbsp;<span>Vitol SA</span>, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland<span>&nbsp;</span>(collectively Vitol)<span>&nbsp;</span>for exceeding the CFTC&rsquo;s position limits on aggregate positions across multiple exchanges in contracts that reference crude oil futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and for exceeding the CFTC&rsquo;s position limits in live cattle futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The order requires Vitol to pay a $500,000 civil monetary penalty.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">This marks the CFTC&rsquo;s first use of its authority to enforce position limits on aggregate positions held on multiple exchanges. In addition to imposing a penalty, the order requires Vitol to cease and desist from further violations of Sections 4a(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulation 150.2, as charged.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">&ldquo;Federal position limits are important and are in place to prevent this sort of manipulation,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action shows the CFTC will use its ability to look at positions on and across exchanges to enforce compliance and protect the integrity of the futures markets.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The CFTC established federal speculative position limits for certain physical-delivery referenced contracts, including the NYMEX Physically Settled West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil contract (CL). For financially-settled options referencing the CL contract, applicable positions are determined by converting the options into their futures equivalents and aggregating those equivalents across a firm&rsquo;s various positions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The order finds on May 17, 2022, Vitol held positions in financially-settled calendar spread options traded on NYMEX and ICE Futures Energy Division (IFED) exchanges that referenced the CL contract equivalent to 7,484 CL contracts, 1,484 contracts over the federal speculative limit of 6,000. On May 18, 2022, Vitol held a position equivalent of 7,091 contracts, 2,091 contracts over that day&rsquo;s federal speculative limit of 5,000. On June 15, 2022, Vitol held a position equivalent to 6,074 contracts, 74 contracts over the federal speculative limit of 6,000. And on June 16, 2022, Vitol held a position equivalent to 6,594, 1,594 contracts over that day&rsquo;s federal speculative limit of 5,000.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The order also finds on December 5, 2022, Vitol held 771 December 2022 CME Live Cattle Futures contracts. The position exceeded by 171 the federal spot month speculative position limit of 600 contracts.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Trevor Kokal, Michael P. Geiser, Carrie Kennedy, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<div> harmonised rules, collateral management, Eurosystem, credit operations, capital markets union
Summary: 
The ECB published harmonised rules for collateral management in Eurosystem credit operations, reflecting changes in policy, market standards, and operational methods. These will take effect with the launch of the Eurosystem Collateral Management System. <div>
<ul>
<li>Harmonised rules and arrangements defined for mobilisation and management of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations</li>
<li>Harmonisation marks step towards European capital markets union</li>
<li>New rules take effect with launch of Eurosystem Collateral Management System, scheduled for 18 November 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk171611999"></a>harmonised rules and arrangements for the mobilisation and management of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations marking a step towards further financial integration in the euro area and the capital markets union.</p>
<p>The new rules and arrangements can be found in the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/legal/ecb.leg_gui_2024_22.en.pdf">guideline on the management of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations (ECB/2024/22)</a>, which the ECB published today. A&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.collateralmanagementeurosystemcreditoperations~cc619a1ab1.en.pdf">document</a>&nbsp;containing further information for Eurosystem counterparties on the harmonised processes, procedures and arrangements involved in the mobilisation and management of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations is also available on the ECB&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>The General Documentation has been&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/legal/ecb.leg_gui_2024_23.en.pdf">amended</a>&nbsp;to take account of Guideline ECB/2024/22.</p>
<p>The Eurosystem&rsquo;s harmonised rules and arrangements and the amendments to the General Documentation will come into effect with the launch of the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS), which is planned for 18 November 2024. The ECMS is a unified system for managing assets mobilised as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. It will replace the existing individual collateral management systems belonging to the national central banks of the euro area countries.</p>
<h2>Annex</h2>
<p>The harmonised rules and arrangements for the mobilisation and management of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations reflect the following developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the implementation of a Eurosystem policy establishing that assets mobilised as collateral will be held in accounts in TARGET2-Securities (T2S);</li>
<li>the adoption of market standards relevant for Eurosystem collateral management, as set out in the Single Collateral Management Rulebook for Europe (SCoRE);</li>
<li>updates to the eligibility criteria applicable to securities settlement systems (SSSs), links between SSSs and triparty agents (TPAs);</li>
<li>the alignment of domestic and cross-border handling procedures;</li>
<li>the implementation of a single operational method &ndash; pooling &ndash; for maintaining collateral mobilised by Eurosystem counterparties;</li>
<li>the adoption of a harmonised approach for recovering external costs charged by central securities depositories (CSDs) and TPAs from counterparties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Documentation has been amended to take account of Guideline ECB/2024/22 and implements certain other changes relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the prioritisation of credit assessments from the national central banks&rsquo; in-house credit assessment systems (ICASs), where available, over those from other credit assessment systems for the provision of credit assessment of debtors and guarantors of credit claims used to determine the eligibility of the credit claim and the applicable valuation haircuts;</li>
<li>the provision of greater clarity in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF) with regard to the acceptance of local currency and foreign currency ratings from external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs);</li>
<li>the expression in face amount (FAMT) of the quantity of debt instruments to be eligible as collateral and comply with market standards for the denomination of securities.</li>
</ul>

<title>SEC Charges Russell Todd Burkhalter And His Atlanta-Based Firm With $300 Million Ponzi Scheme And Obtains Emergency Relief - Burkhalter Allegedly Stole Investor Funds To Buy A $3.1 Million Yacht And Fund Lavish Lifestyle</title>

<div> Ponzi scheme, SEC, asset freeze, real estate, injunction
Summary: SEC halts $300 million real estate Ponzi scheme, freezes assets of Drive Planning LLC and CEO, who misappropriated funds. Receiver appointed. Investors impacted. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained a preliminary injunction, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against Atlanta-based Drive Planning LLC and its founder and CEO, Russell Todd Burkhalter, to halt a $300 million real estate Ponzi scheme impacting more than 2,000 investors. Additionally, a receiver was appointed over Drive Planning. The SEC alleges the defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds to fund Burkhalter&rsquo;s lavish lifestyle and to make Ponzi-like payments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive Planning and Burkhalter gained the trust of everyday people and encouraged them to invest in this scheme by promising exorbitant returns, but as our complaint alleges, the defendants&rsquo; business was nothing more than a classic Ponzi scheme, using new investor money to pay returns to existing investors, with Burkhalter stealing millions to fund a lavish lifestyle,&rdquo; said Nekia Hackworth Jones, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Atlanta Regional Office. &ldquo;Investors should be vigilant when they encounter aggressive sellers who make over-the-top sales pitches and promise high rates of guaranteed returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that, from 2020 through at least June 2024, Drive Planning and Burkhalter raised more than $300 million for purported real estate investments, telling investors their money would be used to fund land development projects. The defendants promised 10% interest every 3 months and encouraged investors to tap their savings, retirement accounts, and even open lines of credit to invest. In reality, the defendants did not have a business capable of generating the promised returns, and they instead used investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments, according to the complaint. The complaint further alleges that Burkhalter stole investor funds to fund his luxurious lifestyle, including to buy a $3.1 million yacht and spending $4.6 million on chartering private jets and luxury car services and $2 million on a luxury condo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Drive Planning and Burkhalter with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to the emergency relief granted by the Court, which the defendants did not oppose, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants, and an officer-and-director bar against Burkhalter.&nbsp;The complaint also names Jacqueline Burkhalter, Burkhalter&rsquo;s spouse, and several related entities as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Austin Stephenson and Cody Turley, under the supervision of Peter Diskin and Justin Jeffries, of the SEC&rsquo;s Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Pat Huddleston and H.B. Roback, under the supervision of M. Graham Loomis.</p>

<div> July, CUSIP, issuance, corporate, municipal
<br /><br />Summary:
July CUSIP issuance report shows a slowdown in new corporate and municipal identifiers. Year-over-year, international debt requests are up significantly. <div>
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=76m1CH5vMIGg2YzJcCJs12ebizRAvUb_9k1sP1qs3KALvPiYomf64Cwii8m2Hcrj53lC4Ne23uNAEe3gjiFA0KHfxq-8cOHohMpN0VYcuHHXYEYQIeJmyGJUzRewRtMn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CUSIP Global Services</span></a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for July 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a slowdown in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers for a second consecutive month.</p>
<p align="start">North American corporate requests totaled 6,391 in July, which is down 2.6% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 7.9%. The monthly volume decline was driven by a 15.6% decrease in request volume for U.S. corporate debt and a 21.1% decrease in volume for Canadian corporate securities. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-10.1%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-10.2%) also slowed in July.</p>
<p align="start">The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 18.1% versus June totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 7.6%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 180 new CUSIP requests in July, followed by New York (161) and California (67).</p>
<p align="start">&ldquo;While new issuance volume is still up year-over-year across the majority of asset classes, we are starting to see more frequent slowdowns on a month-to-month basis,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;The jury is still out on whether that monthly volatility represents a significant trend or just a mid-summer blip in activity. We will continue to monitor CUSIP request volumes closely for any signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="start">Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 1.7% in July and international debt CUSIP requests rose 14.8%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 4.8% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 113.3%.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines And Bans Martin Sarl For Dishonest And Reckless Conduct</title>

<div> banned, financial services, dishonesty, client money, insurance<br />
Summary:<br />
Martin Sarl banned from financial services for misuse of client money, leaving customers uninsured and lying to cover it up. Firm entered liquidation. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has banned Martin Sarl from working in the financial services industry and fined him &pound;5,021 for acting without honesty and integrity.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between 7 November 2017 and 24 October 2019, Mr Sarl, who was the sole director at Perry Prowse (Insurance Consultants) Ltd, failed to pass clients&rsquo; premiums to insurers, meaning that some customers were left uninsured without their knowledge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA's investigation uncovered that Mr Sarl used money from the firm&rsquo;s client account to pay both his personal debt, and that of the firm. That was not allowed under the FCA&rsquo;s Client Money rules, and these funds should have been kept separate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, there was not enough money to transfer the premiums - that his customers had paid to him - to insurers, leaving customers without cover and at risk of having their home, and car insurance claims rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he was asked questions by customers about their insurance, Mr Sarl hid the truth, even going as far as blaming a false 'IT glitch'. In at least one instance, a customer had a claim rejected because they did not have cover in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint head of Enforcement and Market oversight at the FCA said</span>:</p>
<p>'Mr Sarl's customers trusted him to keep their money safe and to secure the insurance cover they needed. Instead he helped himself to prop up his business and personal finances. He compounded this by lying to his customers.</p>
<p>'This left many people at risk of being unable to make a claim should they have needed to. It is right that Mr Sarl should be banned from the industry'.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/martin-christopher-sarl-2024.pdf" title="martin-christopher-sarl-2024.pdf">Final Notice 2024: Martin Christopher Sarl (PDF)</a></li>
<li>The FCA has imposed a financial penalty on Mr Sarl for &pound;5,021 for his failure to comply with Statement of Principle 1 pursuant to section 66 of the Act. Mr Sarl&rsquo;s penalty was reduced from &pound;63,600 as Mr Sarl provided evidence that the payment of &pound;63,600 would cause him serious financial hardship. The penalty was reduced to &pound;5,021 as this is the amount that Authority considers was the financial benefit derived directly from his breaches and it would not be appropriate to allow him to retain this benefit.</li>
<li>As a result of the actions of Mr Sarl, the FCA finds that he is not a fit and proper person to perform any function in relation to any regulated activities carried on by any authorised or exempt person or exempt professional firm, and the FCA withdraws the approval for Mr Sarl to perform the function of SMF3 Executive Director at Perry Prowse.</li>
<li>On 13 September 2019, the FCA took action to vary Perry Prowse&rsquo;s permission to remove all of its regulated activities with immediate effect. On 15 January 2020, the firm entered into liquidation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The customer whose insurance claim was refused because they did not have insurance in place was later reimbursed through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</li>
<li>The Client Money Rules require firms to calculate the amount of client money that should be segregated in a separate client bank account. Firms must segregate the client money until the premium is either paid to the insurer or client money is paid out to a client.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms must always hold the right amount of client money in a segregated client bank account to avoid a shortfall occurring. The FCA continues to take failures to segregate appropriately seriously as this action shows.</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines FXTB For Unfair Customer Treatment Practices</title>

<div> CFD, FXTB, FCA, fine, investment advice
<br />
FXTB fined £276,100 by FCA for pressuring customers into CFD trading, providing unauthorized investment advice, and exploiting inexperienced traders.<br /><br />Summary: The FCA fined FXTB for pressuring customers into CFD trading, providing unauthorized investment advice, and exploiting inexperienced traders, resulting in a £276,100 fine. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Cypriot contract for differences (CFD) firm Forex TB Limited (FXTB) &pound;276,100 for failing to treat its customers fairly, and for providing investment advice without being authorised to do so.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>CFDs are complex leveraged financial products used to speculate on the movement in prices on a wide range of assets. As a result, they carry a considerable risk of substantial losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FXTB pressured customers to put their money at risk through CFD trading, even encouraging them to borrow money from friends or family in some cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compounding these failings, FXTB frequently provided its customers with investment advice, despite not being authorised to do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FXTB&rsquo;s customers were inexperienced in trading and did not always understand the risks associated with CFDs, which were also not fully explained to them. FXTB also enabled customers to become 'Professional Clients' by encouraging them to provide false information. This meant these consumers lost the protections that as &lsquo;retail clients&rsquo; they would have had. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA required FXTB to stop providing services to UK consumers on 12 April 2021. No business in the UK has been conducted by FXTB since this date. From 10 October 2023, FXTB no longer held any FCA permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said</span>: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'FXTB&rsquo;s misconduct was particularly egregious since it relied on the exploitation of customers who, because of their inexperience, were particularly vulnerable. By intervening early in April 2021, we helped prevent further consumer losses.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA would have imposed a fine of &pound;1.215m, however FXTB demonstrated that this would cause it serious financial hardship.&nbsp;</p>

<li>FXTB also traded as Patron FX.</li>
<li>The FCA encourages any customer of FXTB who believes they experienced behaviour as set out in the Final Notice to make a complaint to FXTB as a means of seeking compensation.</li>
<li>The FCA has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-bars-cypriot-firms-used-unauthorised-celebrity-endorsements" title="FCA bars Cypriot firms that used unauthorised celebrity endorsements">taken action</a>&nbsp;in 2020 to stop 4 Cypriot investment firms from continuing to offer high risk CFDs to UK investors. Moreover, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-places-restrictions-twice-many-consumer-investment-firms-year" title="FCA places restrictions on twice as many consumer investment firms this year">stopped</a>&nbsp;the UK operations of a further 16 CFD providers that had entered the UK&rsquo;s temporary permissions regime in 2021.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the context of CFDs, a client opting up to Professional Client status is able to trade on higher leverage / put up less margin to support a position of a given size. This increases potential profits but also potential losses. Clients moving to Professional Client status waive some protections afforded to retail clients.</li>

<title>ACER To Decide On Amending The Methodology For Harmonising Cross-Zonal Electricity Balancing Capacity Allocation</title>

<div> methodology, cross-zonal capacity, balancing capacity, TSOs, ACER
Summary: 
ACER received a request to amend the methodology for cross-zonal capacity allocation to integrate balancing capacity markets, lower costs, and ensure supply security. Stakeholder consultation and decision-making will follow.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>On 31 July 2024, ACER received a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXUFcCV1RRBkwIBAcAHVYJBw4dCggJVRoCBwAEUQNXBg9XVQIdVlFSWAwABgIdA10MAB0GCQQFGlddAgcZVQFUAwUFAFEDVlZSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>&nbsp;from Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBCFdSWAQFV0xYU1ZRHVYLBQIdCgEFABoHA1EFUlYBDwdQA1IdVlFSWAwABgIdA10MAB0GCQQFGlddAgcZVQFUAwUFAFEDVlZSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">harmonised methodology for cross-zonal capacity allocation for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>This methodology provides a harmonised approach for effective allocation of cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves. Having an optimised allocation of cross-zonal capacity is important to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foster the integration of balancing capacity markets.</li>
<li>Lower the costs of procuring balancing capacity (hence the costs for tariff payers).</li>
<li>Ensure the security of electricity supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the methodology?</span></p>

<p>Highlighting the month's performance, Croatia's Zagrebacka Burza dd emerged as the standout player, achieving a remarkable 31.9% increase in share price from July 1 to July 31, 2024. Nasdaq followed suit with a 12.5% rise, while Israel's Tel Aviv Stock Exchange enjoyed an 11.5% increase during the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Conversely, Poland's Warsaw Stock Exchange faced challenges, recording the steepest decline with an 11.3% drop in share prices. The Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB de CV saw an 8.1% decrease, and Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing experienced a 7.4% decline.</p>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index commented on the competitive landscape: "LSEG, whose shares have increased by 2.9% this year, is steadily closing the gap with ICE and CME in the race to become the leading exchange by market cap. The collaboration between LSEG and Microsoft is anticipated to yield significant results by year-end."</p>

<title>ASIC Sues ASX For Alleged Misleading Statements</title>

<div> proceedings, Federal Court, ASX Limited, misleading statements, ASIC <br />
Summary:<br />
ASIC alleges ASX made misleading statements about the CHESS replacement project, causing significant costs and lack of confidence in the market. ASX paid a penalty of $1,050,000. <div>
<p>ASIC has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Australia&rsquo;s largest market operator, ASX Limited, for allegedly making misleading statements related to its Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) replacement project.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges statements made in ASX announcements on 10 February 2022 that the project remained &ldquo;on-track for go-live&rdquo; in April 2023 and was &ldquo;progressing well&rdquo; were misleading.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges these statements implied the project was tracking to ASX&rsquo;s announced project plan and was on track to meet future milestones, including &ldquo;go-live&rdquo; in April 2023. ASIC alleges those representations were misleading and deceptive because, at the time of the announcements, the project was not tracking to plan and ASX did not have any reasonable basis to imply the project was on track to meet future milestones.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;ASX&rsquo;s statements go to the heart of trust in the integrity of our markets. We believe this was a collective failure by the ASX Board and senior executives at the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Companies and market participants rely on what the ASX says about its operations to make their own decisions and investments. We expect the ASX to be a place to list and invest with confidence. When the ASX falls short, it has wide ranging consequences across the market.</p>
<p>Mr Longo said ASX&rsquo;s CHESS replacement is a technology project of fundamental significance, replacing critical national infrastructure crucial to the operation of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Its critical importance was all the more reason ASX needed to ensure it told the Australian public the truth about how the project was tracking and whether it would be completed on time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We allege that the true state of affairs as at 10 February 2022 was that the project was not &ldquo;progressing well&rdquo;, contrary to ASX&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The delay and subsequent pause of the project in November 2022 caused significant cost to ASX and market participants who relied on assurances as to the progress of the project and scheduled go-live date.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The CHESS replacement project must be managed effectively and transparently. Failure to do so can lead to a lack of confidence in Australia as a market to attract investment,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>ASIC is yet to determine the penalty it will seek for ASX's alleged contraventions.</p>
<p>On 7 March 2024, ASIC announced ASX had paid a penalty of $1,050,000 following an ASIC investigation into its compliance with the market integrity rules. More recently, ASIC took action against a &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; scheme and attempted manipulation of commodities markets. These proceedings underscore ASIC's commitment to ensuring all market participants comply with the law.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Ensuring the ASX has complied, and is complying, with its legal obligations is critically important to maintaining confidence in the integrity of the market given the important role ASX plays in developing and issuing recommendations on the corporate governance practices to be adopted by listed companies and is responsible for the governance of critical national infrastructure.</p>
<p>On 28 March 2022, approximately six weeks after making the statements, ASX announced that there was a strong likelihood of further delay to the go-live date of April 2023. Following that announcement, ASX engaged Accenture to undertake a review of the project.</p>
<p>That review identified significant challenges with the solution design and its ability to meet the ASX&rsquo;s requirements. Following the release of the Accenture Report, ASX decided to pause the project and wrote down costs of $250 million.</p>

<p>Chances are you may be watching this video because an AI-powered search algorithm suggested it to you.</p>
<p>How might similar algorithms affect your investment choices?</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is about using math, using data, using computational power to recognize patterns and make predictions.</p>
<p>Companies now can use it to narrow-cast in other words, to individually target or personalize a message, pricing, or products to each of us individually. In finance, robo-advisors and brokerage applications are using such algorithms.</p>
<p>Already we receive messages from AI-recommender systems, whether in finance or elsewhere, that are considering how we might as individuals respond to their prompts, respond to their products, respond to their pricing.</p>
<p>We all know some forms of these predictive data analytics well, it's all around us. The flashing buttons on our screen, the push notifications, the colors, the sounds, the well engineered subtleties of our modern digital life. If finance platforms figured out something else subtle about us, let's say maybe our color preferences.</p>
<p>Little story from my youth: my mom used to dress my identical twin brother Rob in red and me, Gary in green. Yeah, it's it's real. It's true. Today, I might not react as favorably to green prompts.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence systems can pick up on these subtle preferences. If their optimization function takes the interest of the platform, the robo-advisor, the brokerage app, into consideration as well as the interest of a customer this can lead to conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Well, in finance, when brokers or advisers act on those conflicts, and if they optimize to place their interest ahead of their investor&rsquo;s interest, investors may suffer financial harm.</p>
<p>Are investment firms sending me alerts that aren't green because somehow they&rsquo;ve figured out, that I might react in a different way, or because it might benefit the firm's revenues, profits or other interest at my expense?</p>
<p>Those who provide financial advice and recommendations, whether or not based on artificial intelligence, are still required to serve the best interest of the clients and retail customers.</p>
<p>We at the Securities and Exchange Commission are focused on how evolving artificial intelligence affects investors, affects issuers and the markets connecting them. That's why we proposed a rule last year regarding how best to address potential conflicts across a range of investor interactions, from robo-advisors to brokers.</p>

<div> Telecommunications, Nigeria, Economic growth, Capital market, Investment <br />
The telecommunications sector in Nigeria plays a vital role in the economy, requiring supportive policies, investments in infrastructure, and talent development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Industry leaders highlighted the telecommunications sector as a pivotal force in Nigeria's economic growth at a recent town hall event organized by Financial Derivatives Company (FDC). The event, themed "Telecoms Industry 2.0: The Next Investment Frontier in Nigeria," brought together key stakeholders to discuss the industry's critical role in shaping the future of the Nigerian capital market.</p>
<p>Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), underscored the significant impact of the telecommunications industry on capital market efficiency, transparency, and financial inclusion. "The telecommunications sector is not just about connectivity; it is a vital cog in the machinery that drives market transparency and informed decision-making," Popoola stated. He pointed out that two of the top five most capitalized companies on NGX are telecommunications giants, illustrating the deep-seated connection between the industry and the financial market.</p>
<p>Popoola emphasized that the influence of telecoms extends well beyond their primary services. "Their contributions extend beyond connectivity; they facilitate the dissemination of real-time market data, which is crucial for enhancing market transparency," he noted. He also discussed the synergistic relationship between the telecoms industry and the capital market, which fosters a robust ecosystem benefiting suppliers, partners, and investors.</p>
<p>The GMD/CEO stressed the importance of fostering an environment that encourages innovation, which he believes will drive further investment in infrastructure and talent development within the sector. He called for continued collaboration between the telecommunications industry and the financial markets to unlock new opportunities that would enhance both sectors.</p>
<p>Dr. Armstrong Takang, Managing Director/CEO of the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, represented the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy at the event. He echoed Popoola's sentiments, asserting the need for a supportive policy framework that could make the telecom industry even more attractive for investments. "With the right regulations and enabling policies, the telecommunications sector has the potential to become a cornerstone of Nigeria's economic future," Dr. Takang stated.</p>
<p>Adding to the discourse, Mr. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, called for a regulatory landscape that encourages telecom companies to leverage the capital markets. He stressed the importance of increased investments in infrastructure and a greater focus on talent development to ensure the industry's sustainable growth.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a consensus among stakeholders that a strategic mix of policies and enabling legislation will be vital in steering Nigeria's telecommunications industry towards long-term sustainability and making it a true investment frontier.</p>
<p>Telecommunications sector has been recognized as a significant contributor to Nigeria's economic growth since its liberalization in 2001. As the industry continues to evolve, its symbiotic relationship with the capital market and broader economy remains a focal point for policymakers and investors alike.</p>

<title>The EBA Sets 2025 Priorities For Resolution Authorities And Reports On The Progress Achieved In 2023</title>

<div> European Banking Authority, EREP Report, priorities, resolution authorities, banks <br />
Summary:<br />
The EBA published its EREP Report, setting priorities for resolution authorities and banks, including operationalizing resolution tools, liquidity strategies, and management information systems for valuation. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its European Resolution Examination Programme (EREP) Report. It sets three priorities for resolution authorities and banks for 2025: operationalisation of their resolution tools, liquidity strategies in resolution, and management information system for valuation. The Report also looks at the progress achieved in 2023 and identifies areas of improvement.</span></p>
<p>The 2025 EREP priorities confirm and complement the areas of focus set for 2024, given their relevance and the fact that work takes time on those complex topics. New elements introduced for 2025 reflect policy and market developments, progress and expertise gained by resolution authorities and, overall, embed a testing dimension which is considered central for resolution readiness.</p>
<p>Compared to 2024, building up own funds and eligible liabilities is not a separate priority anymore, given that most banks have met their minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). However, to increase the effectiveness of the bail-in tool, MREL qualitative aspects are to be further monitored as part of the operationalisation of resolution tools, and quantitative aspects will be followed and disclosed by the EBA in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/risk-analysis/risk-monitoring/mrel-dashboard">MREL Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>In 2023,&nbsp;convergence increased within the EU with regards to resolution planning practices and objectives.</p>
<p>On MREL, only four banks did not meet their target as of 1 January 2024. Resolution authorities have used their powers to impose sanctions and extended deadlines for 22&nbsp;institutions. They have also increased their monitoring of MREL eligibility and quality, especially for contracts governed by third-country law.</p>
<p>On the operationalisation of the bail-in tool, most&nbsp;resolution authorities have now published&nbsp;their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/resolution/guidelines-resolution-authorities-publication-their-approach-implementing-bail-tool">bail-in mechanics</a>&nbsp;and consider that challenges concerning the identification of holders of instruments, suspension for trading or requirements of issuing prospectus for the new instruments persist and are particularly prominent in relation to third country stakeholders.</p>
<p>While some progress has been observed in the area of liquidity in resolution, resolution authorities plan to further increase the intensity of their testing and to challenge the severity of banks&rsquo; scenarios.</p>
<p>Finally, resolution authorities have performed more testing of management information systems for valuation<span>&nbsp;</span>as some banks showed significant gaps in data quality, automation, granularity and timeliness of report delivery. Further progress remains needed. Resolution authorities have put in place procedures for quickly appointing a valuer. The EBA supports the work of resolution authorities and is preparing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-consults-handbook-independent-valuers-resolution-purposes">Handbook on the independence of valuers</a>&nbsp;currently under public consultation.</p>
<h5>Note to the editors</h5>
<p>According to Articles 25 and 29 of its founding Regulation, the EBA shall contribute to, and participate actively in, the development and coordination of effective, consistent and up-to-date recovery and resolution plans for financial institutions and shall also develop and maintain an up-to-date Union resolution handbook on the resolution of financial institutions in the Union.</p>
<p>The EBA fosters convergence in resolution practices by setting EREP priorities and publishing a report on an annual basis. The is the second edition of the EBA&rsquo;s EREP priorities and report.</p>
<p>The EREP priorities highlights the topics on which EU banks and resolution authorities need to pay special attention in the next calendar year. They are selected based on the expertise of the EBA and its members in policy development, on the practical experience of resolution authorities, and of the resolution colleges in which the EBA participates. The EBA subsequently assesses whether and how the selected topics have been taken into account in resolution authorities&rsquo; priorities and activities.</p>
<p>Separately, as part of its convergence mandate, the EBA sets priorities for banks and their supervisors on an annual basis in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/supervisory-convergence/european-supervisory-examination-programme-esep">European Supervisory Examination Programme (ESEP)</a>, which includes the key topics for heightened supervisory attention across the European Union. In addition, following the entry into force of the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, the EBA also set out&nbsp;<a href="">key topics for supervisory attention across the European Union&nbsp;in 2024/2025&nbsp;for issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs),</a>&nbsp;with the aim of promoting the timely and consistent application of MiCAR.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Final Draft Technical Standards On Market Risk As Part Of Its Roadmap For The Implementation Of The Banking Package In The EU</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> amendments, RTS, FRTB, CRR3, EBA
Summary: The EBA published final amendments to the RTS on FRTB to align with CRR3, including changes to profit and loss attribution test and risk factor modellability assessment. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published final amendments to its Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB). The revisions mostly aim to align these RTS with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and ensure stability in the applicable regulatory framework. The RTS are part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package"><span>roadmap on the Banking Package</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>The CRR3 introduced a number of changes to the FRTB and included mandates for the EBA to amend existing RTS for them to fit with the new Level 1 text. In particular, the EBA has been mandated to review the RTS on the treatment of foreign-exchange and commodity risk in the banking book, the RTS on profit and loss attribution test and the RTS on risk factor modellability assessment</p>
<p>As regards the details on the profit and loss attribution test, the RTS remove the aggregation formula for computing the total own funds requirements for market risk for an institution using the alternative internal model approach as this formula has been now introduced in the CRR3.</p>
<p>As regards the risk factors&rsquo; modellability assessment, the RTS ensure that institutions are able to identify how far they rely on a third-party vendor for the purpose of assessing the modellability of a risk factor.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the treatment of foreign exchange and commodity risk in the non-trading book, the RTS ensure that translation risk is duly captured by institutions.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>The draft RTS have been developed according to Article 325(9), 325be(3) and 325bg(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3, which mandates the EBA to specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>how institutions are to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign-exchange risk or commodity risk;</li>
<li>how institutions are to assess the risk factors&rsquo; modellability;</li>
<li>technical details relating to the profit and loss attribution tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EBA roadmap also outlines the EBA&rsquo;s intentions and plan of action to ensure a smooth implementation of the new approaches across the EU. In particular, it reflects the prioritisation of the EBA&rsquo;s work in four phases, which is broadly in line with the deadlines included in the CRR3, starting with the implementation of the essential parts of the framework.</p>

<div> Denmark, Portugal, Germany, Italy, macroprudential measures
<br />
FI reciprocates Denmark's 7% sectoral systemic risk buffer. It does not reciprocate similar measures in Portugal, Germany, and Italy. 
Summary: 
FI reciprocates Denmark's 7% buffer. It does not reciprocate Portugal's, Germany's, or Italy's measures due to insignificant Swedish exposures. <div>
<p><span>Finansinspektionen has passed decisions concerning reciprocation of macroprudential measures in Denmark, Portugal, Germany and Italy.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>FI has passed a decision to reciprocate The Ministry of industry's decision to implement a 7 percent sectoral systemic risk buffer for exposures to real estate companies in Denmark. In accordance with the threshold set by The Ministry of industry the decision applies to Swedish institutions where said exposures exceed EUR 200 billion. The decision will apply from the 31st of Oktober 2024.</p>
<p>In Portugal the central bank has passed a decision to introduce a systemic risk buffer of 4 percent for retail exposures to natural persons secured by residential immovable property for which the collateral is located in Portugal. The buffer applies to institutions using internal models (IRB institutions). FI has decided not to reciprocate the Portugal measure as Swedish IRB institutions relevant exposures are insignificant.</p>
<p>In Germany the supervisory authority (Bafin) has decided to maintain a 2 percent sectoral systemic risk buffer for retail exposures and corporate exposures secured by residential immovable property for which the collateral is located in Germany. FI has decided not to reciprocate the German measure as Swedish institutions relevant exposures are insignificant.</p>
<p>In Italy the central bank has passed a decision to introduce a systemic risk buffer of 7 percent for credit and counterparty credit risk exposures. FI has decided not to reciprocate the Italian measure as Swedish institutions relevant exposures are insignificant.</p>
<h2>Reciprocation of macroprudential measures in other countries</h2>
<p>According to the capital adequacy regulations (Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements Directive), a country can ask other countries to reciprocate adopted macroprudential measures. If Sweden decides to reciprocate another Member State's measures, this means that affected Swedish exposures in that country will be covered by the measure.</p>

<title>ESAs’ Joint Board Of Appeal Allows The Appeal Lodged By NOVIS And Remits The Case To EIOPA</title>

<div> admissible, appeal, documents, access, EIOPA
Summary:<br /> The Board found NOVIS's appeal admissible regarding access to documents from EIOPA, acknowledging exceptions but remitting the case for an amended decision. <div>
<div class="node__content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Joint Board of Appeal (&ldquo;The Board&rdquo;) of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the EBA, ESMA and EIOPA) unanimously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-08/BoA-D-2024-05_Board_of_Appeal_-_NOVIS_v_EIOPA_-_Decision.pdf">decided</a>&nbsp;that the appeal brought by NOVIS against the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is admissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The appeal was brought in relation to the EIOPA decision not to grant access to documents, which were requested by NOVIS.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its decision, the Board acknowledges that requests for access to documents laid out in Regulation No 1049/2001 can be dismissed by way of exceptions to protect certain public and private interests.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In the context of this appeal, the Board confirms that for certain documents targeted by NOVIS&rsquo; request, there may be good reasons to refuse access in order to protect the proper functioning of the European System of Financial Supervision (&ldquo;ESFS&rdquo;). The Board concurs with EIOPA that there must be a &ldquo;safe space&rdquo;, comprising all supervisory authorities that are part of the ESFS, where all potential options and ideas can be discussed freely without public disclosure. Nevertheless, the Board also concludes that for two documents, partial access may have been granted.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">As a result, the Board remits the case to EIOPA for the adoption of an amended decision.</p>

<div> Bitcoin, Ether, Spectrum Markets, SERIX sentiment, retail investors<br />
Summary:<br />
Bullish sentiment for Bitcoin and Ether, driven by political endorsements, Russian government decisions, ETF launches, and EIB's Ether-based bond issuance. Spectrum's SERIX data reveals retail investor sentiment. <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Markets&rsquo; SERIX sentiment shows a bullish trend for both Bitcoin and Ether, coinciding with price increases (BTC 59.728,2 EUR<sup>1</sup>; ETH 2.986,32 EUR<sup>2</sup>)</li>
<li>Endorsements from political figures such as Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with decisions by the Russian government, have boosted Bitcoin demand</li>
<li>Ether&rsquo;s rising demand is driven by increased institutional interest, including ETF launches and the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s (EIB) Ether-based bond issuance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for July, revealing a bullish trend for both cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether. The SERIX value for Bitcoin remained stable at a high level with 107 points (down from 108 on June), while the value for Ether increased from 110 to 113 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<h4>Market opinion</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The bullish trading behaviour, alongside rising prices in July &ndash; appears to be backed by recent statements from the U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who promised to transform the United States into a &lsquo;global crypto currency capital and bitcoin superpower&rsquo; with prospects of Bitcoin-friendly regulations if elected. Trump announced plans to stop selling confiscated Bitcoin stocks and establish a &lsquo;strategic Bitcoin reserve&rsquo;. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. went even further, advocating for the daily purchase of 550 Bitcoins by the U.S. government to fund a substantial Bitcoin reserve. Additionally, the Russian government&rsquo;s legalisation of Bitcoin for export trade payments to counteract Western sanctions has likely been seen by retail investors worldwide as a strong signal, potentially fueling demand. However, the abrupt drop in price of Bitcoin and Ether in early August, took many investors by surprise, highlighting once again the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market&rdquo;, says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In terms of Ether, the bullish sentiment may be driven by the approval of nine Ether ETFs, which began trading on July 23<sup>rd</sup>. The European Investment Bank&rsquo;s (EIB) issuance of its first digital bond also contributed as another factor. Despite Bitcoin's advancements, many investors tend to favour Ether due to technological improvements such as &lsquo;staking,&rsquo; which allows for dividend payments. Ether is increasingly significant in decentralised finance and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), lowering the barrier for gaming and social media applications. So, at the end there is a strong supportive story also for Ether&rdquo;, Hall concludes.</p>
<h4>Spectrum&rsquo;s July data</h4>
<p>In July 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;240.3 million, with 36.3% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 77.2% on indices, 3.6% on currency pairs, 8.7% on commodities, 7.7% on equities and 2.8% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (29.4%), DAX 40 (25.1%), and DOW 30 (12%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 dropped from a bullish sentiment to a neutral 100, while the NASDAQ 100 increased from a bearish 99 to a neutral 100 as well DOW 30 remained bearish at 96.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<span>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Trustly, open banking, UK market, payment volumes, partnerships<br />
<br />
Summary: Trustly's payment volumes in the UK soared to £13.1bn in the first half of 2024, showcasing the growing adoption of open banking technology and strengthening partnerships.<br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><b>Trustly processed payments to the value of more than &pound;13.1bn between January to June in 2024</b></li>
<li><b>This marks a considerable increase relative to 2023, when Trustly handled &pound;13.6bn over the full year</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>13 August 2024 &ndash; London:&nbsp;</b>Trustly, the global leader in open banking payments, is continuing to strengthen its presence in the UK, building its relationships with key partners as payment volumes and the adoption of open banking technology accelerates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trustly provides consumers and merchants with a suite of payment products and data solutions, which aim to make online payments seamless, instant and secure. The company has been growing rapidly since its launch in 2008, currently partnering with 9,000 businesses across 33 markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this country specifically, Trustly has seen tremendous growth in recent years with transaction value soaring in the first half of 2024 and exceeding &pound;13bn. This represents a significant increase in comparison to 2023 when the company handled &pound;13.6bn for the entire year. Trustly&rsquo;s strong performance highlights the growing adoption of open banking more broadly, with one in nine people in the UK reportedly using open banking services as of October 2023<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trustly has been successful in developing its connections and partnerships across both the public and private sectors. The company&rsquo;s positive results demonstrate a clear acceleration in the adoption of open banking in the United Kingdom, with Trustly enabling organisations to enhance services for the country&rsquo;s consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trustly continues to strengthen its partnerships in the private sector, such as with Hargreaves Lansdown, ITV, MoneyGram and Booking.com. The acquisition of Ecospend, A Trustly Company, in 2023 has contributed to increasing Trustly&rsquo;s presence in the UK and rise of its market share.</p>
<p><b>Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond MBE, a Senior Adviser to Trustly, comments:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It is exciting to see Trustly continue to expand its presence in the UK market. The strength of Trustly&rsquo;s partnerships across the private and public sector combined with the business&rsquo; exceptionally strong performance in recent months emphasises the accelerating adoption of open banking technology among consumers and merchants across the UK. The entire team at Trustly looks forward to continuing to provide our UK-based customers and partners with innovative payment solutions as we work towards making open banking payments a standard part of financial experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a strategic move to bolster its presence in the UK market, Trustly has appointed Mitchell Powers as Senior Vice President for the UK. Powers joins Trustly from GoCardless, where he most recently served as Vice President and General Manager. This appointment underscores Trustly's commitment to expanding its footprint and enhancing its service offerings in the UK.</p>
<p><b>Mitchell Powers, Senior Vice President at Trustly UK, comments:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Joining Trustly, the outright leader in this industry, is a proud moment for me. The company has gone from strength to strength over the past 12 months. This is demonstrated by its tremendous growth, world-first product rollouts, and innovative solutions for major global brands. I'm excited to be joining Trustly for its vision, its clear differentiators and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; its potential to completely revolutionise the way people pay for things in the United Kingdom. Watch this space.&rdquo;</p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges Data: Trading Value And Volumes Surge As Investors Flock To Markets</title>

<div> Trading, IPOs, Equity, Derivatives, Global Market<br />
Summary:
- Equity trading value and volumes increased in H1 2024
- Global equity market capitalization saw a 5% increase
- IPOs decreased globally by 24.2%
- Exchange-traded derivatives continued to grow
- Economic and geopolitical uncertainties may impact market growth.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>New data published by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and central clearing counterparties, shows that investor appetite for listed securities rose in the first half of 2024. Trading value increased 11.7%, and volumes rose 9.6%, as markets were highly liquid globally despite the backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainties. The volatility we have seen in markets in recent weeks shows this uncertainty has carried over to the second half of the year.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the six months to July 2024, global equity market capitalisation was up 5%, driven largely by the Americas, whilst the rapid growth in the APAC region reported at the end of 2023 slowed. EMEA&rsquo;s market capitalisation was flat.&nbsp;<br /><br />Compared to the previous half, IPOs fell 24.2%. The number of IPOs in the Americas rose by 36.4%, whilst both APAC and EMEA registered decreases, down -30.8% and -31.7% respectively. The number of listed companies is down marginally by 0.3% globally, though the number of listings in the Americas fell less than the same period the prior year. The EMEA region saw the sharpest decrease in number of listings, and APAC listings grew by 0.48%.&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite the overall decline in capital raised through IPOs, the average size of an IPO went up 18.8% compared to H2 2023. This was partially due to seven unicorn listings. The largest unicorn, Puig Brands, listed on SIX Group&rsquo;s BME Spanish Exchanges. SIX Group&rsquo;s Swiss Exchange also hosted the second largest unicorn, Galderma Group, a pharmaceutical company.<br /><br />Looking at other asset classes, exchange traded derivatives continued the growth trend over the last few years, rising 11.6%. There was a dramatic drop in currency options, down 38.2%, due to a regulatory change in India which requires ownership of the underlying asset before buying the derivative. The impact is marked because India was the largest market for currency options.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Key highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equity trading value&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>volumes&nbsp;</strong>increased 11.7% and 9.6% respectively compared to H2 2023, and 9.71% and 18.25% compared with H1 2023, witnessing the highest number of trades in a half-year in the last five years, including the peaks observed during the pandemic. The&nbsp;<strong>APAC&nbsp;</strong>region recorded its maximum number of trades in a half-year in the last five years (18.68 billion trades).</li>
<li>The volume of&nbsp;<strong>exchange-traded derivatives</strong>&nbsp;increased 11.6% compared to H2 2023 and 52.2% compared with H1 2023, amounting to 85.04 billion contracts.&nbsp;</li>
<li>While, compared with H2 2023,&nbsp;<strong>equity&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>interest rate derivatives</strong>&nbsp;volumes saw double digit increases (16.5% and 16.3%, respectively), their highest level in the last five years,&nbsp;<strong>currency&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>commodity&nbsp;</strong>derivatives recorded double digit declines (-38.2% and -15.4%, respectively).&nbsp;<strong>ETF derivatives</strong>&nbsp;increased only 6.8% in H1 2024.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Global equity market capitalisation</strong>&nbsp;increased 5% in H1 2024, compared to H2 2023, reaching USD 116.16 trillion, with over USD 5 trillion added to stock markets worldwide. While markets in the&nbsp;<strong>Americas&nbsp;</strong>region grew the most (+9.4%),&nbsp;<strong>APAC&nbsp;</strong>markets increased 1.4%, while&nbsp;<strong>EMEA&nbsp;</strong>markets were flat. When compared with H1 2023, there was an increase of 9.36% globally, mainly driven by the Americas region (15.82%).</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>number of IPOs</strong>&nbsp;decreased globally by 24.2% with respect to H2 2023 and by 8.7% with respect to H1 2023. While in the&nbsp;<strong>Americas&nbsp;</strong>region the number of IPOs rose by 36.4% with respect to H2 2023 and by 20% year on year, both&nbsp;<strong>APAC&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>EMEA</strong>&nbsp;registered decreases (-30.8% and -31.7% respectively, with respect to H2 2023 and -11.9% and -19.8% respectively, when compared to H1 2023). Global markets hosted 501 IPOs in H1 2024.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>capital raised through IPOs</strong>&nbsp;saw a 10% decline compared to H2 2023 and a 17% decline with respect to H1 2023, a result driven by the&nbsp;<strong>APAC</strong>&nbsp;region, which in H1 2024 recorded its minimum level in the last five years, while the&nbsp;<strong>Americas&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>EMEA&nbsp;</strong>regions experienced significant increases (97.1% and 121.4% respectively, compared to H2 2023; and 89.2% and 86% respectively, compared with H1 2023). Despite the decline, global markets hosted seven unicorns in the first half of this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;For the second half of the year a decline in inflationary pressures and an ease in monetary policy may support the positive trends we observed in H1 2024. The persistent geopolitical tensions, a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy coupled with the uncertainty derived from the U.S. election, could inhibit market growth. If that&rsquo;s the case, it will be hard on companies looking for capital, investors looking for attractive assets and savers looking to maximise their savings.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Investor demand for exchange-traded securities continued to grow, reflecting the fundamental stability of public markets in times of uncertainty. The data shows that investors are here and are looking for capital allocation opportunities. Exchanges call on governments and regulators to pull the necessary policy levers to encourage businesses to float and benefit from public finance. Without a strong pipeline of companies coming to market, the whole economy suffers.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=1898db5f19&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<div> SEC, OTC Link, SARs, AML policies, settlement<br />
Summary:<br />
OTC Link failed to file SARs for suspicious transactions, violating securities law. They agreed to a settlement of $1.19 million. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against OTC Link LLC, a New York-based broker-dealer, for failing to file numerous reports of suspicious financial transactions, known as Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), for a period of more than three years. OTC Link agreed to pay $1.19 million to settle the charges.</p>
<p>To help detect potential securities law and money-laundering violations, broker-dealers like OTC Link are required to file SARs describing suspicious transactions conducted through their firms. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, OTC Link&rsquo;s sole line of business is its operation of three alternative trading system (ATS) platforms, OTC Link ATS, OTC Link ECN, and OTC Link NQB. The three OTC Link ATSs are used by broker-dealers on a daily basis to execute or facilitate tens of thousands of transactions in over-the-counter (OTC) securities, many of which are considered microcap or penny stock securities.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, from March 2020 through May 2023, OTC Link failed to adopt or implement reasonably designed anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures to surveil transactions conducted through its ATSs for possible red flags of suspicious activity. As a result, OTC Link did not file a single SAR over this time period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broker-dealers are critical gatekeepers to the securities markets and must diligently monitor for suspicious transactions,&rdquo; said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. &ldquo;When firms like OTC Link fail to file SARs, they deprive regulators and law enforcement of important information about suspicious activity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that OTC Link violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, OTC Link agreed to a censure and a cease-and-desist order in addition to the $1.19 million penalty. The SEC&rsquo;s order also directs OTC Link to continue its engagement of a compliance consultant to review and recommend changes to the firm&rsquo;s AML policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by William Conway and Sandeep Satwalekar under the supervision of Ms. Shah of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office, with assistance from the SEC&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act Review Group and Alexander Lefferts in the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Edward Janowsky, Hermann Vargas, and Steve Vitulano of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Examinations.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders Texas Company To Pay $100,000 For Failing To Register As An Introducing Broker</title>

<div> order, charges, Introducing Broker, civil monetary penalty, cease and desist<br />
Summary: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued charges and a civil monetary penalty against Cost Management Solutions, LLC for acting as an unregistered Introducing Broker. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Cost Management Solutions, LLC (CMS), a Texas corporation. The order finds the respondent failed to register as an Introducing Broker (IB) and requires CMS to pay a $100,000 civil monetary penalty. The CFTC also orders CMS to cease and desist from further violating the CEA, as charged.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order finds from at least May 2018 through the present, CMS acted as an unregistered IB by soliciting and accepting orders for swap and options transactions for its clients. CMS mainly brokered transactions in energy commodities, including propane, heating oil, and crude oil. CMS&rsquo;s IB activities included: identifying counterparties; price discovery; negotiating trades; and trade execution. CMS did not accept any money, securities, or property to margin, guarantee, or secure these transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;CMS received fees from its clients for its brokerage services.</p>
<p>CMS&rsquo; clients were primarily propane retailers interested in hedging risk. In a typical transaction, at its client&rsquo;s behest, CMS contacted two to three potential counterparties for a quote. CMS negotiated on behalf of its client with the counterparties. If the client determined the quote was acceptable, CMS then executed the swap agreement or option transaction on behalf of the client.</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Michael Amakor, Karen Kenmotsu, A. Daniel Ullman II, and Paul G. Hayeck.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify an individual or company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that individual or entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/Exit/index.htm?http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet" target="_blank">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint">file a tip or complaint online</a>, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>Addressing Investor Needs Through Application Of The Updated Conceptual Framework In FASB Standard Setting, Paul Munter, SEC Chief Accountant</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Conceptual Framework, FASB, standard-setting, financial reporting, accounting principles<br />
Summary: FASB has updated its Conceptual Framework to guide standard-setting activities, enhance financial reporting accuracy, and protect investors' interests. <div>
<p>Recently,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) completed a comprehensive update to its Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (&ldquo;Conceptual Framework&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Now that it has finalized this significant project, it is important that the Board actively consider the objectives and fundamentals in the updated Conceptual Framework throughout all of its standard-setting activities, to guide the Board in developing improved accounting principles to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of financial reporting and the protection of investors in the public interest.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Conceptual Framework is a body of interrelated objectives and fundamental concepts that provides guidance on the nature, function, elements, measurement approaches, and disclosure objectives of financial accounting and reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The FASB issued its first financial reporting concepts statement in 1978 and subsequently issued a total of seven concept statements through 2000. In 2014, in response to stakeholder feedback, the FASB decided to more comprehensively revisit its Conceptual Framework to provide a sound foundation for developing future accounting standards. The issuance of Chapter 6,&nbsp;<i>Measurement</i>, of Concepts Statement No. 8 on July 12, 2024, represents the culmination of that project by Board members and FASB staff.</p>
<p>Now that the updates to the Conceptual Framework are complete, it is important that the Board use it to guide its agenda-setting process and standard-setting deliberations, including to assist Board members in asking the right questions and objectively evaluating whether their views are consistent with the principles laid out in the Conceptual Framework.</p>
<p>In 1938, the Commission issued ASR No. 4, warning that &ldquo;financial statements . . . prepared in accordance with accounting principles for which there is no substantial authoritative support . . . will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate despite disclosures . . . provided the matters involved are material.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;To interpret that message for today&rsquo;s environment: accounting is important, and disclosure is not a substitute for getting the accounting right on difficult or complex issues. The Conceptual Framework includes foundational concepts, including concepts on recognition and measurement of financial statement elements (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expense) and disclosures that are consistent with the words the Commission used in 1938 in ASR No. 4. Accordingly, a focus on application of the Conceptual Framework should improve the FASB&rsquo;s ability to set accounting and financial reporting standards that result in better financial information for the benefit of investors&mdash;that is, information that is relevant and that faithfully represents the economics of an issuer&rsquo;s commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>As the FASB embarks on its agenda consultation process later this year and considers its standard-setting agenda, application of the Conceptual Framework will be a critically important component of the Board&rsquo;s process. For example, the Conceptual Framework can assist the Board both in prioritizing potential projects to revise and improve accounting requirements and in determining:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether a potential project is consistent with the objectives of general purpose financial reporting;</li>
<li>How to scope a potential project, including whether a potential project should focus on disclosures-only or rather should address recognition and measurement of financial statement elements, in light of the Board&rsquo;s stated concept that &ldquo;disclosure of an amount . . . is not a substitution for recognition&rdquo;;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and</li>
<li>Whether the resulting financial reporting is expected to have the qualitative characteristics of useful financial information for users.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders may also benefit. Because the Conceptual Framework provides a common set of principles on which to base standard setting, public FASB deliberations on the application of the Conceptual Framework to each of the Board&rsquo;s standard-setting projects may help stakeholders better understand the basis of the Board&rsquo;s decisions. For example, using the Conceptual Framework as a starting point, the Board may be better able to articulate in the basis for conclusions of Accounting Standards Updates (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;)&nbsp; whether and how amendments included in an ASU are consistent with the Conceptual Framework. Additionally, to the extent the Board deviates from the principles laid out in the Conceptual Framework, a discussion of the rationale for any such deviations may help stakeholders to better understand both the standard in question and its application. Likewise, stakeholder feedback to the Board on active projects may be more informative to the Board&rsquo;s deliberations when it is grounded in the principles of the Conceptual Framework.</p>
<p>The strength of our capital markets relies upon a commitment by all stakeholders, including standard setters, to quality in every aspect of financial reporting, to be able to provide investors with timely and accurate information. With the Conceptual Framework complete, the FASB&rsquo;s focus on the guiding principles described in the Conceptual Framework can help it continue to develop high-quality accounting standards coupled with robust disclosures to best serve the needs of investors and protect the public interest.</p>

<title>SEC Charges NovaTech And Its Principals And Promoters With $650 Million Crypto Fraud - Multi-Level Marketing Company Promoted Scheme To Defraud More Than 200,000 Investors Worldwide</title>

<div> fraudulent scheme, SEC charges, NovaTech, crypto assets, MLM <br />
Summary: SEC charges NovaTech and its operators for fraudulent scheme, luring investors with false promises, resulting in substantial losses. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Cynthia and Eddy Petion, along with their company, NovaTech Ltd., for operating a fraudulent scheme that raised more than $650 million in crypto assets from more than 200,000 investors worldwide, including many in the Haitian-American community. The SEC also charged Martin Zizi, Dapilinu Dunbar, James Corbett, Corrie Sampson, John Garofano, and Marsha Hadley for their roles in promoting NovaTech to investors.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Petions operated NovaTech as a multi-level marketing (MLM) and crypto asset investment program from 2019 through 2023. They lured investors by claiming NovaTech would invest their funds on crypto asset and foreign exchange markets. Cynthia Petion assured investors that their investments would be safe and promised that &ldquo;[i]n this program, you are in profit from day one, because again you have access to that capital.&rdquo; In reality, NovaTech used the majority of investor funds to make payments to existing investors and to pay commissions to promoters, using only a fraction of investor funds for trading. The complaint further alleges that the Petions siphoned millions of dollars of investor assets for themselves. When NovaTech ultimately collapsed, most investors were not able to withdraw their investments, resulting in substantial losses, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NovaTech and the Petions caused untold losses to tens of thousands of victims around the world,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office. &ldquo;As we allege, MLM schemes of this size require promoters to fuel them, and today&rsquo;s action demonstrates that we will hold accountable not just the principal architects of these massive schemes, but also promoters who spread their fraud by unlawfully soliciting victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that NovaTech&rsquo;s top promoters, Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, Sampson, Garofano, and Hadley, each recruited a wide network of investors and promoters. NovaTech paid them substantial commissions for the investors they and their networks recruited. When Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson became aware of certain red flags about NovaTech, including regulatory actions taken against it by U.S. and Canadian regulators, they continued recruiting investors and downplayed the red flags.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges NovaTech, the Petions, Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and all of the defendants with registration violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Zizi agreed to partially settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by consenting to a $100,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions, with the amount of other monetary remedies to be determined at a later date. The partial settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Catherine Rowsey, Todd Baker, and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Sejal Bhakta of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Nikolay Vydashenko and B. David Fraser. The litigation is being conducted by Patrick Disbennett and supervised by Keefe Bernstein. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Office of the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s Investor Protection Bureau, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the British Columbia Securities Commission, and the Ontario Securities Commission.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Retail Strategy Task Force has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-alert-watch-out-fraudulent-digital-asset-and-crypto-trading-websites">Investor Alert on Fraudulent Digital Asset and &ldquo;Crypto&rdquo; Trading Websites</a>, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/resources-investors/investor-alerts-bulletins/affinity-fraud">Investor Alert: Affinity Fraud</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/crypto-scams">an Investor Alert on Crypto-Scams</a>, and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts-ia_pyramidhtm.html">Investor Alert on Pyramid Schemes Posing as Multi-Level Marketing Programs</a>.

<title>B.C.-Based Crypto Trading Platform Defrauded Customers Of $13 Million</title>

<div> Fraud, Crypto trading platform, BCSC, Cold storage, Gambling<br />
Summary:<br />
BCSC panel found that ezBtc committed fraud by diverting $13 million of customer assets to gambling, led to actual loss. Sanctions pending. <div>
<p>A B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2024/2024-BCSECCOM-348.pdf" target="_blank">has found</a>&nbsp;that a B.C.-based crypto trading platform committed fraud by lying to its customers and diverting about $13 million of their assets to gambling.</p>
<p>The platform, which operated under the name ezBtc and was incorporated by then-B.C. resident David Smillie, allowed customers to buy and sell various crypto assets.&nbsp;ezBtc and Smillie told customers that their crypto assets would be held in &ldquo;cold storage,&rdquo; a more secure method of keeping digital assets offline to protect them from cyber threats and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Instead, the BCSC panel found that approximately a third of all the crypto assets that customers deposited with ezBtc or acquired on the ezBtc platform between 2016 and 2019 were diverted to gambling sites or to Smillie&rsquo;s personal accounts on other crypto trading platforms.</p>
<p>As the panel notes, &ldquo;customers were unable to recover all of their assets. The deceit led to actual loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BCSC hired a forensic data analytics firm to determine what happened to the 2,300 bitcoins and over 600 ethers that were supposedly kept in ezBtc&rsquo;s custody in cold storage. The analytics firm determined that 935.46 bitcoins and 159 ethers were &ldquo;quickly transferred&rdquo; to either Smillie&rsquo;s personal accounts or two gambling websites. In one instance, a customer deposited a certain amount of bitcoin on ezBtc and just 14 minutes later, ezBtc transferred that exact same amount of bitcoin to one of the gambling sites.</p>
<p>The panel found that Smillie directed the affairs of ezBtc and likely directed the transfers of customer assets. Not only was Smillie aware that ezBtc did not keep custody of all of its customers&rsquo; assets, but he should have been aware that diverting customer assets could result in serious financial consequences for those customers, the panel said. By authorizing, permitting or acquiescing in ezBtc&rsquo;s misconduct, Smillie committed the same misconduct as the platform.</p>
<p>Smillie did not attend the hearing, although he was represented by a lawyer. The company, which was dissolved in 2022, did not participate in the proceedings.</p>
<p>The panel will next consider what sanctions to impose, which could include monetary sanctions and bans from market participation.</p>
<p>A list of crypto trading platforms authorized to do business with Canadians is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators, of which the BCSC is a member.</p>

<title>FESE Response To The ESMA Call For Evidence On The Review Of The UCITS Eligible Assets Directive</title>

<div> flexible approach, UCITS Eligible Assets Directive, market liquidity, banking, clearing

Summary:
FESE welcomes call for evidence to review UCITS Eligible Assets Directive for a more flexible approach, suggests adjustments for investments, and recommends amendments for clearing efficiencies. <div>
<p>FESE welcomes the call for evidence and considers that a more flexible approach in the UCITS Eligible Assets Directive could promote market liquidity and the attractiveness of EU markets. For example, the &ldquo;5/10/40 Rule&rdquo; for investments in transferable securities and money market instruments can be detrimental to issuers and investors and we suggest a review and potential adjustment of this rule to a more flexible &ldquo;20/40 Rule&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We also believe that there are inconsistencies between banking, clearing, and EU funds regulation, which disincentivise buy-side entities from using central clearing for securities financing transactions. Therefore, we recommend targeted amendments to the UCITS and MMF frameworks to facilitate more voluntary clearing and efficiencies for the buy-side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced it has begun publishing intraday values for the new Cboe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Volatility Basis Point Index ("VIXTLT Index"). Leveraging Cboe's proprietary VIX&reg; Index methodology, the VIXTLT Index provides market participants with the ability to track future (30-day) expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market in real-time.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The VIXTLT Index is designed to be a U.S. Treasury market volatility measure comparable to the Cboe Volatility Index&reg; (VIX&reg;), which measures 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. equity market and is considered by many to be the world's premier barometer of U.S. equity market volatility. By monitoring the VIXTLT and VIX indices together, investors may be offered insight into how expected volatility of two of the most important asset classes react to each other during different volatility regimes.</p>
<p>The VIXTLT Index is calculated using listed options on the iShares&reg; 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), a highly liquid exchange-traded fund (ETF) composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities exceeding twenty years that have a relatively high duration.</p>
<p>"The launch of the VIXTLT Index is another milestone in Cboe's offering of timely and transparent forward-looking volatility measures. Market participants have long sought a VIX-like gauge for U.S. Treasury volatility, and with the US election and the Federal Reserve's expected monetary policy shift looming, interest in this asset class remains high," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "With both the VIXTLT and the VIX indices utilizing similar methodologies, investors will be able to gain a more like-to-like view of expected volatility in the bond and equity markets, potentially enabling them to make more informed decisions."</p>
<p>Demand for a real-time measure of U.S. Treasury market volatility has heightened over the past few years amid periods of bond market volatility and high inflation. To meet customer demand, VIXTLT is available in basis point volatility terms and aims to provide an absolute measure of volatility, a key concept in fixed income markets where risk is commonly perceived as the absolute change and not percentage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VIXTLT Index was developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4230930-1&amp;h=1085635274&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Flabs%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Labs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Labs</a>, the company's product innovation hub, with the administrator being&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4230930-1&amp;h=1640078149&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Findices%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Global+Indices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Global Indices</a>. The index is the latest addition to Cboe's growing volatility index suite, which recently welcomed the launch of four new Credit Volatility Indices (Credit VIX), and expands Cboe's offering of more than&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4230930-1&amp;h=3620685633&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4192417-1%26h%3D4061598917%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.cboe.com%252Fus%252Findices%252Findicesproducts%252F%26a%3D450%2Bderivatives-based%2Bindices&amp;a=450+derivatives-based+indices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">450 derivatives-based indices</a>. Notably in the fixed income space, Cboe Global Indices' Cboe TLT 2% OTM BuyWrite Index is the benchmark index for the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF (TLTW).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the summer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spink.com/site/index" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spink &amp; Sons<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;held four auctions (&pound;5, &pound;10, &pound;20 and &pound;50) with our Chief Cashier and Executive Director of Banking, Sarah John, opening the bidding on the first lot for the &pound;5 auction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The auctions raised &pound;914,127 for ten charities. These include the Bank&rsquo;s three current &lsquo;charities of the year&rsquo; as well as an additional seven previous charities of the year that did not benefit from the proceeds of a charity polymer banknote auction held since 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current three&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/corporate-responsibility/charities-of-the-year">charities of the year</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.childhoodtrust.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Childhood Trust<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/spring-appeal-ppc/?https://www.trusselltrust.org/be-here-ppc/&amp;gad_source=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Trussell Trust<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://giveusashout.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shout<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;(powered by the charity Mental Health Innovations). The other charities to benefit from this auction and the ballot are:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carersuk.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6aza46WuhwMV8ZhQBh2HjgbYEAAYASAAEgIfS_D_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carers UK<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.demelza.org.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrcuW_-qghgMVtToGAB17qwuQEAAYASAAEgI7mfD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Demelza<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WWF-UK<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Brain Tumour Charity<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.londonsairambulance.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London&rsquo;s Air Ambulance Charity<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.childbereavementuk.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjsC5r6auhwMVHqiDBx1RYg-2EAAYASAAEgL84fD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Child Bereavement UK<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samaritans.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samaritans<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The auction broke the record for the highest lot sold in a Bank of England banknote auction with a &pound;50 sheet going for &pound;26,000. This was followed by the &pound;10 auction where a single note was sold for &pound;17,000 with the serial number HB01 00002.</p>
<p>Sarah John, Chief Cashier and Executive Director of Banking said: I am thrilled that the auctions and public ballot of low numbered King Charles III banknotes have raised a remarkable &pound;914,127 that will be donated to ten charities chosen by Bank of England staff. Each charity does incredible work and the monies raised will have a positive impact on people across the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each charity received over &pound;91,400 from the proceeds of the auction and ballot. This money could support initiatives such as the equivalent of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Childhood Trust could alleviate the impact of poverty for 2,600 disadvantaged children living in London, enhancing their physical and mental well-being, safety, and confidence to prepare them for life and ensure a better future.</li>
<li>Shout enabling their volunteers to take 9,140 potentially life-saving conversations with anyone in the UK in need of urgent support with their mental health.</li>
<li>The Trussell Trust supporting food banks in their network to provide emergency food parcels to over 7,600 people who can&rsquo;t afford to eat, keep warm and pay the bills.</li>
<li>Carers UK could enable Helpline Advisors to respond to over 10,447 enquiries from unpaid carers in need of support (based on an annual average of 35,000 enquiries).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Demelza could pay for two specialist nurses for a year which would provide expert clinical care for children and families wherever is best for them; in a Demelza hospice or in their homes, online, at school or in local communities.</li>
<li>WWF-UK could use this donation to protect and restore our amazing UK nature. WWF is restoring our seas by expanding seagrass meadows to help combat climate change and returning oysters to the Firth of Forth to create thriving marine habitats. On land, WWF is working with partners to restore rare chalk streams, reconnect wetlands that support native species whilst reducing flooding, and collaborating with farmers to help nature thrive.</li>
<li>The Brain Tumour Charity could fund 17 months of pioneering research on one of their Future Leaders projects to find new treatments, improve understanding, increase survival, and bring them closer to a cure. Similar funding research enabled them to announce a breakthrough in paediatric treatments in April this year and have a new medicine available on the NHS.</li>
<li>London's Air Ambulance Charity could fund 41 missions, delivering an advanced trauma team to London&rsquo;s most seriously injured patients. When there is no time to reach a hospital, their medics deliver life-saving interventions at the scene, with an average flight time of just 7.5 minutes.</li>
<li>Child Bereavement UK could fund their entire Support &amp; Information service, including their freephone Helpline, for three months, providing lifelines for families seeking support after the death of someone important to them.</li>
<li>Samaritans: help cover the cost of training 450 new volunteers to build the skills they need to answer a call to someone in emotional distress.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The King Charles banknotes mark the first time the Bank of England has changed a monarch on our banknotes. Her late Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first monarch on our banknotes, beginning with our Series C &pound;1 banknotes in 1960.</p>
<p>The King Charles banknotes are a continuation of the current series, and, as such, the serial numbers commence from the next available cypher following those previously used for the production of notes featuring Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<title>The EBA Responds To The European Commission’s Delegated Act Postponing The Application Of The Market Risk Framework In The EU</title>

<div> Delegated Act, FRTB, European Commission, EBA, market risk framework
Summary: EBA issues no-action letter on FRTB postponement, recommends no enforcement, and shares technical considerations. Concerns over two-step implementation and global regulatory fragmentation. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>Following the European Commission&rsquo;s adoption of a Delegated Act postponing the application of the revised market risk framework in the EU, the so-called Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) today publishes a no-action letter on the boundary between the banking book and the trading book and shares its considerations on technical questions and issues arising from the postponement.</span></p>
<p>In its no-action letter, the EBA recommends that competent authorities should not prioritise any supervisory or enforcement action in relation to the amendments to the provisions setting the boundary between the banking and trading books, or those defining internal risk transfers between books. In that context, the EBA also clarifies that the points it made in another&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-no-action-letter-boundary-between-banking-book">no-action letter on the same topic issued in 2023</a>&nbsp;should remain applicable.</p>
<p>The EBA is of the opinion that the front-loaded application of the revised provisions on the boundary and internal risk transfers, compared to the rest of the FRTB framework, which is not yet implemented in the Union for capital purposes, would subject institutions to an operationally complex, fragmented and costly two-step implementation. In addition, there are no jurisdictions at the global level that envisage such a two-step implementation of the FRTB framework. This means that a front-loaded application of the boundary provisions would lead to global institutions being subject to very different regulatory requirements depending on where the risk management is performed, thus resulting in a fragmentation of the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The EBA also shares some considerations on a set of technical questions and implementation issues arising from the postponement, that were deemed material and relevant with a view to achieving a harmonised implementation of the market risk framework across institutions during the postponement period. The EBA also provides clarity on the supervisory benchmarking exercise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The no-action letter is based on Article 9c of&nbsp;<a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2010/1093/2021-06-26">Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010</a>&nbsp;(EBA Founding Regulation). That article provides that the EBA may issue no-action letters, if it considers that the application of one of the relevant legislative acts is liable to raise significant issues, as provisions contained in such act may directly conflict with another relevant act, and if it considers on the basis of the information available that the application of the relevant provisions raises significant exceptional issues pertaining to market confidence and the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets.</p>
<p>On 24 July 2024, the European Commission adopted&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/banking-prudential-requirements-regulation_en">a Delegated Act</a>&nbsp;in accordance with Article 461a of Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR3&rsquo;), which postpones the use of the alternative approaches for the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk by a year to 1 January 2026. The publication of that Delegated Act by the European Commission was accompanied by a set of&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/banking-package-questions-and-answers-2024-07-24_en">question and answers on some aspects of the postponement</a>, including the application of the revised boundary between the banking and trading books, and the use of the alternative standardised approach in the context of the output floor calculations.</p>

<br />
Founder of Aquis Exchange, Alasdair Haynes, anticipates a wave of international investment in the UK due to a stable government, aiming to invigorate retail investing and UK markets. <br /><br />Summary: Aquis Exchange CEO, Alasdair Haynes, expects a surge of international investment in the UK market with a stable government and aims to promote retail investing. <div>
<p>Alasdair Haynes, founder and CEO of Aquis Exchange, anticipates a &ldquo;tidal wave of international investment&rdquo; to come to the UK following the July general election which saw the Labour Party form a new government.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/e/qn0q3518-">eToro&rsquo;s Digest &amp; Invest podcast</a> this week, Haynes discussed his optimistic outlook for the UK market for the next five to ten years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Alasdair Haynes said: </b><i>"At this point in time, I'm extremely bullish about what's going to happen in the UK and what's going to happen in Europe. The UK in particular, I think, has been a very, very cheap market and it hasn't been invested in because it hasn't had a stable government for a number of years.</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Regardless of how you voted in the last general election, now it looks like we actually have a stable government with a significant majority. I think that is going to open the doors for literally a tidal wave of international investment to be able to come into the UK. The capital will arrive not only domestically, which it has been in the past few years, but actually internationally and particularly from the United States.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>During the interview, Haynes also discussed the need to invigorate retail investing and an interest in markets in the UK. He added: &ldquo;<i>We need to get the public back into public markets&hellip; The appetite and interest in equity [in the US] is huge, and we don't have that here.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;[Aquis Exchange] is about bringing competition into our industry to change UK capital markets. It's through that that we can start to get scale-up capital to vitally important businesses to change the economy in the UK.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.etoro.com/digest-and-invest/">Digest &amp; Invest</a> podcast offers listeners financial news and market insights in a fun and digestible format. You can listen to the interview with Alasdair Haynes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKgcXc-otUU">here</a>.</p>

<div> Culture, M&amp;A, Liquidity, Supervision, Regulation
<br />
The article discusses the state of the economy, monetary policy, banking regulation, and supervision, highlighting challenges and areas for improvement.
<br /><br />Summary: The article discusses the current state of the economy, challenges in banking regulation, and the need for thoughtful and deliberate regulatory reforms. <div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you again this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Just as banking and economic conditions continue to evolve, so too do bank regulatory and supervisory standards. I look forward to learning your perspectives on the evolving banking and economic conditions, and the banking agencies' approaches to regulation and supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook</strong><br />Before discussing my thoughts on bank regulatory matters, and in light of our recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin by sharing my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>After seeing considerable progress last year, we have seen some further progress on lowering inflation in recent months. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer relative to more volatile higher-frequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated and stood at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively. The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Despite the recent good data reports, core PCE inflation averaged an annualized 3.4 percent over the first half of the year. And given that supply constraints have now largely normalized, I am not confident that inflation will decline in the same way as in the second half of last year. More importantly, prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace last year. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth moved up in the second quarter, following a soft reading in the first quarter, while private domestic final purchases (PDFP) increased at a solid pace in both quarters. During the first half of 2024, PDFP slowed much less than GDP, as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth.</p>
<p>Although consumer spending strengthened in the second quarter, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we've seen a normalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased and the number of available jobs has declined&mdash;showing signs that the labor market is coming into better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a more modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in July. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate. In addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic level. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as measured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.</p>
<p>My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality as the risks to the Committee's employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into better balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation.</p>
<p>First, as I noted earlier, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due both to increased labor force participation and strong immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and significantly higher U.S. immigration over the past few years may decrease going forward.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, as the recent surge in container shipping costs originating in Asia suggest that global supply chains remain susceptible to disruptions, which could put upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, impeding further progress on reducing inflation.</p>
<p>Finally, there continues to be a risk that the increased immigration could lead to persistently high housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize.</p>
<p>There are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, but it also appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report implies that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Moreover, the rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find a job, while layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment rate in July was centered in workers experiencing a temporary layoff, who are more likely to be rehired in coming months, and Hurricane Beryl likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last month.</p>
<p>In light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, with a focus on the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen a range of additional economic data and information, including one employment and two inflation reports. We will also have a wider view of how developments in broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook. In particular, equity prices have been volatile recently but are still higher than at the end of last year.</p>
<p>I will continue to closely monitor the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while watching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Banking Regulation and Supervision</strong><br />I will turn now to bank regulation and supervision. Today I would like to address a few topics that I expect will be of interest to those in this room, starting with the issue of culture both within banks and at bank and other financial regulatory agencies. I will then briefly discuss mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity in the banking industry, and the current and expected outlook for bank transactions. I will close with a discussion on bank liquidity regulation.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Culture at Banks and at Regulators</strong><br />In recent years, regulatory approaches have included regulators seeking to influence the culture within banks, specifically large banks, focusing on matters like building a culture that promotes compliance or effective risk management, including operational risk. A bank's culture drives its sense of ownership and a collective purpose that is common among many successful organizations, where a bank's board, management, and employees all work together in support of the bank's business purpose and mission. Bank culture can have a strong influence on both business outcomes and on compliance and risk-management outcomes.</p>
<p>Bank culture starts with bank leadership, the so-called tone from the top. Strong bank culture demands accountability for bank leadership teams and for the entire workforce. A bank's management is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the company, including which business lines to pursue, expand, or eliminate. But bank leaders also have a responsibility to empower employees to raise issues and concerns, allowing them to identify and escalate emerging business, risk-management, or compliance matters that may require management's attention or intervention. While regulators have sought to influence bank culture over time, ultimately culture is most heavily influenced and shaped by the example set by bank leaders and by the actions of each bank employee.</p>
<p>Regulatory agency culture can be similarly impactful in shaping bank regulation and supervision to promote safety and soundness and consumer compliance in an effective and efficient manner. In contrast to regulators, bank management may choose to modify or reshape their mission and objectives over time&mdash;evolving their business goals, risk-management policies and processes, and compliance standards as conditions change. For regulators, the overarching regulatory and supervisory mission and related institutional goals are prescribed by statute. While bank regulators lack the flexibility to change the mission, they have significant flexibility in the execution of that mission. This often involves broad policy goals&mdash;for example, promoting the safety and soundness of the banking system, and the stability of the financial system.</p>
<p>Similar to bank culture, regulatory agency culture begins with its leadership and is then carried out by the individual members of the organization's workforce. Culture plays a significant role in how well bank regulators pursue their statutory objectives and the manner in which they perform the related mission. Have regulators created a culture that allows the staff to identify and escalate issues of concern? Have regulators oriented the mission of the institution around core statutory goals and avoided the temptation to stray from this mission into other matters of public policy? Have regulators created a culture of accountability for leaders and employees, where shortcomings can be fairly identified and actions can be taken to remediate problems?</p>
<p>While the value of culture is widely acknowledged, both among banks and among bank regulators, we have seen some recent high-profile examples of culture falling short, and with serious consequences.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Responsible banking involves not only finding and pursuing opportunities to serve customers and grow the business, but also balancing these business priorities with a firm commitment to risk management and compliance, including consumer compliance. While banks are free to pursue growth, in some instances this growth has come without accompanying development of and investment in risk management and legal compliance, to the detriment of the bank and its customers.</p>
<p>In the case of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) failure in 2023, rapid growth was certainly a factor that contributed to the firm's fragility. The bank's management failed to properly manage its development of contingent liquidity planning, funding, and risk-management capabilities in light of its rapid growth. While this failure revealed problems with bank leadership in promoting a compliance and risk-management culture commensurate with growth, supervisors directly overseeing the bank's expansion were also late to act in the face of emerging firm risks.</p>
<p>I think we should question whether we have learned all of the right lessons from SVB's failure. We know that rapid growth is a known risk factor that should result in&nbsp;<em>additional</em>&nbsp;supervisory scrutiny. But some of the post-failure SVB reviews conducted internally by Federal Reserve staff cited rapid growth as a contributing factor for the inadequacy of the supervisory approach.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Among other things, these internal reports suggested that the shift of SVB from one supervisory portfolio to another somehow frustrated appropriate supervision. We need to ask whether supervisors are empowered to appropriately supervise firms that experience rapid growth and other emerging risks.</p>
<p>Each regulatory agency has an obligation to facilitate an environment that can help the agency best fulfill its mission. It must take care to maintain a positive and productive culture over time by listening intently to concerns that are raised, ensuring that employees are empowered to raise issues of concern (including reporting of personnel issues), and taking appropriate actions to remediate those concerns. Regulators are certainly not immune from problems arising with institutional culture.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen a high-profile example of problems with the culture at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). I commend the FDIC for engaging an independent third party to assist them in their investigation; this is an important first step toward accountability and addressing these issues.</p>
<p>We must not lose sight of the lesson that cultural problems at both banks and regulators can compound cyclical downturns in the banking environment and pose more serious risks to the banking system. Cultivating a positive culture, one that values accountability and the contributions of both management and staff to an organization's mission, can serve as a buffer against future stresses.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</strong><br />Another area of ongoing interest among regulators is the approach to banking industry M&amp;A transactions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;The significant shift in regulatory approaches is concerning. As a threshold matter, any discussion of regulatory approval standards should begin with an understanding of the critical role bank M&amp;A transactions play in a healthy banking system.</p>
<p>M&amp;A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote their long-term health and viability. M&amp;A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&amp;A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities, and leaving zombie banks that have no competitive viability or exit strategy to continue operations.</p>
<p>The impact of a more restrictive M&amp;A framework affects institutions of all sizes, including larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Banks of all sizes may choose to pursue M&amp;A to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to remain competitive with larger peers that can achieve growth organically through sheer scale. The consequence of limiting the growth options for any bank hoping to compete with the largest G-SIBs has the perverse, and unintended, consequence of actually further insulating the very largest institutions from competition.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, and while recognizing the value of M&amp;A to the banking system, regulators must be pragmatic and thoughtful about reforms. As first steps, we must define the desired end state we are seeking to achieve with any changes. We must then identify the problem that needs to be solved and proffer a solution that is fair, transparent, consistent with applicable statutes, tailored for each bank category, and efficient. We should not propose a cure without first identifying an ailment and a reasoned basis for the prescribed outcome.</p>
<p>The primary argument raised by proponents of reform is that the regulatory approval process has become a rubber stamp, one in which regulators do not conduct a meaningful review against the statutory factors laid out by Congress. Bankers who have been through the M&amp;A approval process would almost certainly disagree with the notion that regulators take a light-touch approach in reviewing banking transactions.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence to undermine this argument. Let's consider just the process of filing an application. It begins with identifying an M&amp;A target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. The next steps are preparing and filing the application, and engaging with regulators throughout the review process and beyond approval, in anticipation of post-approval business processes, including systems conversions and customer transitions.</p>
<p>The costs of M&amp;A can be substantial, and banks do not enter into transactions without significant preparation and planning, including an informed analysis that any proposal would be likely to result in regulatory approval. The demands of the process act as a self-selection mechanism, with only institutions that see both value in the transaction&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>a strong likelihood of regulatory approval going through the process. This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve data support the view that even for the self-selected population who files an application, the process does not always lead to approval. To the contrary, based on the most recent data reported for 2023, a significant portion of M&amp;A applications were withdrawn before approval, and the average processing time in the second half of 2023 was 87 days.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The number of approved M&amp;A transactions was also significantly lower in 2023 than it was in 2020, 2021, or 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>When we talk about M&amp;A process reform, it can feel like bankers and regulators are living in different worlds. Bankers seek to conclude the process in a timely way, enabling them to move forward from the uncertainty of the application process to the important work of integrating the banks' operations as quickly as possible. One of the key risks to an effective process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty. In contrast, some regulators feel pressure to revisit well-established regulatory approval standards relating to statutory factors, such as the effect of a transaction on competition, or to even expand the use of M&amp;A review to accomplish other objectives, like forcing banks to adopt regulatory standards that would not otherwise apply by regulation as a condition of approval.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Regulatory reforms should promote a healthy banking system and must acknowledge the important role M&amp;A activity plays in keeping the system healthy. Unfortunately, reform efforts, and the existing record of performance on banking M&amp;A transactions, show a concerning trend that the barriers to bank M&amp;A activity remain substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong><br />Since last spring, regulators have also focused on revisiting bank liquidity requirements. Last month, the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Atlanta hosted a research conference to discuss the Federal Reserve's traditional role as a "lender of last resort," the payments infrastructure, deposit insurance reform, and the sources of bank liquidity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The discussions included a broad range of views on all of these topics, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of all of the issues before moving forward with any proposals for solutions.</p>
<p>The failures of SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank have prompted discussion among policymakers about the need for even more regulation. It's important to emphasize here that the conditions for failure, and the subsequent banking stress, could not have occurred without bank management and supervisory failures. Therefore, identifying and remediating these known and identifiable issues to the greatest extent possible should continue to be a priority as we engage in serious discussions about regulatory reforms.</p>
<p>Those events also highlighted the need to revisit bank liquidity and funding as part of our review of the regulatory framework. When we consider the Federal Reserve's operational infrastructure, including Fedwire&reg; and discount window lending, we must ask if the Federal Reserve's tools were effective and complementary to other funding sources (including Federal Home Loan Bank funding) during times of stress, and if not, we must ask how they could be improved. Reform discussions should include not only thinking about new and revised requirements and expectations that would apply to individual banks, but also identifying opportunities to remediate deficiencies and overlapping requirements within the regulatory framework.</p>
<p><em>Lender of Last Resort and Payments Infrastructure</em></p>
<p>One area in need of attention is considering how to operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to meet banking system liquidity needs more effectively. The payments infrastructure that supports bank funding mechanisms must be prepared to operate effectively both during business-as-usual conditions and during stress events. Yet during the banking stress in 2023 and the unprecedented speed of the bank runs that occurred, some banks experienced frictions in using the discount window and limits on the availability of payment services. These issues may have interfered with liquidity management activity and exacerbated the banking stress.</p>
<p>The Fed must continue to enhance the technology, operational readiness, and services underpinning discount window loans and payment services to ensure that they are available when needed. On this front, I would note that the Federal Reserve recently published a proposal to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service, to operate 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, on a year-round basis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The proposal also requested feedback on whether the discount window should operate during these same expanded hours. Expanded service hours are a concrete example of a change that is responsive to the issues experienced last spring, but my hope is that these changes are accompanied by other important operational improvements, including improved technology and operational readiness within the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p><em>Bank Liquidity</em></p>
<p>Bank liquidity has also been a prominent feature in reform discussions, focusing on whether the calibration and scope of the regulatory framework is appropriate. This includes the discussion of possible revisions to liquidity-related regulatory requirements, including liquidity stress testing and the liquidity coverage ratio, as well as shifting supervisory expectations for contingent funding plans and the availability of alternative liquidity sources.</p>
<p>As we consider the requirements and expectations for banks, we should also consider the availability of funding and liquidity sources and mechanisms&mdash;for example, the role of repo (repurchase agreement) markets and the standing repo facility, extension of credit from the Federal Home Loan Banks, and, of course, the role of the Fed's discount window. While the Federal Reserve considers reforms specifically to the discount window, it is important to frame these discussions within a broader context of other sources, and in light of the unique position of the discount window in this framework. The discount window is a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It is intended to be a source of liquidity as a last resort and at a penalty rate, not as a primary funding resource in the normal course of business at a market rate. In evaluating the bank liquidity framework, it is imperative that we consider and understand the interrelationships among these resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and bank liquidity planning.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Some policymakers have stated that a potential response to the 2023 banking stress would be to require banks to preposition collateral at the Fed's discount window, and while policymakers have discussed potential&nbsp;<em>regulatory&nbsp;</em>reforms to implement this change,&nbsp;<em>supervisory&nbsp;</em>communications have already begun directing collateral prepositioning as a supervisory best practice. As a policy reform, the notion is that forcing banks to preposition collateral in this way will create a ready pool of liquidity those banks can draw from during times of stress. This compulsory requirement to preposition collateral, it is argued, could also mitigate some of the stigma associated with using the discount window and thereby improve its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a prepositioning requirement as a solution to perceived stigma concerns remains to be seen, but one can reasonably question if compulsory prepositioning or compulsory use of the discount window would materially change market perceptions and resolve bank concerns about stigma. There is no reason for a bank to take a loan at a penalty rate or to preposition collateral during periods of calm if the discount window operates effectively and communicates with banks on a regular basis. If the issue is that the window does not operate in an effective manner, requirements to use it more frequently will not address these underlying operational issues. To the contrary, investments must be made to address its operational shortcomings.</p>
<p>Some reforms, like encouraging bank readiness to borrow from the discount window if that is part of banks' contingency funding plans, could be explored more thoroughly. If a bank includes the discount window in these plans and intends to use it during stress, the bank should be prepared to do so. But if we are honest, we must recognize that our prior efforts to reduce discount window stigma, as during the COVID period, have not been durable or successful, and that perhaps resources would be better devoted to making sure the discount window is prepared to act in a timely way, rather than adding even more regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations to banks that may complicate day-to-day liquidity management, with uncertain liquidity benefits during stress.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next steps in liquidity reform, it is imperative that we tackle known and identified issues that were exposed during the banking stress last year. This must include updating discount window operations and technology and making sure that payment services are available when needed. But for other reforms, a number of important questions remain unanswered, including understanding both where there are frictions and weaknesses in the current bank funding landscape, and what the potential impact (including intended and unintended consequences) of these reforms on the banking industry could be. In my view, remediation of known issues must remain a key priority.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />The federal banking agencies' reform agenda has recently been directed toward rapid and transformational change, rather than deliberate and incremental change. Just as a bank's rapid growth may increase the risks of outgrowing risk-management and compliance frameworks, rapid regulatory reforms increase the risk of regulation resulting in harmful unintended consequences to the banking and financial system. Banks are already experiencing the effects of this "rapid change" approach through the supervisory process. And it will become increasingly clear as the reform agenda continues on its current path.</p>
<p>Bankers should be concerned about significant swings of the regulatory pendulum, swings that increase financial system uncertainty and instability and that complicate day-to-day operations and long-term planning. Deliberate, thoughtful change allows the Federal Reserve to demonstrate that it executes its duties in an independent manner, focusing on its statutory obligations, and helps build public support and trust.</p>
<p>I look forward to our conversation.</p>

<div> Fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission, Ideanomics, CEO, Financial Performance
Summary:<br /><br />The Securities and Exchange Commission settled fraud charges against Ideanomics and its executives for misleading the public about the company's financial performance.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled fraud charges against Ideanomics, Inc., formerly known as Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc., and its former Chairman and CEO, Zheng (Bruno) Wu, for misleading the public about the company&rsquo;s financial performance between 2017 and 2019. The SEC also announced settled charges against Ideanomics&rsquo; current CEO, Alfred Poor, and former CFO, Federico Tovar, for their roles in the scheme.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s orders allege that, in mid-November 2017, Ideanomics and Wu reported 2017 revenue guidance of $300 million, despite numerous known issues indicating that the company would miss this guidance by a wide margin. The company later reported only $144 million in 2017 revenues. Ideanomics and Wu also misled the company&rsquo;s auditor with a fraudulent letter of intent from a purportedly interested buyer of certain assets to avoid writing down those assets by $17 million in 2017, and Wu improperly hid his personal interest in two companies that received millions in cash and stock from deals with Ideanomics between 2017 and 2019, according to the orders. The SEC further alleged that Ideanomics, Wu, Poor, and Tovar improperly accounted for a deal involving crypto assets in 2019, resulting in the company&rsquo;s overstatement of revenues by more than $40 million, and made false representations in company financial statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we alleged, Ideanomics and its executives defrauded investors, including by misstating its financial statements and failing to disclose material information to investors,&rdquo; said Stacy Bogert, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;The investing public must be able to trust the accuracy of a company&rsquo;s disclosures, and we will hold accountable executives who abuse that trust by engaging in fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order against Wu finds that he violated the antifraud, reporting, internal control, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and caused certain of the company&rsquo;s violations. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Ideanomics, Poor, and Tovar finds that Ideanomics violated the antifraud, reporting, internal control, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws, and it finds that Poor and Tovar violated the antifraud, reporting, and books and records provisions and caused certain of the company&rsquo;s violations.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, all respondents settled the matter by agreeing to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions. Wu agreed to pay more than $3.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $200,000 penalty. Tovar and Poor each agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty. Ideanomics agreed to pay a $1.4 million penalty and to retain an independent compliance consultant to review, assess, and make recommendations as to the company&rsquo;s internal accounting controls. Finally, Wu agreed to a ten-year officer and director bar, and Tovar agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant for at least two years.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jason Litow and Brian Palechek and supervised by Pei Chung, Peter Rosario, and Ms. Bogert, with assistance by James Connor, James Carlson, Duane Thompson, Kristen Warden, and David Mendel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.</p>

<div> Draft ITS, credit risk, market risk, IFRS9 models, benchmarking exercise
<br />
Draft ITS amends credit risk, market risk, and IFRS9 models for 2025 exercise. Significant changes in market risk framework, minor changes in credit risk. Data collection deadlines postponed.
<br /><br />Summary:
The EBA published final draft ITS, amending credit risk, market risk, and IFRS9 models for the 2025 exercise. Significant changes in market risk framework, minor changes in credit risk. Data collection deadlines have been postponed. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), amending the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R2070-20240328"><span>Implementing Regulation on the benchmarking</span></a><span>&nbsp;of credit risk, market risk and IFRS9 models for the 2025 exercise. The most significant change is in the area of market risk framework, where&nbsp;</span><a id="_Hlk173158520" name="_Hlk173158520"><span>the EBA is proposing to expand to all asset classes the alternative standardised approach (ASA) validation portfolios compared to the 2024 exercise</span></a><span>. In the area of credit risk, the EBA suggests only minor changes.</span></p>
<p>In the area of market risk, the templates based on the alternative internal model approach (AIMA) have not been implemented because of the adoption of a Delegated Act by the European Commission that&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/capital-requirements-regulation_en">postpones the implementation</a>&nbsp;of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) in the EU. Therefore, both the content and the sample of banks for the data collection in the area of market risk remain the same as in the 2024 exercise. Compared to the 2024 exercise, the data collection deadlines have been postponed to allow participating banks some more time as a result of the delay in the publication of this amending ITS.</p>
<p>In the area of credit risk, the few amendments clarify, on the one hand, the mandatory nature - if available - of reporting the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) risk parameters in relation to the margin of conservatism (MoC), regulatory add-ons, and downturn components, and, on the other hand, the use of internal model IDs used by the competent authorities.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>This draft ITS have been developed in accordance with article 78 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which requires the EBA to specify the benchmarking portfolios, templates, and definitions to be used as part of the annual benchmarking exercises. These are used by competent authorities to conduct an annual assessment of the quality of internal approaches used for the calculation of own funds requirements.</p>
<p>The EBA annual benchmarking exercise forms the basis for both the supervisory assessment and the horizontal analysis of the outcome of internal models. It ensures consistent monitoring of the variability of own funds requirements resulting from the application of internal models as well as on the impact of the several different supervisory and regulatory measures which influence the capital requirements and solvency ratios in the EU.</p>

<div> Bitcoin, volatility, price, rebound, cryptocurrency <br />
Summary:<br />
Bitcoin's price dropped from $70,000 to $50,000 but rebounded to $60,000 in a week. Market sentiment remains bullish. Mercuryo saw a significant increase in transaction volume. <br /> <div>
<p>Bitcoin has faced significant volatility in recent days. Earlier this week, its price plummeted from $70,000 to approximately $50,000. However, in less than a week, Bitcoin has rebounded to $60,000.</p>
<p>Commenting on these price fluctuations, Arthur Firstov, Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo&mdash;a leading provider of payment infrastructure in the digital token sector&mdash;shared his insights:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is resurgent after a dramatic switch from fear to greed. As the digital token market is pulled higher crypto enthusiasts are once again focusing on the king of crypto breaching the $100,000 mark. While fears over the US economy and events such as Mt. Gox and the selling of Bitcoin by the German government has spooked investors in a week that began with a &lsquo;crypto Black Monday,&rsquo; the overriding sentiment appears to be that the bull market is intact. Regardless, a belief in the underlying technology among an army of retail investors remains unwavering. When the cryptocurrency market crashed on Monday this week, Mercuryo experienced an 82 per cent week-on-week increase in transaction volume amid a stampede of those buying the dip.&rdquo;</p>

<div> regulatory measures, market supervision, investor confidence, Auction Matching Method, Dynamic Price Band
Summary:<br />The Stock Exchange of Thailand implements Auction Matching Method, Dynamic Price Band, and Minimum Resting Time to enhance market supervision and boost investor confidence. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has announced three additional regulatory measures to enhance market supervision and boost investor confidence, following recent amendments to short selling and program trading regulations. The new measures, effective September 2, 2024, are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Auction Matching Method will be required for all investors trading securities that SET has designated as the trading surveillance measures at Level 2 and above, in addition to the existing measures for securities with abnormal trading conditions. </li>
<li>Dynamic Price Band for individual securities of &plusmn;10 percent from the latest execution price will be imposed. This measure will complement the existing daily ceiling and floor price limits of &plusmn;30 percent from the previous day&rsquo;s closing price, providing an additional mechanism to mitigate securities price fluctuation. </li>
<li>Minimum Resting Time before an order can be amended or cancelled is set at 250 milliseconds. This measure aims to curb excessively frequent order updates and cancellations that could potentially mislead the market about high demand for particular securities. </li>
</ol>
<p>For more detailed information, please visit SET's website: <a href="http://www.set.or.th/">www.set.or.th</a> under the menu &ldquo;Rules &amp; Regulations&rdquo; section, then &ldquo;Rules &amp; Circular Letters&rdquo;.</p>

<div> Second cohort, investED Leadership Programme, Malaysian graduates, capital market, industry partners
<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia's investED Leadership Programme aims to enhance employability by offering training and job placements in the capital market industry.
<br /><br />Summary: The investED Leadership Programme provides training and job placements in the capital market industry for Malaysian graduates, in collaboration with industry partners. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has commenced the second cohort of the investED Leadership Programme, an SC-led initiative to help ensure a sustainable talent pipeline for the capital market.</p>
<p>Launched by Prime Minister Dato&rsquo; Seri Anwar Ibrahim in June 2023, the flagship graduate programme is also designed to help enhance the employability of local graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initiative is the first ever such tie-up between the SC, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Higher Education, the capital market industry and universities. investED is opened to all Malaysian graduates from all disciplines.</p>
<p>For the second cohort, the investED Leadership Programme offered placements to 268 trainees. On 1 August 2024, 197 trainees began a one-month comprehensive classroom training at the Asia School of Business in Kuala Lumpur. This will be followed by a sixmonth on-the-job experience with leading industry partners, beginning 1 September 2024.</p>
<p>The first cohort of 169 candidates graduated in February this year after completing a sixmonth job placement with 53 capital market partner companies. More than 65% of them were offered jobs with investED's partners.</p>
<p>This year, the investED programme has roped in a wider array of partner companies. They include investment banks, stockbroking firms, fund management companies, equity crowdfunding platforms, and advisory services.</p>
<p>So far, 50 partner firms have agreed to place the second cohort&rsquo;s trainees. Host companies with the highest placement offered include the SC, Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, Moomoo Securities Sdn Bhd, Hong Leong Group, Affin Hwang Investment Bank and Maybank.</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said the collaboration with the various companies will provide valuable exposure to different aspects of the industry, offering trainees a well-rounded experience.</p>
<p>Since its inception, investED has also engaged 77,185 university students via eight career fairs and 36 career talks nationwide. It plans to engage more students, universities and partner firms this year.</p>
<p>The programme is aimed at improving the capital market knowledge of 9,000 university students and provide up to 600 jobs in the capital market industry between 2023 and 2025.</p>

<p>The Financial advice update is a round-up of regulatory developments and issues affecting financial advice.</p>
<p>It covers all areas of financial advice regulation and includes a broad range of content relevant to Australian financial services (AFS) licensees who are advice licensees and financial advisers.</p>

<li><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/financial-advice-update/#subscribe">keeping up to date with financial advice news</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="maintaining"></a>Maintaining accurate records on the financial advisers register</h2>
<p>AFS licensees are reminded to check that the information about their financial advisers on the financial advisers register is correct. AFS licensees should pay particular attention to their adviser&rsquo;s approved qualification(s), ability to provide tax (financial) advice services, business address and telephone number.</p>
<p>Any incorrect or out-of-date information must be rectified by lodging a &lsquo;maintain&rsquo; transaction on ASIC Connect.</p>
<p>ASIC recently identified errors and inconsistencies on the financial advisers register, including in relation to records of approved degrees and qualifications: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-142mr-asic-urges-afs-licensees-to-correct-records-on-the-financial-advisers-register/">24-142MR</a>&nbsp;<em>ASIC urges AFS licensees to correct records on the financial advisers register</em>&nbsp;(1 July 2024).</p>
<p>Common errors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>failure to record the degrees accurately in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01848/latest/text"><em>Corporations (Relevant Providers Degrees, Qualifications and Courses Standard) Determination 2021</em></a>&nbsp;(Determination)</li>
<li>recording degrees that are not approved degrees, but are professional designations (e.g. &lsquo;Certified Financial Planner&rsquo;)</li>
<li>recording degrees that are not approved degrees, but are bridging courses (which may be listed in the Determination but must be coupled with another qualification to meet the requirements of the professional standard), and</li>
<li>recording qualifications that are not approved qualifications under the Determination (e.g. the Financial Adviser Exam, Australian Qualifications Framework 1&ndash;5 qualifications, and training or qualifications listed in Regulatory Guide 146&nbsp;<em>Licensing: Training of financial product advisers</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-146-licensing-training-of-financial-product-advisers/" title="RG 146 Licensing: Training of financial product advisers">RG 146</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a serious offence to knowingly provide false or misleading information to ASIC or to fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information provided to ASIC is true and correct. It is also an offence to fail to update the financial advisers register within 30 business days of a financial adviser&rsquo;s details changing.</p>
<p>ASIC will shortly be commencing a compliance program to ensure that the information recorded on the financial advisers register about approved qualifications is correct and take action where necessary.</p>
<h2><a id="assessing"></a>Assessing adviser qualifications</h2>
<p>If you are an advice licensee, among other things, you must ensure your relevant providers (i.e. advisers who are authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products) comply with the &lsquo;qualifications standard&rsquo; in section 921B(2) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Corporations Act) before authorising them, even if they have been previously authorised by another advice licensee.</p>
<p>Financial advisers who are existing providers have until 1 January 2026 to meet the qualifications standard. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/quick-reference-guide-applying-the-financial-adviser-professional-standards/" title="Quick reference guide: Applying the financial adviser professional standards">quick reference guide</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website.</p>
<p>Generally, an existing provider who meets the criteria for an experienced provider can rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard and the professional year standard without needing to undertake further education and training. For more information on the experienced provider pathway, see Information Sheet 281&nbsp;<em>FAQs: Relevant providers &ndash; Accessing the experienced provider pathway</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/faqs-relevant-providers-accessing-the-experienced-provider-pathway/">INFO 281</a>).</p>
<p>Under section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act, a person who is, or is to be, a relevant provider&nbsp;<span>must have completed a bachelor or higher degree, or equivalent qualification, approved by the Minister</span>. This applies to both existing providers and new financial advisers, as well as advisers with foreign qualifications. For a list of approved degrees and equivalent qualifications see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01848/latest/text">Determination</a>.</p>
<h3>Assessing your advisers&rsquo; qualifications against the Determination</h3>
<p>To assess whether your adviser(s) has completed an approved bachelor or higher degree, or equivalent qualification, under the Determination, see the guidance for AFS licensees to check qualifications on the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Qualification, exam and professional development</a>&nbsp;page of the ASIC website.</p>
<p>As an AFS licensee, you must ensure that the qualifications exactly match those listed in the Determination. If a domestic qualification has been completed in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Determination, but does not satisfy the prescribed conditions (e.g. unit codes or names do not match or different commencement dates), then an application can be made to Treasury to assess whether the qualification satisfies section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act: see&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.treasury.gov.au/education-standards/domestic-qualifications">Domestic qualifications: Criteria for assessment</a>&nbsp;on the Treasury website.</p>
<p>If an adviser has foreign qualifications, an application can also be made to Treasury to assess whether these qualifications are equivalent to an Australian bachelor&rsquo;s or higher degree: see&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.treasury.gov.au/education-standards/foreign-qualifications">Foreign qualifications: Criteria for assessment</a>&nbsp;on the Treasury website.</p>
<p>If Treasury establishes that an adviser has completed an approved degree or qualification, the relevant provider&rsquo;s authorising AFS licensee must record this on the financial advisers register as an approved degree or qualification. This can be completed during the appointment process or by submitting a maintenance transaction if the adviser has already been appointed by the AFS licensee.</p>
<h2><a id="cold-calling"></a>ASIC&rsquo;s review of cold calling for superannuation switching business models</h2>
<p>In our 2023&ndash;27 Corporate Plan, ASIC announced a cross-sector project focused on deterring cold calling for superannuation switching business models. Our review identified that some cold calling businesses are using high-pressure sales tactics to induce consumers into taking unnecessary and inappropriate superannuation switching advice, leading to poor outcomes for clients. These adverse outcomes range from superannuation erosion due to high fees and charges, to the risk of a reduced superannuation balance due to inappropriate investment in high-risk and/or low-quality superannuation products.</p>
<p>Some of the cold calling operators &ndash; which make unsolicited calls to consumers after obtaining their personal information from third-party data brokers or by using online click-bait &ndash; have lead-generation and referral arrangements with a small subset of financial advisers who typically recommend consumers switch to super products that charge significant fees.</p>
<p>ASIC has observed considerable volumes of superannuation fund movement as a result of cold calling conduct, including inflow into platforms, high-risk property investments and significant payments to cold calling operators.</p>
<p>ASIC also observed some cold calling businesses bypassing data brokers by posting click-bait advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These advertisements often promote superannuation comparison calculators that give consumers the impression their existing superannuation fund is underperforming.</p>
<p>ASIC identified several areas of concern and is reminding advice licensees and financial advisers of their respective obligations to act in the best interests of consumers when providing financial services.</p>
<p>Advice licensees should ensure they have in place adequate monitoring and supervision arrangements to detect concerning conduct and to make sure their advisers are acting in the best interests of their clients.</p>
<p>Deterring cold calling for superannuation switching models is an ASIC priority. We will continue to take action, where appropriate &ndash; including enforcement action &ndash; against individuals or entities who are engaging in misconduct.</p>
<p>You can find more information on ASIC&rsquo;s review of cold calling for superannuation switching business models in our news item&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/exposing-high-pressure-cold-calling-tactics-and-social-media-click-bait-leading-to-superannuation-switching/" title="Exposing high-pressure cold calling tactics and social media click-bait leading to superannuation switching">Exposing high-pressure cold calling tactics and social media click-bait leading to superannuation switching</a>&nbsp;(7 May 2024).</p>
<p>We have issued Information Sheet 282&nbsp;<em>Unsolicited contact leading to financial advice</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/unsolicited-contact-leading-to-financial-advice/">INFO 282</a>) for unlicensed entities that engage with consumers, leading to financial advice. It sets out how the financial services laws apply to these entities and reminds them of their responsibility to ensure that their conduct complies with the law.</p>
<p>ASIC has also launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/media-centre/news-asic-warns-consumers-to-just-hang-up-on-superannuation-cold-callers">consumer awareness campaign</a>, encouraging consumers to &lsquo;<span>just hang up</span>&rsquo; when contacted by cold calling operators and to&nbsp;<span>&lsquo;just scroll past&rsquo;</span>&nbsp;social media click-bait advertisements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="cyber"></a>Cyber security &ndash; Third-party exposure</h2>
<p>The practice of outsourcing services and products is crucial to most organisations operating in today&rsquo;s economy, with 76% of leading global businesses outsourcing IT functions. While financial services businesses can outsource their services to third-party suppliers, they cannot outsource the associated risks and liabilities.</p>
<p>Recently, ASIC released findings from our 2023 Cyber Pulse Survey: see Report 776&nbsp;<em>Spotlight on cyber: Findings and insights from the cyber pulse survey</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-776-spotlight-on-cyber-findings-and-insights-from-the-cyber-pulse-survey-2023/" title="REP 776 Spotlight on cyber: Findings and insights from the cyber pulse survey 2023">REP 776</a>). Worryingly, 44% of participating organisations admitted to not managing third-party or supply chain risk.</p>
<p>ASIC has observed a growing number of cyber attacks on Australian organisations stemming from third-party attacks that exploit weaknesses in an organisations supply chain, giving them easy access to the organisation&rsquo;s systems and networks.</p>
<p>AFS licensees from across Australia have told ASIC they consider cyber security the biggest risk to their business, listing it as a high priority item for board meetings and noting they run regular staff training at all levels of their business. AFS licensees have moved to reinforce their internal cyber security after a series of high-profile incidents from late 2022. With many organisations acting to improve internal defences, their focus must now turn to mitigating third-party exposure &ndash; the new frontline in cyber risk management.</p>
<p>For example, the SolarWinds breach of 2020 exploited a vulnerability in SolarWinds&rsquo; platform, giving the threat actor access to 3,000 email accounts across 150 organisations, including government agencies and multinational corporations. The breach cost each affected organisation an average of US$12 million.</p>
<p>To enhance the cyber resilience of Australia&rsquo;s financial institutions against known threat actors, the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) developed the cyber and operational intelligence-led exercises (CORIE) framework: see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cfr.gov.au/publications/policy-statements-and-other-reports.html#2022">Revised CORIE framework and rollout</a>&nbsp;on the CFR website. CORIE uses threat intelligence to simulate adversary attacks and assess the cyber resilience of an organisation. Recent CORIE simulations have exposed vulnerabilities in third-party controls, including instances where third parties held administrator-level access to critical systems.</p>
<p>The recent Latitude Financial cyber attack underscores the need for enhanced scrutiny of third parties with access to core systems. While IT outsourcing is essential for many organisations, basic controls &ndash; like multifactor authentication (MFA) for external providers &ndash; could minimise breach risks.</p>
<p>Another concerning trend demonstrated by CORIE simulations is the use of weak passwords. Even with complex password creation requirements, users can find ways to craft weak passwords like &lsquo;Pa$$w0rd123!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>MFA is one of the most effective techniques available to protect organisations from a cyber incident. Where MFA is not available, the Australian Signals Directorate&rsquo;s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) recommends the use of passphrases: see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/securing-your-accounts/passphrases">Passphrases</a>&nbsp;on the ACSC website. These measures should be implemented as part of a broader cultural shift throughout an organisation, driven by employee education, cyber awareness training and rigorous third-party risk assessment.</p>
<p>To mitigate cyber risk, organisations must take an active approach to identifying, assessing, and monitoring third-party cyber risks. We encourage organisations to start by asking three simple questions:</p>

<div class="expandCollapseButtons"><button class="accordionExpand">Expand all</button><button class="accordionCollapse">Collapse all</button></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="registration"></a>Financial adviser registration</h2>
<p>On 16 February 2024, the registration requirement commenced whereby all relevant providers, except provisional relevant providers, must be registered before providing personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products.</p>
<p>The registration requirement is an&nbsp;<span>ongoing obligation</span>&nbsp;and is separate to the requirement for AFS licensees to appoint their relevant providers to the financial advisers register. Self-licensed relevant providers must also be registered. AFS licensees and relevant providers should ensure they understand the circumstances when new registration is required and the circumstances that may lead to a relevant provider being deregistered.</p>
<p>AFS licensees must register their relevant providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>after they authorise and appoint an adviser to the financial advisers register</li>
<li>when they appoint an adviser who has moved from another AFS licensee</li>
<li>when an adviser changes roles from a &lsquo;provisional relevant provider&rsquo; to a &lsquo;relevant provider&rsquo;, and</li>
<li>when an adviser is authorised by two or more AFS licensees and registered by one, and the adviser&rsquo;s authorisation with their registering AFS licensee ceases.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 16 February 2024, both the AFS licensee and the relevant provider will be in breach of the law if an unregistered relevant provider provides personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products.</p>
<p>ASIC recently commenced a compliance program in relation to the registration requirement and has already identified that a number of advisers have not been registered following their move from one AFS licensee to another. In order to avoid regulatory action, please ensure all your advisers are currently registered, particularly those who have changed AFS licensee since 16 February 2024.</p>

<h2><a id="rep-779"></a>Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em></h2>
<p>Around $1.1 trillion of Australians&rsquo; total retirement savings are invested in the choice product segment. The decision of where to invest these savings is one of the most important decisions a member will make &ndash; and is often made based on recommendations by a financial adviser.</p>
<p>A 2018 Productivity Commission inquiry and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&rsquo;s (APRA) annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/choice-heatmap">Choice Heatmap</a>&nbsp;highlighted persistent underperformance of some investment options within the choice sector. In 2023, APRA found one in five choice investment options with an 8-year history significantly underperformed the investment return benchmarks.</p>
<p>To understand why some choice super fund members remained in these poorly performing investment options, we looked at what superannuation trustees, financial advisers and advice licensees did in relation to performance. Each of these stakeholders is responsible for assisting Australians to achieve good retirement outcomes.</p>
<p>Financial advisers have an important role, and their clients (i.e. fund members) trust them to act in their best interests when providing advice about how to achieve their retirement objectives.</p>
<p>On 21 February 2024, we published our observations in Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>).</p>

<p>In March 2017, the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Amendment (Professional Standards of Financial Advisers) Act 2017&nbsp;</em>commenced and introduced reforms to the Corporations Act to raise the education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers. The professional standards require financial advisers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an approved qualification</li>
<li>pass the financial adviser exam</li>
<li>participate in 40 hours of continuing professional development each year, and</li>
<li>comply with the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00117">Code of Ethics</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to become a financial adviser must also complete a full-time professional year that includes at least 1,500 hours of work and activities and 100 hours of structured training (a total of 1,600 hours).</p>
<p>For more information about the professional standards, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Qualification, exam and professional development</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website, and</li>
<li>the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00117">Code of Ethics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ASIC&rsquo;s supervision activities, we conducted a review with a cross section of AFS licensees, which included understanding their experience with employing a provisional relevant provider. We asked them details about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the process for taking on the responsibility of training and supervising a provisional relevant provider</li>
<li>the processes they used to verify and record training hours</li>
<li>how they selected and monitored the supervisor of the provisional relevant provider, and</li>
<li>the process for certifying the provisional relevant provider has meet all of the requirements for completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All licensees involved reported a positive experience of supporting a provisional relevant provider through their professional year. Some listed the benefits as supporting and assisting with their succession planning, and appreciated that they could mentor and train a provisional relevant provider from within the business rather than hiring an external adviser.</p>
<p>We also observed licensee practices that could be improved, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>putting policies in place about who is qualified and suitable to be a supervisor</li>
<li>developing processes for how licensees will monitor professional relevant providers and the supervisor, including their advice, once the provisional relevant provider is in the third and fourth quarters of their professional year, and</li>
<li>having detailed processes in place for final sign off of the completion certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFS licensees are reminded of the importance of record keeping throughout the professional year. Most licensees indicated they were able to comply with the record-keeping obligations by using, and in some cases amending, the templates created by the former standards body, the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority. Others created their own methods for maintaining logbooks to record the structured and unstructured training hours, and to demonstrate and record that all key competencies were satisfactorily acquired.</p>

<title>Concurring Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Joint Data Standards Proposal</title>

<div> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Financial Data Transparency Act, Joint Data Standards Proposal, regulated entities, costs <br />
<br />
Summary: The author supports the Financial Data Transparency Act but urges consideration of the costs imposed on regulated entities.<br /> <div>
<p><span>I respectfully concur from the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Financial Data Transparency Act (FDTA) Joint Data Standards (&ldquo;Joint Data Standards Proposal&rdquo;) to require each respective agency to implement certain data standards for its regulated entities because there is insufficient discussion of the impact and costs associated with the adoption of these new data standards that will apply across the banking and financial services sector (including small entities as set forth under the Regulatory Flexibility Act). &nbsp;While I support the FDTA&rsquo;s mandate, I believe the Joint Data Standards Proposal would be improved by addressing head-on the elephant in the room&mdash;the very real costs that will be imposed on potentially tens of thousands of firms of all sizes that will eventually have to update their systems and records to adhere to the new data standards. I encourage all commenters to address the costs and benefits of the Joint Data Standards Proposal, including the necessary future agency rulemakings that will subsequently follow. I thank Ted Kaouk, Tom Guerin, Jeffrey Burns, and the staff of the CFTC, and all the other agencies for their efforts on this proposal.</span></p>

<title>CFTC Approves A Joint Rule Proposal To Establish Technical Data Reporting Standards</title>

<div> standards, data reporting, financial regulatory agencies, Financial Data Transparency Act, public comment
Summary:<br /> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed uniform data standards for reporting to multiple financial regulatory agencies, promoting interoperability and common identifiers.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today voted to jointly propose and request public comment on the establishment of technical data reporting standards with other financial regulatory agencies. The proposal would establish uniform data standards for the collections of information reported to the CFTC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Department of the Treasury. The proposal would also establish uniform data standards for data collected from these financial regulatory agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Comments on the proposal are due 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposed standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the financial regulatory agencies through the adoption of common identifiers for legal entities, financial instruments, and other data. In addition to proposing the use of common identifiers, the proposal would also further standardize the format and transmission of data to financial regulatory agencies.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposed rule is part of the implementation of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (FDTA). Although the CFTC is not specifically referenced in the FDTA, the Secretary of the Treasury designated the CFTC as a covered agency on May 3, 2024. While the designation does not require the CFTC to issue individual rules adopting the proposed technical data reporting standards, this request for comment will give interested parties an opportunity to provide input at this early stage.</span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Awards Over $1 Million To Whistleblower Who Aided A Digital Assets-Related Investigation</title>

<div> whistleblower, CFTC, digital assets, enforcement action, whistleblower program
Summary: The CFTC awarded a whistleblower over $1 million for information about digital asset misconduct, highlighting the program's success in tackling violations and protecting whistleblowers. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced a whistleblower award of over $1 million to a whistleblower who provided significant information and assistance that led the CFTC to bring an enforcement action connected to digital asset markets.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Identifying unlawful conduct in the digital asset marketplace is a major priority for the CFTC, especially as everyday Americans are increasingly victimized by digital asset scams,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;During the last fiscal year, digital asset cases accounted for almost 50% of the CFTC&rsquo;s docket, and the majority of whistleblower tips that year were related to digital assets.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Whistleblowers have increasingly played a significant role in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement actions in the digital assets space,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, the whistleblower provided sufficiently specific and credible information that assisted the CFTC in bringing a successful action.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>CFTC based its enforcement action on&nbsp;<span>whistleblower</span>-<span>provided information about improper trading&nbsp;</span>that was unknown to&nbsp;<span>the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $380 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling nearly $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Getting To Grips With Treasury Clearing</title>

<div> SEC, US Treasury, reforms, documentation, market liquidity
Summary:
SEC US Treasury reforms require extensive documentation, recalibration of capital rules, and resolution of legal and operational issues. Collaboration is vital for successful implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>When it comes to the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) US Treasury reforms, one thing is very clear: there&rsquo;s an awful lot to do and not a lot of time to do it. From the development of documentation to the recalibration of certain capital rules, there&rsquo;s an enormous laundry list of tasks that needs to be worked through &ndash; something that will require time and a collective effort from the entire industry.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247">SEC finalized its regulations last December</a>, which include a requirement to clear certain Treasury cash transactions from December 31 next year and Treasury repos from June 30, 2026. Among other things, market participants will need to assess existing and future clearing models to determine which best suits their needs. Legal documentation will need to be developed, negotiated and executed, and regulatory-compliant structures for the segregation of client margin will need to be put in place and tested. All of this work comes against a backdrop of concern about the need to maintain and enhance market liquidity, particularly during periods of stress.</p>
<p>For our part, ISDA will continue to engage closely with members and regulators and assist with implementation where we can. SIFMA is leading the work to develop the documentation, and we&rsquo;re participating in that working group. ISDA is also providing input on the optimal clearing models. We&rsquo;ve published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/02/23/isda-clearing-model-comparison/">comparison of various clearing models</a>&nbsp;for US Treasury transactions and derivatives that will be updated as new models emerge, and we recently submitted responses to the SEC on proposed rule changes by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) &ndash; one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/17/isda-submits-comments-to-ficc-on-proposed-rule-changes/">clearing models and margin segregation</a>&nbsp;and one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/08/06/isda-letter-on-ficcs-proposed-rulebook-changes/">trade submission requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Solving these legal and operational issues will be critical, but it&rsquo;s also important that the US prudential framework is calibrated so it is risk appropriate and supports market liquidity.</p>
<p>One example is the lack of recognition in the revised US capital framework for cross-margining programs, such as the one offered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/january/23/cme-group-and-dtcc-launch-treasury-cross-margining-arrangement-for-clearing-members">FICC and CME Group</a>&nbsp;for transactions based on US Treasury securities and interest rate futures &ndash; an issue ISDA is exploring in partnership with FIA. These services allow firms to obtain initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of transactions, but there are no commensurate benefits from a capital perspective under the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. As more Treasury securities and repos are cleared as a result of the SEC&rsquo;s rule, a lack of recognition for cross-margining will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing.</p>
<p>ISDA has also worked with SIFMA to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">propose several calibration changes</a>&nbsp;to the Basel III endgame proposals and the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIB) to ensure the rules do not disproportionately hamper the ability of banks to act as intermediaries. These include changes to certain aspects of the rules for credit valuation adjustment and modifications to the complexity and interconnectedness categories of the G-SIB surcharge, following analysis that the current proposals would increase capital for client clearing businesses at US G-SIBs by more than 80%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on top of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/05/isda-submits-letter-to-us-agencies-on-slr-reform/">letter we sent to US prudential regulators</a>&nbsp;earlier this year drawing attention to the fact that the non-risk-based supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) may impede banks&rsquo; capacity to participate in US Treasury markets and facilitate access to cleared markets, especially during periods of stress. We believe this is something that should be carefully assessed by regulators.</p>
<p>All of these issues need to be resolved before we&rsquo;re in a position to implement Treasury clearing safely and efficiently. The question is whether they can be completed in the time available, and this is something we&rsquo;ll be discussing with members in the coming months. In the meantime, we encourage all market participants to engage with the relevant working groups at ISDA or elsewhere &ndash; everyone will need to work together to get this done.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson: Prioritizing Customer Protection And Combatting Fraud By FTX And Alameda</title>

<div> Commodity Futures Trading Commission, historic judgment, FTX Trading Ltd., Alameda Research LLC, fraud <br />
Summary:<br />Today, the CFTC announced a historic $12.7 billion settlement with FTX and Alameda for fraud, lack of customer protections, and conflicts of interest. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>Introduction</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Today, in a historic judgment with a $12.7 billion settlement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) announced the entry of a consent order in its litigation against FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX) and Alameda Research LLC (Alameda). Today&rsquo;s announcement sends a clear message regarding the Commission&rsquo;s intent to hold fraudsters accountable. The consent order, entered by Judge P. Kevin Castel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against FTX and Alameda filed on December 13, 2022.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;The amended complaint charged defendants with two counts of fraud and material misrepresentations in connection with the sale of digital assets and alleged that defendants&rsquo; actions caused the loss of billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FTX and Alameda have agreed to findings of liability on each of the charges alleged in the amended complaint. The consent order, among other obligations, imposes:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>$8.7 billion in restitution;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>$4 billion in disgorgement;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A permanent injunction prohibiting FTX and Alameda from engaging in further violations of the charged Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A permanent injunction prohibiting FTX and Alameda from trading for themselves or others, soliciting or accepting funds for trading, registering or claiming an exemption from registration with the Commission in any capacity, or acting as a principal of any registered person.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>The total restitution and disgorgement amount of $12.7 billion is a historic judgment that will enable the Commission to compensate victims for the losses they suffered as a result of this massive fraud.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s resolution demonstrates the Commission&rsquo;s strong commitment to achieving accountability, deterring future misconduct, and promoting compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations. The resolution sends a clear message that fraud in the derivatives markets will not be tolerated and that wrongdoers will be held accountable.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I commend the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement and the Commission on today&rsquo;s landmark resolution. Yet, much work is left to be done. Going forward, we must prioritize efforts to protect customers in markets with regulatory gaps, where customers may be at higher risk due to the absence of adequate safeguards.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have called on the Commission before, and I do so again today, to take urgent action to adopt a holistic rule that directly addresses concerns such as conflicts of interest, risk management, transparency and oversight.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Every market for every asset subject to the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction must have effective customer protections including, for example, segregation of customer funds, property, and assets.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Customer Protection Rules are the Cornerstone of Vibrant Derivatives Markets and a Well-Functioning Financial System</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The vibrancy of derivatives markets depends on customers&rsquo; ability to trust that their funds will be safely held by custodians. Customers must be assured that their hard-earned money will not be misused, lost, or worse yet, stolen, by those whom they have entrusted with its safekeeping. In the absence of trust, the custodial relationship cannot thrive, derivatives markets suffer, and the entire financial system is harmed. Customer protection rules, in particular those rules protecting customer funds, are therefore crucial to the vibrancy of derivatives markets and a well-functioning financial system.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span>As directed by the CEA, the Commission has developed, adopted, and implemented rules that protect customers in derivatives markets, including rules that protect customer funds, property, and other assets</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;held by a custodian. Such rules require custodians to segregate and separately account for customer funds. A custodian may not commingle customer funds.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As additional safety measures, custodians must also meet certain minimum capital requirements, file periodic and annual financial reports, maintain books and records, be subject to examinations, and comply with a host of other obligations. These measures are intended to promote transparency, monitor and manage risks, and enable oversight over the activities of custodians.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Notwithstanding the Commission&rsquo;s customer protection rules and efforts to preserve customer funds, customers have experienced significant losses in both heavily regulated markets as well as emerging markets, such as in the digital asset and cryptocurrency space. The rise of retail participation in emerging markets adds to the urgency of ensuring that customer funds are protected and that the integrity and stability of our markets is maintained.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>An Absence of Customer Protection Rules and Gaps in Regulation Enabled FTX to Misappropriate Billions of Dollars in Customer Funds</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On November 11, 2022, customers and our markets experienced the devastating effects of the precipitous collapse and shocking bankruptcy of FTX, which resulted in the loss of over $10 billion in customer funds.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Investigations into FTX&rsquo;s demise revealed a concerning lack of customer protections, including commingling of customer funds, using customer funds to extend a line of credit to an affiliate, and investing customer funds in nonpermitted investments through an affiliate, among others. Customers and the public were not alerted to FTX&rsquo;s ongoing misconduct due to the absence of crucial regulation over digital assets needed to establish appropriate risk management mechanisms to address conflicts of interest and other related issues, a lack of transparency, and inadequate oversight.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Conflicts of Interest Plagued FTX and Alameda</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>From the beginning, FTX and Alameda had significant conflicts of interest issues stemming from their vertically-integrated market structure. A gap in regulation, however, allowed these issues to go unaddressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Bankman-Fried founded Alameda in November 2017, as a digital asset trading and investment firm. In late 2018, he and other Alameda employees began to build what would ultimately become FTX, a centralized digital asset trading platform. Once FTX was launched, no later than May 2019, Alameda began operating as the primary market maker on FTX&rsquo;s trading platform. Bankman-Fried controlled both FTX and Alameda, serving as a signatory on core corporate agreements and bank accounts for both entities. Throughout their operations, FTX and Alameda regularly shared employees, office space, systems, communication channels, and accounts. FTX and Alameda relied on each other&rsquo;s personnel, assets and resources to conduct their operations. FTX and Alameda also regularly transferred large amounts of assets between the entities, often without documentation or effective tracking.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have raised the alarm, time and time again, about conflicts of interest and other concerns in emerging asset classes and the urgent need for the Commission to adopt a holistic rule that addresses these issues.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Segregation and Restrictions on the Use and Investment of Customer Funds are Fundamental Customer Protections</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At the core of customer protection rules is the fundamental principle that custodians must segregate and separately account for customer funds that they receive to margin, guarantee or secure the trades of the customer. A custodian is strictly prohibited from commingling customer funds with its own funds and from using or investing customer funds in violation of the CEA and Commission regulations.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Transparency and Oversight are Crucial to Detecting and Preventing Misconduct</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Disclosures, reporting and examinations are critical to creating transparency into business operations and functions and enabling customers and the public to have proper oversight over business conduct. It is imperative that the Commission and other regulators have proper oversight and transparency into the digital asset and cryptocurrency ecosystem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On November 11, 2022, FTX and more than 100 of its affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. FTX&rsquo;s collapse unleashed a wave of failures across the digital asset and cryptocurrency ecosystem and left numerous customers with devastating losses.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On December 13, 2022, in the criminal case parallel to the Commission&rsquo;s civil case, the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Bankman-Fried on eight counts, including fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span>In November 2023, jurors found Bankman-Fried guilty of misappropriating billions of dollars in customer funds deposited with FTX. Bankman-Fried was convicted of two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. On March 28, 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in this massive fraud scheme and has begun serving his sentence.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FTX&rsquo;s failure and the catastrophic consequences of its collapse confirm that there is no time to waste. The time is now for the Commission to adopt a comprehensive rule addressing customer protections.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I commend the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, including Carlin Metzger, Nina Ruvinsky, Yusuf Capar, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R. Williamson, and Robert T. Howell, for their work on this matter.</span></span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Obtains $12.7 Billion Judgment Against FTX And Alameda - Restitution And Disgorgement Damages To Pay Fraud Victims</title>

<div> CFTC, FTX, fraud, injunction, restitution
Summary:<br /><br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission obtained a $12.7 billion judgment against FTX for fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The judgment includes restitution and disgorgement. FTX falsely represented its safety and security to customers. The CFTC will not seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX and will subordinate its monetary claims to those of the victims of the FTX fraud scheme. The CFTC complaint charged Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX, and two former FTX executives with orchestrating a scheme to defraud. The court entered consent orders of judgment on liability against two former FTX executives, leaving the case pending as to the four individual defendants including Bankman-Fried. The CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded victims, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a consent order of permanent injunction and other equitable relief against&nbsp;FTX Trading Ltd.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alameda Research LLC&nbsp;(together, FTX) and ordered FTX to pay $12.7 billion in monetary relief to FTX customers and victims of FTX&rsquo;s fraud. The order requires FTX to pay $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered as a result of the massive fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Samuel Bankman-Fried, his now-bankrupt FTX group of companies, and a core group of FTX insiders. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8638-22">8638-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8644-22">8644-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23">8669-23</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the order finds FTX violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, imposes injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations as well as trading and registration prohibitions, and requires FTX and Alameda to cooperate with the CFTC in its ongoing litigation. The order finds FTX and Alameda made material misrepresentations and omissions to customers. The court noted that FTX touted itself as &ldquo;the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto,&rdquo; and that customer assets, including digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, were held in &ldquo;custody&rdquo; by FTX while stating FTX segregated customer assets from FTX&rsquo;s own assets as a general principle, when in fact customer funds were commingled and misappropriated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a related settlement agreement approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the CFTC agreed not to seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX and to subordinate its monetary claims to those of victims of the FTX fraud scheme. As described by FTX in its proposed reorganization plan filed in the bankruptcy proceeding, payments by FTX towards its CFTC disgorgement obligation will be used to further compensate victims through a supplemental remission fund. The plan remains subject to approval in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>FTX used age-old tactics to create an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets. But the basic regulatory tools, like governance, customer protections, and surveillance that exist to identify misconduct and ultimately prevent collapse, were simply not there,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like countless other CFTC crypto resolutions, including major players&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8837-23">Binance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8412-21">BitMEX</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21">Tether</a>, this resolution with FTX is consistent with the enforcement commitments I have long made as Chairman. But, as I have been saying for years, this is just the tip of the iceberg. In the absence of digital asset legislation to fill regulatory gaps, entities will continue to operate in the shadows without these basic tools of sound regulation, sharpening their deceptive practices and continuing to dupe customers."</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement Director Ian McGinley added,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only is this multi-billion dollar recovery for victims the largest such recovery in CFTC history, we achieved it with remarkable speed. FTX&rsquo;s massive fraud collapsed 21 months ago and in that time the CFTC investigated, filed a complaint, and achieved what many thought was impossible at the time of the collapse - a resolution to compensate victims for the losses they suffered. I commend our Chicago-based team for their tireless efforts on behalf of FTX&rsquo;s victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The consent order stems from the CFTC complaint filed December 13, 2022 against Bankman-Fried and FTX, and amended December 21, 2022, to include two former FTX executives, Caroline Ellison and Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang. The CFTC complaint charged Bankman-Fried, who controlled FTX and Alameda, with orchestrating a scheme to defraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court entered consent orders of judgment on liability against Wang and Ellison on December 23, 2022. In a related case, the court entered a consent order of judgment as to liability and partial injunctive relief against Nishad Singh, a third FTX insider, on April 13, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against FTX, leaving the case pending as to the four individual defendants including Bankman-Fried. In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded victims, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Tax Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Carlin Metzger, Nina Ruvinsky, Yusuf Capar, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R. Williamson, Robert T. Howell, Gretchen Lowe, and former staff member Bryan Hsueh.</p>
<p>Alex Case, Margaret Aisenbrey, and Anne Stukes of the Office of General Counsel also contributed to this matter.</p>

The Group aims to raise 70 million euros to finance the Company's next growth phase by issuing 1.750.000.000 new shares.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img title="One Verdi Park, One United Properties landmark residential development in Bucharest, Romania" /></p>
</div>
<p><i>"Since becoming a public company, we have consistently delivered on the promises made to our investors, with a clear focus on expanding our business. Our successful IPO in 2021 was a pivotal moment that enabled our strategic expansion into the premium residential segment, exemplified by the remarkable success of One Cotroceni Park. Similarly, our office division, which now boasts a 95% lease ratio, has fulfilled our commitment to investors, driven by our belief that Bucharest deserves world-class office spaces to establish itself as a leading European work hub. Today, our construction sites span 12 developments, comprising more than 4,000 residential units and nearly 45,000 sqm of office and commercial spaces. Our vision for the future includes entering the affordable premium housing segment, where we see significant growth potential. The planned share capital increase is the next milestone for this growth, and we invite our esteemed shareholders to participate and increase their investment in One United Properties by approximately 10% of their existing holdings. This capital infusion accelerates our ambitious growth plans, positioning us to double our business within the next five years and potentially quadruple it over the next decade, while maintaining our LTV at a prudent level,"&nbsp;</i>said Victor Capitanu, co-CEO of One United Properties.</p>
<p>The share capital increase operation will be organized in two stages. In the first stage, the shareholders who purchased ONE shares by the date of guaranteed participation, August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024, will be entitled to subscribe the new shares, respecting the preference rights, at the nominal value of 0.2 lei. The preference rights, having symbol ONER03, were loaded in the shareholders' accounts on August 7<sup>th</sup>. The preference right will be tradeable on the Main Market of the Bucharest Stock Exchange between August 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 13<sup>th</sup>. Therefore, those who want to subscribe to new shares but do not have any or sufficient preference rights will be able to buy them at the price set in the market.</p>
<p>The first stage of the share capital increase will start on August 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and will last for 32 calendar days, until September 19<sup>th</sup>. To subscribe to one new share in stage 1 of the share capital increase at 0.2 lei, an investor must hold 2,1879186 ONER03 preference rights. The shares that remain unsubscribed during the first stage might be offered in a private placement at a price established by the Board of Directors decision, considering the price formed during the bookbuilding process.</p>
<p>60% of the capital intended to be raised by the Company has already been committed by the two co-founders and executive members of the Board of Directors, Victor Capitanu and Andrei Diaconescu, as well as the Chairman of the Board, Claudio Cisullo and Board Member, Marius Diaconu.</p>
<p>The capital raised in the share capital increase operation will be used to expand One United Properties' addressable market beyond its current residential segment focus of luxury, high-end, and premium developments and will accelerate the development of the affordable premium residential segment, which targets Bucharest's middle class. The Company has land under negotiation for 10,000 residential units exclusively for this sub-segment, with the first memorandum of understanding for a 21-hectare plot of land that will host 5,000 units already signed.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, One United Properties sold and pre-sold 452 apartments and commercial units with a total surface of 43,809 sqm, 624 parking spaces, and other unit types for 123.3 million euros. At the end of May 2024, pre-sales started at the second phase of One Lake District, where 867 units are being built. Consequently, as of June 30th, 2024, 66% of the available units under development and delivered were sold out.</p>
<p>As of June 30th, 2024, One United Properties had&nbsp;in ownership, or under pre-SPA, 285,100 sqm&nbsp;of land locations for further development, with total above-ground gross building rights (GBA) of approximately 988,000 sqm. All these land plots are currently in the planning phase. The Group estimates the construction of&nbsp;7,000 apartments, services for communities, and 146,000 sqm of rental commercial buildings.&nbsp;Out of the commercial buildings, 121,000 sqm will host offices and the remaining 25,000 sqm are located within buildings that will undergo restoration.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Progresses Framework For Driving Long-Term Value For Workplace Pension Savers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-progresses-framework-for-driving-long-term-value/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Regulatory framework, pension schemes, transparency, value, performance
Regulatory bodies propose a new framework to focus on long-term value and performance, not just costs, ultimately providing better retirement savings.<br /><br />Summary:
The Financial Conduct Authority, Department for Work and Pensions, and Pensions Regulator are collaborating to implement a new framework focusing on long-term value and performance for pension schemes. <div>
<p align="left">Pensions savers stand to benefit from a new proposed framework designed to shift the focus from costs to long term value, and ultimately deliver better retirement savings. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Pensions Regulator (TPR) aim to implement a joint framework for workplace defined contribution schemes.</p>
<p align="left">The joint framework would be used by pension providers and those making decisions on behalf of savers to provide greater transparency over how schemes are performing.</p>
<p align="left">Schemes will be compared on public metrics that demonstrate value &ndash; not just costs and charges, but also investment performance, and service quality. They would, once the final framework is decided, be publicly rated red, amber or green.</p>
<p align="left">Poorly performing schemes will be required to improve or ultimately protect savers by transferring them to better schemes. This should lead to better value pensions, without savers themselves having to take action.</p>
<p align="left">The proposals will also support the FCA&rsquo;s secondary growth and competitiveness objective. Focusing on value rather than costs will enable providers to invest in assets which could deliver greater long-term returns but have higher management costs, such as infrastructure or venture capital.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Markets and International at the FCA</strong>, said:</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;16 million people save for their retirement into defined contribution pension schemes. We&rsquo;re working with the government and the Pensions Regulator to help them get better returns.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We want to see a focus on long-term value, not just costs and charges. Given the impact these changes could have we are consulting now to ensure that the pension system can be ready to go when the legislative changes that need to happen are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Emma Reynolds MP, Minister for Pensions</strong>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Last year, over &pound;130 billion was saved into workplace pension schemes &ndash; money which we want to see working hard for future pensioners to give them better retirement incomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Our Pension Bill and Pensions Review will make pensions fit for the future, and having an effective Value for Money framework will lay the foundations for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"I would encourage responses from across the industry, including trust-based schemes, to this consultation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Nausicaa Delfas, Chief Executive of The Pensions Regulator</strong>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We want every pension saver to get value for money from their pensions. That means good investment returns, and high-quality services, for a competitive price.&nbsp; This is a great opportunity for the pensions industry to help to transform pension saving for millions, and to deliver greater value for their retirement.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The FCA is seeking feedback on the framework for pension schemes it regulates. The Government has recently announced its intention to legislate so that the framework can also apply to schemes regulated by TPR, and feedback is also invited in relation to these schemes. Responses will be shared with the Government and TPR to support swift development of a consistent approach once legislation is in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The framework is one of a number of joint initiatives to deliver better outcomes for pension savers including the Advice Guidance Boundary Review and the Pensions Dashboard.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A copy of the consultation paper is available to journalists only, on request from the press office.</li>
<li><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/feedback-statements/fs23-3-government-regulator-response-value-money-framework-metrics-standards-disclosures" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FS23/3: Government-regulator response to &lsquo;Value for Money: A framework on metrics, standards and disclosures&rsquo;</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA regulates contract-based pensions, which involve a contract between an individual and the pension provider</li>
<li>TPR regulates trust-based pension schemes, which have a board of trustees overseeing the scheme</li>
<li>The Government has recently announced its intention for a Pension Schemes Bill which includes legislating for the VFM framework to apply across the market, including schemes regulated by TPR, alongside other measures when Parliamentary time allows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

India's VC landscape in H1 2024 sees 45.3% increase in funding value, with larger investments and declining deal volume. India ranks high globally.<br />
Investors' confidence in Indian startups<br />
572 VC deals worth $5.6 billion in H1 2024<br />
India accounts for 7% global VC deals, 4.4% funding value<br />
Summary: India's VC landscape in H1 2024 reflects larger investments, declining deal volume, and growing global standing, indicating confidence in Indian startups. <div>
<p><span><span>India&rsquo;s venture capital (VC) landscape during the first half (H1) of 2024 highlights a strategic shift towards relatively larger investments, as reflected by the 45.3% increase in disclosed funding value year-on-year (YoY) despite a 2.1% drop in deal volume. This trend signifies investors&rsquo; growing confidence in high-potential startups, with significant deals like Zepto&rsquo;s $665 million and Meesho&rsquo;s $300 million fundraisings pointing to a robust future for the Indian startup ecosystem, says&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.b00YhNV2Nr0-2BaZn7eVNAdXV19MDZH7kb0yQVOf6WtC8eObQvQmU18OGm4LpUDS-2BPjOqK_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7C3K7RHp5Gm5XPA4ohOQ9tAuGjMYZPJBg8hgZ6p1U8S2f8AYJJJhbVbcQAPDEXY5yyigHMydLCriGxP6JYurFEC51QJuUIuipw5rPDWc7I7VOSHeYH-2BBiiQ7CjUBRhbTP48sckB2M280h-2FchqsuiATg-2FM-2FrT23GpBAOXlKr2c3TOiufKjlSUH0GvLKggUORRlK-2FzCwFlwVQdp94zZWnU2mCqANgo-2BBrjwl-2BHhoMhX5b78-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The massive jump in VC funding value despite a decline in deal volume can be seen as an indicator of improving investors&rsquo; appetite for big investments while also adopting a cautious approach. This can also be understood from the fact that the average size of VC deals increased from $6.5 million in H1 2023 to $9.7 million in H1 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in India during H1 2024 include $665 million worth of funding raised by Zepto, $300 million raised by Meesho, $216 million raised by PharmEasy, $150 million raised by Radiance, and $148 million raised by Kogta Financia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose adds: &ldquo;India, apart from being a leading APAC market for VC funding activity and standing just next to China in terms of both deals volume as well as value, is also among the top five markets globally.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>India accounted for 7% share of the total number of VC funding deals announced globally during H1 2024 while its share of the corresponding disclosed funding value stood at 4.4%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;As investors continue to pour substantial funding into promising startups, it underscores the improving confidence in India&rsquo;s market potential. This not only bolsters the country&rsquo;s standing in the global VC landscape but also sets the stage for a vibrant and resilient startup ecosystem poised for dynamic growth in the coming years.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<div> Derivatives, Volume, Growth, SDAV, STI
Summary:<br />Derivatives volume rose 15% y-o-y. FX futures reached record volume. New interest-rate hedging tools introduced. Commodities and equity derivatives also gained. SDAV and STI outpaced peers. Mainboard listing welcomed. <div>
<ul type="square">
<li><span>Derivatives volume rises as global investors turn to our marketplaces to manage risk amid heightened volatility</span></li>
<li><span>SDAV growth and STI outpace peers across Southeast Asia</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for July 2024. Activity in SGX Group&rsquo;s marketplaces increased across asset classes as global investors managed portfolio risks in response to manifold economic and political developments during a volatile month. Derivatives traded volume gained 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 23.5 million contracts.</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, SGX Group&rsquo;s Japan-access derivatives suite enabled market participants to manage risk around Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions. As the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate and announced plans to slow its monthly bond purchases, the volume of SGX three-month Tokyo Overnight Average (TONA) Futures topped 532 lots following the contract&rsquo;s debut on 29 July, while month-end open interest (OI) in SGX Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures rose 21% month-on-month (m-o-m). In addition, the pioneering SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures saw 52,504 lots (US$6.8 billion notional) traded on 31 July &ndash; up 36% over the daily average for the month.</p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Record FX futures volume:&nbsp;</span>total futures traded volume on SGX FX climbed 44% y-o-y in July to 4.8 million contracts, an all-time high. Gains were led by SGX USD/CNH FX Futures &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most widely traded international renminbi futures &ndash; with volume up 40% y-o-y at a record 2.9 million contracts, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 48% y-o-y to 1.6 million contracts. Anticipation of rate decisions by the BOJ and the Federal Reserve, as well as uncertainties over the U.S. presidential elections, fuelled volatility and bolstered portfolio hedging.</li>
<li><span>New interest-rate hedging tools with focus on central banks:&nbsp;</span>SGX Fixed Income&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20240312-sgx-group-launch-interest-rate-derivatives-2h-2024">launched</a>&nbsp;three-month TONA and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) Futures on 29 July, as investors seek more accessible and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. The contracts build upon SGX&rsquo;s offering of long-term interest rate futures comprising 10-year Full-Sized and Mini JGB futures.</li>
<li><span>Broad-based commodities gains, with record dairy OI:</span>&nbsp;Commodity derivatives traded volume rose 20% y-o-y in July to 5.1 million contracts, with bellwether iron ore derivatives volume up 22% y-o-y on elevated risk management amid diverse views on China&rsquo;s growth outlook. Over the first seven months of 2024, 13.3 million metric tonnes (MT) of petrochemicals derivatives have traded on SGX Commodities, close to the 13.4 million MT cleared in all of 2023. Dairy derivatives OI set a single-day record of 171,335 lots on 16 July, rounding off the month with a record average of 106,386 lots.</li>
<li><span>Highest SIMSCI OI notional value in more than four years:</span>&nbsp;OI in SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures rose 42% y-o-y in July to 221,551 lots, with notional value surpassing US$5 billion for the first time since January 2020 amid strong buyside interest in safe-haven markets. SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures volume gained 15% y-o-y, as overnight volumes climbed to a peak of 53,029 lots (US$4.1 billion notional) on 18 July following the release of chipmaker TSMC&rsquo;s earnings. On SGX Equity Derivatives, total equity index futures volume increased 5% y-o-y to 13.1 million contracts.</li>
<li><span>SDAV growth leads region:</span>&nbsp;Securities daily average value (SDAV) rose 13% y-o-y and 4% m-o-m in July to S$1.2 billion against declines across Southeast Asia, with higher retail activity across stock segments. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 3.7% m-o-m to 3,455.94, also outpacing peers across ASEAN and Developed Asia, with year-to-date returns of 6.7%. During the month, Singapore&rsquo;s stock market remained the second most-actively traded in Southeast Asia. Total securities market turnover value increased 23% y-o-y and 26% m-o-m to S$26.5 billion.</li>
<li><span>Record REIT ETF turnover:</span>&nbsp;The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) jumped 48% m-o-m in July to S$404 million. For real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, active participation from retail and robo-advisors lifted trading to a record S$131 million. Turnover of daily leverage certificates (DLC) surged 36% m-o-m to S$219 million, with Singapore-underlying DLCs showing the most increases.</li>
<li><span>Mainboard listing:&nbsp;</span>SGX Securities welcomed the secondary listing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20240719-sgx-securities-welcomes-helens-international-holdings-company">Helens International Holdings Company Limited</a>&nbsp;on Mainboard on 19 July. The company runs one of the largest bar chain networks in the PRC.</li>

<p><em>* Adjusted EBITDA, NPAT and EPS exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring items that have less bearing on SGX Group&rsquo;s operating performance.

<p><em>All figures are for the year except for figures in brackets, which are for the year earlier unless otherwise stated. Figures&nbsp;may be subject to rounding.</em></p>
<p><em>The presentation of revenue has been revised in FY2024 to the following four operating segments &ndash; Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities; Equities &ndash; Cash; Equities &ndash; Derivatives; and Platform and Others. FY2023 revenue has been reclassified to the four operating segments for a like-for-like comparison against FY2024</em><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1"><em><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today reported FY2024 adjusted net profit of S$525.9 million, 4.5% higher from the previous year (S$503.2 million).&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA was up at S$711.6 million (S$688.6 million), while adjusted earnings per share was 49.2 cents (47.1 cents).</p>
<p>Revenue increased 3.1% to S$1,231.7 million (S$1,194.4 million), mainly driven by higher revenues from Currencies and Commodities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;and Platform and Others, partially offset by lower Equities &ndash; Cash<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Equities &ndash; Derivatives<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has proposed a final quarterly dividend of 9.0 cents (8.5 cents) per share, payable on 25 October 2024, for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. If approved, this represents an annualised increase of 5.9%.</p>
<p>Loh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, &ldquo;Our multi-asset strategy has yielded positive results over the years and will remain our core differentiator. Revenue growth in FY2024 was led by strong volumes in our currencies and commodities businesses as we expanded our customer base and drove higher activity. Our currencies and commodities franchises are on a healthy growth momentum with volumes doubling over the last three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our equities businesses showed stronger activity in the second half of the financial year, with equity derivatives daily average volume and securities daily average value increasing 11% and 21% half-on-half respectively. We are pushing ahead with our efforts to increase market participation, product development and adoption, as well as cross-border connectivity.&nbsp; At the same time, we will work closely with the Review Group set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore,&rdquo; added Mr. Loh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) segment has delivered more than 20% CAGR in the last three years<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn3">[3]</a>. Commodities daily average volume (DAV) grew 50% to about 240,000 contracts in FY2024, driven mainly by broadening participation in our iron ore futures contracts during the overnight T+1 session. Looking ahead, the next phase of growth for commodities will be anchored on synergies between our ferrous and freight offering.</p>
<p>Our OTC FX average daily volume well surpassed our target with a 47% increase to reach US$111 billion in FY2024, while our currency futures DAV grew 36% to about 204,000 contracts. Our OTC FX business is projected to contribute mid-to-high single digit percent of Group EBITDA in the medium term, compared to around 3% of Group EBITDA in FY2024.</p>
<p>In the medium term, we aim to grow Group revenue (excluding treasury income) between 6-8% CAGR. This will be driven mainly by low to mid-teens percentage growth in our OTC FX and exchange traded derivatives businesses. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage as group expense growth<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;is expected to be in the low to mid-single digit percentage CAGR in the medium term.</p>
<p><span>Results Summary</span></p>
<p><span>Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC)</span></p>
<p>FICC revenue increased 22.3% to S$322.5 million (S$263.6 million) and accounted for 26.2% (22.1%) of total revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$75.7 million, up 8.3% from S$69.9 million</li>
</ul>
<p>Trading and clearing revenue grew by S$52.9 million, mainly from increased volumes in commodity derivatives and OTC FX transactions<em>.</em></p>
<p>Commodity derivatives volumes increased&nbsp;50.2% to&nbsp;61.5 million contracts (41.0 million contracts), mainly due to higher volumes in iron ore derivatives.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Currency derivatives volumes increased 34.2% to 49.2 million contracts (36.7 million contracts), mainly due to higher volumes in USD/CNH FX futures contracts.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTC FX headline average daily volume (ADV)&nbsp;increased 46.6% to US$111.1&nbsp;billion (US$75.8 billion) due to an increase in swaps activities.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Equities &ndash; Cash</span></p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Cash revenue&nbsp;declined by 2.1% to S$334.9 million (S$342.1 million) and accounted for&nbsp;27.2% (28.6%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue: S$137.1 million, up 1.0% from S$135.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>We recorded 7 (8) new equity listings which raised S$117.0 million (S$37.6 million). Secondary equity funds raised were S$1.2 billion (S$4.8 billion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securities daily average traded value (SDAV) declined&nbsp;3.9% to S$1.06 billion (S$1.10 billion) and total securities traded value declined&nbsp;4.2% to S$263.7 billion (S$275.5 billion). This was made up of Cash Equities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, where traded value decreased&nbsp;by 3.8% to S$253.2 billion (S$263.2 billion), and Other Products<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, where traded value&nbsp;decreased 13.9% to S$10.5 billion (S$12.2 billion).

<p>Overall average clearing fees remained comparable at 2.49 basis points (bps) (2.49 bps). Turnover velocity (primary-listed) was 37.5% (37.4%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue was mainly&nbsp;due to higher interest income from handling of corporate actions, partially offset by lower number of settlement instructions.</p>
<p><span>Equities &ndash; Derivatives&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives revenue declined&nbsp;7.5% to S$334.0 million (S$361.3 million) and accounted for&nbsp;27.1% (30.2%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$256.1 million, down&nbsp;9.0% from S$281.6 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$77.9 million, down&nbsp;2.2% from S$79.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The decline in trading and clearing revenue was driven by a&nbsp;7.7% decline in total equity derivatives volumes, mainly from declines in volumes of our GIFT Nifty,&nbsp;<a>FTSE China A50&nbsp;</a>and Nikkei 225 index futures contracts, partially offset by higher volumes of our FTSE Taiwan index futures contracts. Excluding Nifty, trading and clearing revenue increased 0.5%.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Average Fees</span></p>
<p>Average fee per contract for Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives was 4.3% lower at S$1.54 (S$1.61) mainly driven by decline in average fee of our GIFT Nifty index futures contracts, due to the reclassification of NSE fee arrangement from expense to revenue as part of GIFT Connect. On a pro forma basis, FY2024 average fee per contract declined at a lower rate of 1.1% to S$1.54 (S$1.56).</p>
<p><span>Platform and Others&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Platform and Others revenue increased 5.6% to S$240.2 million (S$227.4 million) and accounted for&nbsp;19.5% (19.0%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Market data revenue: S$47.9 million, up&nbsp;9.0% from S$44.0 million</li>
<li>Connectivity revenue: S$77.2 million, up&nbsp;9.0% from S$70.8 million</li>
<li>Indices and other revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>: S$115.1 million, up&nbsp;2.2% from S$112.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in Market data revenue was mainly driven by repricing and increase in number of data licence subscribers<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in Connectivity revenue was mainly due to repricing and higher number of subscription of our co-location services.</p>
<p>Indices and other revenue increased mainly due to higher revenue contribution from Index Edge, Baltic Exchange and<em>&nbsp;</em>EMC, partially offset by decline in revenue from Scientific Beta.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Expenses Overview</span></p>
<p>Total expenses increased 3.4% to S$625.3 million (S$604.9 million), mainly from higher staff costs and one-time provision to fund initiatives targeted at improving the vibrancy of the Securities Market, offset by lower processing and royalties and professional fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusted total expenses increased 2.5% to S$604.0 million (S$589.3 million), excluding the one-time provision, amortisation of purchased intangible assets, and others.</p>
<p>We have been prudent in managing our cost base even as we invested for growth, particularly in the OTC FX business. Our Group expenses have grown in line with our medium-term guidance of mid-single digit percentage CAGR over the past three years.</p>
<p>We expect FY2025 expenses (excluding transaction-based expenses, i.e. processing and royalties) to grow 2-4% year-on-year. This will be achieved by measured pace of headcount growth, improving operational efficiency and realising savings from the completion of the migration of our OTC FX data centre.</p>
<p><span>Non-operating Items</span></p>
<p>Non-operating items were higher at S$117.1 million (S$99.8 million), driven largely by fair value gain from our investment in 7Ridge and higher net interest income, partially offset by higher impairment losses.</p>
<p><span>Capital Expenditure Overview</span></p>
<p>Total capital expenditure was S$66.0 million (S$59.4 million). These investments include modernisation of our technology infrastructure and consolidation of our office spaces.</p>
<p>FY2025 capital expenditure is expected to be S$70-75 million as we invest in the modernisation of our securities system and infrastructure upgrade. Beyond FY2025, capital expenditure is expected to further increase due to continued investments into the modernisation of our exchange trading and clearing platforms, and data centre. Over the next cycle, capital expenditure is anticipated to remain below the historical average of 7% of Group revenue.</p>

<p align="justify"><span>Webcast and Conference Call Information</span></p>
<p align="justify">Robinhood will host a conference call to discuss its results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today, August&nbsp;7, 2024. The live webcast of Robinhood's earnings conference call can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>, along with the earnings press release and accompanying slide presentation.</p>
<p align="justify">Following the call, a replay and transcript will also be available at the same website.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Financial Outlook</span></p>
<p align="justify">Our 2024 expense plan includes growth investments in new products, features, and international expansion while also getting more efficient in our existing businesses. Our outlook for both GAAP total operating expenses and Non-GAAP combined Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC for full-year 2024 is unchanged at $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion.</p>
<p align="justify">Actual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>

The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>
<p align="justify"><span><br />Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</span></p>
<p align="justify">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected financial performance of Robinhood Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;Robinhood,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and our strategic and operational plans, including (among others) statements regarding that with Robinhood Gold reaching 2 million subscribers, we&rsquo;re witnessing the flywheel accelerate; that we continue to focus on delivering another year of profitable growth; that management currently expects to execute a $1 billion share repurchase program over a two to three year period; that Robinhood will be hosting its first-ever customer-focused conference, happening October 16-18, 2024; and all statements and information under the headings &ldquo;Financial Outlook&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Outlook.&rdquo; Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;will&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;target,&rdquo; &ldquo;project,&rdquo; &ldquo;contemplate,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;predict,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential,&rdquo; or &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this press release. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our limited operating experience at our current scale; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of continued declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (&ldquo;PFOF&rdquo;), and the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations; the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies, and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and processes; the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes; the risk that our platforms and services could be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on August 8, 2024, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, all of which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">www.sec.gov</a>. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, August&nbsp;7, 2024 and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p>
<p align="justify">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss) and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo;), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.</p>
<p align="justify">The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA Margin</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income (loss) divided by total net revenues). We believe Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. We believe Adjusted Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves and (ii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC. We believe Adjusted Operating Expense and SBC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Key Performance Metrics</span></p>
<p align="justify">In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Funded Customers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Assets Under Custody (&ldquo;AUC&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets transferred out of our platforms (assets transferred in or out include debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and custodial crypto wallet transfers) for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Average Revenue Per User (&ldquo;ARPU&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this release represent ARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Gold Subscribers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Additional Operating Metrics</span></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Retirement AUC</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Retirement AUC as the total AUC in traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Cash Sweep</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total amount of participating users&rsquo; uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically &ldquo;swept&rdquo; or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Margin Book</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Notional Trading Volume</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Options Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Monthly Active Users ("MAU")</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define MAUs as the number of unique persons who, using one or more accounts with a Robinhood entity, meet one of the following criteria at any point during a specified calendar month: a) executes a debit card or credit card transaction, b) transitions between two different screens on a mobile device while logged into their account or c) loads a page in a web browser while logged into their account. A person need not satisfy these conditions on a recurring monthly basis or be a Funded Customer to be included in MAU. MAU figures in this release reflect MAU for the last month of the relevant period presented. We utilize MAU to measure how many customers interact with our products and services during a given month. MAU does not measure the frequency or duration of the interaction, but we consider it a useful indicator for engagement. Additionally, MAUs are positively correlated with, but are not indicative of, the performance of revenue and other key performance indicators.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Glossary Terms</span></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Investment Accounts</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account or a funded individual retirement account ("IRA"). As of June 30, 2024, a Funded Customer can have up to three Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">When used with respect to Net Deposits, &ldquo;growth rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;annualized growth rate&rdquo; provide information about Net Deposits relative to total AUC. &ldquo;Growth rate&rdquo; is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period. &ldquo;Annualized growth rate&rdquo; is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the immediately preceding quarter.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Results From Its First Fact Finding Exercise On Creditworthiness Assessment Practices Of Non-Bank Lenders</title>

<div> Report, creditworthiness assessment, non-bank lenders, EBA, consumer trends<br />
<br />
The EBA published a report on non-bank lenders' creditworthiness assessment practices, finding inadequate practices, lack of harmonization, and increased consumer credit. The EBA will continue monitoring NBL activities. <br /><br />Summary: The EBA report highlights inadequate creditworthiness assessment practices by non-bank lenders, lack of harmonization, increased consumer credit, and the need for ongoing monitoring. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the results of a fact finding exercise on the creditworthiness assessment (CWA) practices of non-bank lenders (NBLs). The exercise is a follow-up to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-identifies-fraud-retail-payments-and-over-indebtedness"><span>Consumer Trends Report</span></a><span>&nbsp;published in April 2023 and aimed at gaining insight into the extent to which NBLs contribute to over-indebtedness and arrears. The EBA finds that,&nbsp;while some NBLs might service segments of the population that may have limited opportunities to access traditional banks for credit, a significant number of the surveyed NBLs appear to apply inadequate practices for information gathering and verification during their CWAs.</span></p>
<p>The Report also finds that the lack of a harmonised definition of NBLs and a harmonised authorisation framework in the EU contribute to different types of NBLs being supervised in different ways across EU Member States. Consequently, different rules apply to entities that are of a similar kind across the EU.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Report finds that many National Competent Authorities have taken supervisory actions in respect of NBLs, but the surge in the number and significance of these entities increases the need for specialised resources dedicated to the monitoring of non-bank lending activities.</p>
<p>In terms of market trends, the Report shows that the proportion of credit granted under the Consumer Credit Directive by the surveyed NBLs between 2020 and 2023 overall increased, with a peak of 43% in 2021. In the same period, the proportion of loans granted under the Mortgage Credit Directive by the surveyed NBLs decreased from 58% to 45%.</p>
<p>The EBA will continue monitoring the activities of NBLs through its biennial Consumer Trends Report and may consider, depending on the findings and the need, initiating further ad hoc action to foster further protection of EU consumers.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>The EBA is mandated under Article 9 of its founding Regulation to, inter alia, collect, analyse, and report on consumer trends. To that end, the EBA publishes a biennial Consumer Trends Report, with several editions identifying indebtedness as one of the key issues that causes significant detriment to consumers in the EU, with the last edition indicating that NBLs and their CWA practices may play a significant role in contributing to this recurrent issue.</p>
<p>In order to gauge insight of the CWA practices applied by NBLs in respect to credit products falling under the Consumer Credit Directive and/or the Mortgage Credit Directive, the EBA carried out a fact finding exercise with National Competent Authorities that chose a sample of 125 NBLs from across the EU to include in the exercise, and using the reference period between 2020 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ittai Ben Zeev, TASE CEO, said today:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;TASE continues to show resilience and support the Israeli economy against the backdrop of the ongoing war. We continue to push forward with technological innovation, implementing advanced infrastructure and promoting collaborations in order to upgrade the market, remove barriers and enhance its global accessibility. Now more than ever we are resolved to continue developing the capital market, as part of our unwavering commitment to the Israeli economy, which is pivotal to our national strength.</p>
<p>As part of these efforts, we recently published, in cooperation with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, a call for public comments on the proposal to align the TASE trading week with the global standard; a strong positive response was received in favor of changing to a Monday-through-Friday trading week. We are confident that this strategic move that will make TASE more readily accessible for global investors and increase their involvement in the Israeli capital market, benefiting the Israeli economy in general and the local companies in particular. We are currently examining all the public comments received in order to reach the most fitting solution, both for international investors and for the Israeli capital market."</p>
<p><strong>Tel Aviv, August 7, 2024 -&nbsp;</strong>The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE:&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Trading volumes rose significantly in the first half of the year with growth in indices and solid issuance activity</strong></p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, in the midst of the war, the TA-125 index increased by 3.5%, compared to the 3.8% for the Dow Jones index and compared 14.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index. Equity price rises characterized most sectoral indices, with the TA-Retail index leading the list with a 13% increase, followed by the high-tech companies&rsquo; indices - TA-Technology and TA-Global Bluetech, with a 10% and 9% increase, respectively, compared to the concurrent 17% increase in the NASDAQ 100 index. The market cap of the equity market at the end of the first half of the year reached NIS 1,087 billion, a 3% increase over 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Trading volumes in the main trading channels increased significantly in the first half of the year compared to 2023.</strong></p>
<p>In the equity market, trading volumes were 8% higher than the average daily trading volume for all of 2023, and averaged NIS 2.1 billion a day.</p>
<p>The average daily trading volume of bonds reached NIS 4.5 billion in the first half of the year, 15% higher than the average daily trading volume in the year 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the increase in the trading volume of the government shekel bonds, which totaled NIS 2.3 billion, compared to an average of NIS 1.9 billion in the previous year. CPI-linked government bonds also showed stronger trading volumes, at an average daily volume of NIS 1 billion, 1% greater than the average daily trading volume in the full year 2023. The trading volume of corporate bonds averaged NIS 1.1 billion, 12% greater than the average daily trading volume in the previous year.</p>
<p>T-bills also recorded substantial trading volumes in the first half of the year, at a daily average of NIS 1.7 billion, 19% higher than the average daily trading volume in 2023.</p>
<p>Creations and redemptions of mutual funds reached an average daily volume of NIS 1.8 billion, 28% greater than the average daily volume in the year 2023. The market cap of the mutual funds at the end of the first half of the year reached NIS 375 billion, 14% greater than the market cap at the end of 2023, this as a result of acquisitions of mutual funds and the appreciation of the mutual funds&rsquo; assets on TASE.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, 3 companies completed an IPO on TASE, compared to only one company in 2023.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the ongoing war and the growing deficit, the Ministry of Finance continued to raise debt in the second quarter of the year. The total amount of debt raised by the Ministry of Finance in bond offerings in the first half of the year totaled NIS 124.4 billion, compared to NIS 76.7 billion in the second half of 2023. NIS 95.7 billion of said amount was raised on TASE.</p>
<p><strong>Continued implementation of the strategic plan - alignment with global standards and diversification of investment products</strong></p>
<p>TASE continues to implement the strategic plan, with significant emphasis on the enhancement of global activity, the alignment of standards and the removal of trading barriers in the interfaces with the international markets.</p>
<p>Further to a call for public comments, published by TASE in collaboration with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, regarding the proposed transition to trading on Fridays as well, in line with the global standard, TASE announces that the proposed move received a very positive response from local and international investors, with a majority supporting a transition to a Monday through Friday trading week. TASE is currently considering options for the implementation of this alignment that would optimally benefit the local capital market and the international investors.</p>
<p>TASE continues to work in cooperation with the various authorities and regulators. Thus, for example, in mid-July, the Ministerial Legislation Committee approved the Securitization Law, which will facilitate, for the first time in Israel, the execution of securitization transactions, in alignment with global practices. Once the legislation is passed by the Knesset, TASE hopes to implement it and open the market already in 2025. In addition, the Israel Securities Authority has recently approved the launch of new money market funds with fixed dates, offering the public access to predetermined yield, this alongside the existing money market funds, allowing for greater product diversity for the benefit of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TASE continues to actively encourage new brokers to enter the Israeli capital market - since the end of May, Altshuler Shaham Trade is active as a member on TASE and TASE Clearing House, bringing the number of TASE members up to 25, compared to 24 at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>In addition, TASE continues to expand and diversify the range of products and to invest, among others, in new exclusive indices, this as part of its strategy of developing and upgrading the market, especially with the public in mind. In June, for the first time, TASE launched new indices with Kesem, Israel&rsquo;s largest fund company. In mid-July, TASE announced the launch of 7 additional equity and bond indices, some of which are designated for further collaborations between TASE and the various product issuers.</p>
<p>In the derivatives market, at the beginning of June, TASE reduced the multipliers of options on the TA-35 index, the TA-Banks5 index and the TA-125 index, as well as those of the foreign exchange derivatives traded on TASE. Part of the sources that will derive from the reduction of the underlying assets&rsquo; multipliers will be allocated to the development of the market and the enhancement of liquidity in the derivatives&rsquo; market by way of a volume rebate program.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights of the results for the second quarter and the first half of 2024:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revenue in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 105.1 million, compared to revenue of NIS 92.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 13%. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees. The most significant revenue item - trading and clearing commissions - totaled NIS 38.8 million in the second quarter of the year, compared to NIS 35.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year. 15% of the increase in revenue from trading and clearing commissions is due to an increase in the trading volumes and in the volume of creations/redemptions of mutual fund units. In opposition, a reduction in the effective commission rate in revenue from mutual funds and T-bills reduced the aforesaid increase in revenue by 4%, and there being one less trading day in the current quarter reduced revenue by an additional 2%.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 74.8 million, compared to costs of NIS 72.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 3% increase. The higher costs are due mainly to the increase in payroll expenses and technological investments and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 2 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 3.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 45% decrease. Financing income in the quarter increased due to interest income on the deposits. At the same time, financing expenses also increased as a result of a bank loan obtained at the end of 2023, resulting in reduced net financing income.</p>
<p><strong>Tax expenses, net in the second quarter of 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 8 million, compared to NIS 5.2 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The increase in the tax expense stemmed from the higher pre-tax profit. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to losses on securities in previous years for which deferred taxes were not created.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 24.3 million, compared to NIS 18.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%. The increase in profit was due mainly to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 45.8 million, compared to NIS 35.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%. Most of the increase is due to the NIS 10 million increase in profit before financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 25.7 million, compared to NIS 20.4 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 26%. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights of the results for the first half of 2024:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revenue in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 213.4 million, compared to revenue of NIS 192.9 million in the corresponding period last year, an 11% increase. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 150.1 million, compared to costs of NIS 142.6 million in the corresponding period last year, a 5% increase. The higher costs are due mainly to the increase in payroll expenses and technological investments and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 3.4 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 6.1 million in the corresponding period last year, a 44% decrease. Financing income in the period increased due to interest income on the deposits. At the same time, financing expenses also increased as a result of a bank loan obtained at the end of 2023, resulting in reduced net financing income.</p>
<p><strong>Net tax expense in the first half of 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 16.7 million, compared to NIS 12.2 million in the corresponding period last year, a 37% increase. The increase in the tax expense stemmed from the higher pre-tax profit. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to losses on securities in previous years for which deferred taxes were not created.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 50 million, compared to NIS 44.3 million in the corresponding period last year, a 13% increase. Most of the increase in profit was due to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 94.4 million, compared to NIS 79.1 million in the corresponding period last year, a 19% increase. The increase is due to an increase of NIS 12.9 million in profit before financing, eliminating share-based payment expenses and depreciation expenses in an amount of NIS 2.4 million.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 53.5 million, compared to NIS 46.5 million in the corresponding period last year, a 15% increase. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses and the adjustment of the increase in costs with respect to share-based payments.</p>

<title>ESAs’ Joint Board Of Appeal Dismisses Appeal By Euroins Insurance Group AD Against The European Insurance And Occupational Pensions Authority</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> unanimously, inadmissible, appeal, investigation, decision
Summary: The Board unanimously found Euroins' appeal inadmissible, stating that EIOPA's power to investigate is discretionary and not subject to review. The publication of the decision was postponed. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="node__content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Joint Board of Appeal (&ldquo;The Board&rdquo;) of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the EBA, ESMA, EIOPA), unanimously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-08/BoA_-_Euroins_v_EIOPA_-_combined_decision_and_orders.pdf">decided&nbsp;</a>that the appeal brought by Euroins Insurance Group AD (&ldquo;Euroins&rdquo;) against the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is inadmissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The appeal was brought in relation to the EIOPA Chairperson&rsquo;s decision not to start an investigation into an alleged breach or non-application of Union law regarding the withdrawal of the license of a subsidiary insurance undertaking of Euroins by the national competent authority in Romania.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its decision, the Board finds that EIOPA&rsquo;s power to initiate an investigation is of an entirely discretionary nature. Furthermore, the Board also asserts that the EIOPA Chairperson&rsquo;s decision to initiate an investigation is not subject to the Board&rsquo;s review. Finally, the decision clarifies that the Board does not have the power to order EIOPA to re-assess an appellant&rsquo;s request to open an investigation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Following the adoption of the decision, two orders on its publication were also adopted. The first order dismissed Euroins&rsquo; request not to publish the decision and its request for redaction. Yet, it agreed to delay publication to a date allowing Euroins to file an appeal against that order the General Court. The second order came upon request from the President of the Court of First Instance, seeking to grant additional time to analyse the case and consider interim measures requested by Euroins. That second order postponed the publication of the decision until 7 August 2024.</p>

<div> MoU, supervision, financial market infrastructure, coordination, regulatory sandboxes
Summary:
The Bank of England and FCA co-operate to supervise financial market infrastructure, with an effective MoU and plans for updates and new areas of coordination. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<h4>Statement</h4>
<div class="content-block">
<div class="page-content page-carousel sc-undefined" id="content">
<div id="output">
<p>The Bank of England (Bank) co-operates with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (&lsquo;The Authorities&rsquo;), to supervise financial market infrastructure (FMI).</p>
<p>A memorandum of understanding (MoU)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/august/boe-and-fca-mou-on-supervision-of-financial-market-infrastructures#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;facilitates effective supervision and policy making by the authorities. The MoU allows for the exchange of information between the authorities and promotes efficiency by minimising duplication of regulatory activities regarding FMIs. The MoU must be reviewed annually<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/august/boe-and-fca-mou-on-supervision-of-financial-market-infrastructures#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;to ensure it is proving effective. This involves requesting feedback from supervised FMIs on whether the proposed co-operation is working effectively.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA held a consultation with FMIs: Central Counterparties (CCPs), Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) and Recognised Central Securities Depositories (RCSDs) based on these firms&rsquo; interaction in 2023.</p>
<p>Respondents agreed that the arrangements of the MoU are proving to be effective and emphasised the importance of close and effective coordination between the authorities. They acknowledged the efforts made on coordination and agree that the Bank and FCA remain committed to effective co-operation. One noted feedback submitted last year had been acted upon. Respondents also highlighted increased communication and coordination between the respective supervisory teams relating to topics such as operational resilience.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA agree that the arrangements of the MoU regarding co-operation continue to be effective with appropriate coordination and no material duplication between them. The Bank and FCA will seek to address any specific areas identified by firms, including the need for collaboration in relation to new rulemaking powers.</p>
<p>The MoU will be updated in 2024 to reflect changes related to the Financial Services Markets Act (2023), as well as new areas requiring coordination, including regulatory sandboxes, in which innovations can be safely tested, and policy initiatives.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA are also agreeing a separate MoU setting out how they intend to co-operate with each other in relation to the operation and supervision of the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS). This DSS MoU will be published before supervision in the DSS commences.</p>

<div> Options, VIX futures, Cboe, trading, volatility
<br />
Cboe plans to launch options on VIX futures, addressing global demand for hedging tools. Options will complement existing VIX Index options. Users can hedge positions using front-month VIX futures and standard VIX Index options.
<br /><br />Summary: Cboe announced plans to launch options on VIX futures, expanding its VIX complex to address global demand for hedging tools. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>New options planned to be listed on front-month Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures</li>
<li>Options-on-future structure designed to offer new way to manage market volatility</li>
<li>Expansion of VIX complex aims to address global demand for hedging tools</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch options on Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures. The new options on VIX futures (VX) are expected to begin trading on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) on October 14, subject to regulatory review.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Cboe currently offers securities-based VIX Index options, which allow investors to manage or gain exposure to broad U.S. equity market volatility. &nbsp;The new options on VIX futures will provide similar utility but are based on front-month VIX futures. &nbsp;With futures as the underlying asset, these options will be CFTC-regulated, enabling a wide array of market participants that are restricted from accessing U.S. securities-based options to use this product to express their views on equity market volatility.</p>
<p>"As the pioneer in volatility trading, Cboe continues to expand its VIX complex with additional products and services targeted at helping market participants better manage portfolio risk and trade volatility," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Given the increased trading activity we're seeing in VIX options and the strong demand for hedging tools this year, we're especially excited to expand our volatility toolkit to include these new options on VIX futures and our planned relaunch of variance futures coming in late September. With the U.S. election quickly approaching, which has historically been a meaningful volatility catalyst for markets, we expect these tools will help meet customer demand to effectively manage risk."</p>
<p>"We expect options on VIX futures will complement our existing product suite, appealing to a broad group of users, including Commodity Trading Advisors, customers of Futures Commission Merchants, and market participants currently active in VIX exchange-traded products and in Cboe's SPX option and VIX product ecosystems," said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe. "By listing these options on Cboe's U.S. futures exchange, CFE's global network of FCMs and brokers can trade them using the same connections and memberships already established for trading VIX futures, thereby enhancing ease and accessibility."</p>
<p>Options on VIX futures will be European-style (can only be exercised at expiration) and will physically settle into front-month VIX futures. The new options are expected to complement the existing VIX Index options, providing customers with more choice in expiration dates and enabling more granular hedging strategies. Users of options on VIX futures may be able to hedge those positions using front-month VIX futures and standard VIX Index options.</p>
<p>The new options on VIX futures will be exclusively listed and traded on CFE, joining other prominent volatility products, such as Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures and the planned launches of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures and Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX) futures, subject to regulatory review.

<title>DTCC’s Insurance &amp; Retirement Services Launch Standardized “Can-Sell” API Messaging Application - Producer Authorization Provides NSCC Members The Capability To Confirm The Credentials Of Producers Instantaneously By Moving Straight From Distributor To Carrier</title>

<div> DTCC, Insurance & Retirement Services, Producer Authorization, real-time, standardized<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches PAR service, verifying producers' authorization in real-time, streamlining processes, leveraging ACORD NGDS, offering increased standardization. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of DTCC&rsquo;s Insurance &amp; Retirement Services&rsquo; (I&amp;RS) Producer Authorization (PAR) service, a standardized method for insurance vendors and distributors to communicate with carriers to verify producers' authorization that is mandatory to sell insurance products. PAR deploys synchronous messages, allowing distributors and vendors to ping carriers instantly to certify producer credentials, streamlining processes and increasing operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>Today, financial advisors are required by regulation to be properly licensed, appointed and trained to solicit and sell insurance products. PAR helps to standardize and automate this process by enabling distributors to properly validate producers&rsquo; credentials and qualifications in real time in order to understand whether individuals are permissioned to sell certain products in specific jurisdictions. This eliminates the need for firms to adopt and manage multiple proprietary processes and provides producers with the ability to proactively take corrective actions and lower Not in Good Order application submissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an industry need for a unified service, that provides real-time producer data, and we are pleased to now offer PAR,&rdquo; said Justin Schwartz, Executive Director, Product Management for Wealth Management Services at DTCC. &ldquo;In the development of the offering, we focused on building out a standardized &lsquo;can sell&rsquo; API message platform that improves client and advisor experience by providing increased confidence in authorized producers. We look forward to continuing to enhance our services to best meet the evolving needs of our clients and the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PAR leverages the ACORD Next-Generation Digital Standards (NGDS) UC-251 &ldquo;Verify Producer Can Sell Annuities&rdquo; User Story, providing enhanced licensing, appointments and training credentials that permits distributors to submit carrier message requests while simultaneously allowing carriers to determine if producers are authorized to advance new business applications. PAR can be utilized at any point during the solicitation/sales process, and the message statuses are readily available via API.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a need for a new insurance industry standard around real-time authorizations. This innovative solution has facilitated increased standardization in our messaging capabilities by streamlining processes which allows us to confirm a producers&rsquo; ability to sell a product for multiple carriers by accessing a single data point. We are excited to offer this service to our partners,&rdquo; said Doug Massey, EVP Sales at Hexure.</p>

<br />
H2O breached FCA regulations, failed due diligence on high-risk investments, did not declare conflicts of interest, provided false information, pays €250 million to affected investors.
<br /><br />Summary: H2O failed to comply with FCA regulations, resulting in a €250 million payment to affected investors. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Asset manager H2O AM LLP (H2O) will pay &euro;250 million to investors unable to access their funds since 2020, following an investigation by the FCA.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>Between April 2015 and November 2019, H2O failed to carry out proper due diligence on investments relating to the Tennor Group of companies owned by Lars Windhorst, or other companies he introduced.</span></p>
<p><span>The investments were high risk and hard to sell.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA also found that H2O did not have adequate policies or procedures or exercise due skill and care in managing potential conflicts of interest. The FCA identified over 50 instances where hospitality had been received by H2O employees but was not properly declared, including the use of a superyacht and private jet.</span></p>
<p><span>H2O also provided false and misleading statements and documentation to the regulator, such as fabricated records and minutes of meetings.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA would have imposed a substantial fine on H2O for its serious breaches. However, the FCA has agreed the firm will make &euro;250 million available to all those whose investments remain trapped. A significant part of this sum has been made available by way of voluntary contribution from the H2O Group. H2O has waived its rights to fees and investments totalling &euro;320 million and will apply to cancel its UK authorisation by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'H2O&rsquo;s job was to manage its funds properly and protect investors. It failed to do this and, to make matters worse, it repeatedly provided misleading information to the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>'Through this settlement the FCA has secured money for affected investors and agreement that H2O will stop operating regulated business in the UK.'</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read the FCA's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/h2o-am-llp-2024.pdf" title="h2o-am-llp-2024.pdf">Final Notice for H2O AM LLP</a>.</li>
<li>The French financial services regulator the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) is the designated regulator in respect of the collective investments, which H2O managed on a cross-border basis pursuant to the UCITS Directive, and the FCA is the designated regulator of H2O.</li>
<li>Were it not for the payment of &euro;250 million to affected investors and the fact that the AMF has previously issued a penalty on H2O (currently subject to appeal) in relation to the same investments, the FCA would have issued H2O with a penalty.</li>
<li>The FCA investigation found that H2O breached Principle 2 (skill, care and diligence), Principle 3 (management and control) and Principle 11 (relations with regulators) of its principles for business.</li>

<div> upgrades, latencies, Europe, Asia, trading
<br />
Avelacom has upgraded its core network to reduce latencies between European and East Asian trading hubs, providing faster connectivity for algorithmic trading strategies.
<br /><br />Summary: Avelacom upgrades network to reduce latencies between Europe and Asia, supporting increased trading volumes with faster connectivity. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Avelacom&rsquo;s core network has recently undergone significant upgrades, optimizing its terrestrial path latencies by up to 8 milliseconds.</span> </li>
<li><span>This benefits key routes between Europe&rsquo;s hubs (London, Frankfurt, Dublin, Zurich) and major East Asian hubs (Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong).</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Avelacom has reduced network latencies between European markets and major East Asian cities Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.&nbsp;</span><span>For example, the latency for the London &lt;&gt; Shanghai route is now less than 125 milliseconds (round-trip delay), compared to the previous industry benchmark of approximately 133 milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span>These unmatched speeds were achieved through network upgrades that were completed using cutting-edge technologies on these long-distance and complex routes, which travel through multiple countries.</span></p>
<p><span>Europe to East Asia routes are growing in demand, driven by increased FX and crypto electronic trading volumes, as well as increased participation from institutional traders. London is the world&rsquo;s largest currency trading hub, while Tokyo hosts tier 1 crypto venues, is a global price discovery hub for digital assets, as well as being a top tier FX trading destination. The improvement in network infrastructure achieved by Avelacom&rsquo;s upgrades supports this growth in trading volumes by providing faster connectivity that is pivotal for algorithmic strategies dominating the market. Routes into and out of Seoul, Korea will be the next to be upgraded</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Aleksey Larichev, CEO of Avelacom</span></strong><span>, states: &ldquo;Fast is never done because we serve global banks and prop trading firms that deploy sophisticated market-making and arbitrage strategies. We&rsquo;ve built our reputation by introducing unique, proprietary, and fastest connectivity options, tailored for the financial industry. Constantly updating network latencies is a significant part of our overall business success&rdquo;.</span></p>

<title>SET Market  Report For July 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Federal Reserve, interest rate, market turbulence, Thai shares, economic recovery
<br /><br />Summary: The Federal Reserve kept interest rate unchanged, market turbulence caused sell-off, Thai shares saw slower foreign selling, Thai economic recovery gaining speed, TFEX trading volume declined. <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve (Fed) kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50 percent for the eighth consecutive meeting in July, as widely expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the US central bank will pivot in September&rsquo;s meeting. However, weak job reports in July, released after Fed&rsquo;s July meeting, led the market to perceive that September&rsquo;s potential rate cut could be a slow-footed response from the Fed. This triggered a global stock market sell-off led by Wall Street and Japan. Amid the market turbulence, investors are recommended to accumulate stocks with appropriate valuation and limited exposure to the potential impacts of recession. Signs of capital inflows to the regional stock market have emerged.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that foreign investors were still net sellers of Thai shares in July but at a slower pace as the Thai baht strengthened against the greenback throughout the month. The firmer baht was primarily driven by the overall appreciation of Asian currencies, led by the Japanese yen, and bolstered by rising global gold prices amid heightened geopolitical risks. Foreign investors' net buying of Thai bonds also strengthened the baht. The Thai economic recovery is gaining speed, underpinned by exports, tourism, and higher government spending. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)&rsquo;s tightened measures on short selling have effectively curbed such activities, encouraging more domestic investment and counterbalancing foreign investment trends. Moreover, the Thai government approved more attractive tax benefits for investment in Thai ESG funds including an increase in tax-deductible amount and a shorter lock-up period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for July</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2024, SET Index rose 1.5 percent from the previous month but fell 6.7 percent from the end of 2023 to close at 1,320.86 points. Investors are awaiting a clearer picture of the government&rsquo;s economic stimulus measures and assessing the impact of market confidence-boosting measures implemented in July 2024. </li>
<li>For the seven months to July, industry groups that outpaced SET Index were Technology, Agro &amp; Food Industry, Consumer Products and Services.</li>

<div> - ASIC, legislative instruments, consultation, feedback, record-keeping obligations
Summary:
ASIC proposes extension of 3 legislative instruments for 5 years, invites feedback on their effectiveness, and outlines background on the instruments. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>ASIC proposes to extend the operation of three legislative instruments for a further five years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Order [<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/current/F2014L01237">CO 14/923</a>]&nbsp;<em>Record-keeping obligations for Australian financial services licensees when giving personal advice</em>,</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/current/F2021L01128">ASIC Corporations and Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Reportable Situations) Instrument 2021/716</a></em>, and&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/current/F2021L01364"><em>ASIC Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Prescribed Commonwealth Legislation) Instrument 2021/801</em></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC has assessed that these instruments, which are due to expire in October 2024, are operating efficiently and effectively, and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.</p>
<p>In extending operation of the instruments, ASIC will convert [CO 14/923] to the legislative instrument format and consolidate the relief in ASIC Instruments 2021/716 and 2021/801 into one instrument.</p>
<p><em>A consultation paper was not issued for this consultation.</em></p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>ASIC invites feedback on our proposal, including whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>the instruments are operating effectively and efficiently, and/or</li>
<li>whether any amendments are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders should send their submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by 5pm on 4 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders may choose to remain anonymous or use an alias when providing feedback. However, ASIC will not be able to contact stakeholders to discuss their feedback if it was submitted it in this manner.</p>
<p>Please note stakeholder feedback will not be treated as confidential unless stakeholders specifically request that we treat whole or part of it (such as any personal or financial information) as confidential.</p>
<p>Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/dealing-with-asic/privacy/asic-privacy-policy-complete/" title="ASIC Privacy Policy - complete">ASIC&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>&nbsp;for more information about how we handle personal information, rights to seek access to and correct personal information, and the right to complain about breaches of privacy by ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>[<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/current/F2014L01237">CO 14/923</a>] modifies the Corporations Act to insert a new section 912G that imposes specific record-keeping requirements when AFS licensees or their representatives (including advice providers) give personal advice to retail clients.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01128/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/716</a>&nbsp;modifies the Corporations Act to exclude certain forms of non-compliance from being deemed &lsquo;significant&rsquo; breaches of core obligations, about which AFS licensees and credit licensees must lodge breach reports under the Corporations Act. The instrument also extends the period in which AFS licensees and credit licensees may report certain breaches that relate to an earlier reported breach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01364/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/801</a>&nbsp;modifies the law to specify the other Commonwealth legislation that is a core obligation for the purposes of the National Credit Act. Credit licensees must report significant breaches of core obligations under the National Credit Act.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators And Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Expect Crypto Trading Platforms To Prioritize Applications For Investment Dealer Registration And CIRO Membership</title>

<div> Securities, Crypto trading platforms, Investment dealers, CIRO membership, Canadian securities law
<br />
CTPs in Canada must comply with securities laws, aim for registration as investment dealers, and CIRO membership. Investors should exercise caution when investing in crypto assets.
<br /><br />Summary: CTPs in Canada must comply with securities laws, aim for registration as investment dealers, and CIRO membership. Investors should exercise caution when investing in crypto assets. <div>
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) are reminding crypto trading platforms (CTPs) to ensure their operations comply with Canadian securities laws by prioritizing their applications for registration as investment dealers and membership with CIRO.</p>
<p>On March 29, 2021, the CSA and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (now CIRO) published<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2021/03/5952456-_-CSA-IIROC-Notice-21-329.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Staff Notice 21-329&nbsp;<em>Guidance for Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms: Compliance with Regulatory Requirements</em></a>, providing guidance on the securities law requirements that apply to CTPs.</p>
<p>In Canada, CTPs that facilitate trading in either a) crypto assets that are securities and/or derivatives or b) instruments or contracts, based on crypto assets, that are securities or derivatives, are expected to register as investment dealers and become members of CIRO, the regulatory body intended to oversee this type of activity.</p>
<p>As outlined in the staff notice, the CSA contemplated an interim approach, which allowed CTPs to operate as restricted dealers in an appropriately regulated environment for a time-limited period while working toward obtaining CIRO membership. CSA members expected CTPs to actively and diligently seek registration as investment dealers and membership with CIRO by the end of the time-limited period, which was generally expected to be two years.</p>
<p>Given the time that has passed, CSA members expect CTPs to have carefully reviewed and understood the requirements to become investment dealers and CIRO members, and be actively engaged with CIRO on their applications. Moving forward, CSA members do not intend to continue with the interim approach for time-limited restricted dealer registration for CTPs as described in the staff notice.</p>
<p>CTPs that have been working actively and diligently with CSA members to complete their registration should contact the CSA member that is their principal regulator to discuss whether time-limited registration as a restricted dealer is appropriate for the CTP.</p>
<p><strong>Applying for CIRO membership</strong></p>
<p>CIRO is committed to ensuring an efficient and thorough process to review CTPs&rsquo; applications for membership with CIRO. Guidance on applying for CIRO membership is available on CIRO.ca under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/becoming-dealer-member" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Becoming a Dealer Member</a>&nbsp;section. CTPs are encouraged to complete a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/176/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Readiness Questionnaire</a>&nbsp;to self-assess if they have the necessary infrastructure and capital in place to apply for membership.</p>
<p>CTPs must submit a completed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/191/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Membership Application Form</a>&nbsp;and all supporting materials to apply for CIRO membership. All membership applications undergo an extensive review by CIRO staff. Once satisfied that the CTP can comply with CIRO By-laws and Rules, CIRO staff will forward their recommendation to CIRO&rsquo;s Board of Directors for decision.</p>
<p>CIRO staff work closely with firms applying for membership and encourage applicants to contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MemberIntake@ciro.ca">MemberIntake@ciro.ca</a>&nbsp;to arrange for a pre-filing discussion with the CIRO team dedicated to managing membership applications and transactions.</p>
<p>We encourage all CTPs to consult their legal counsel about Canadian securities law and CIRO rules, and to contact their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principal regulator</a>&nbsp;or CIRO staff with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Investors interested in crypto assets</strong></p>
<p>Investing in crypto assets can be high risk. Before choosing to buy or sell crypto assets, the CSA urges investors to consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of CTPs</a>&nbsp;that are authorized to do business with Canadians.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada&rsquo;s debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians&rsquo; trust in financial regulation and the people managing their investments. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.ciro.ca</a>.</p>
<p>For investor inquiries, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact your local securities regulator</a>.</p>

<title>ACER Confirms That The Danish Emergency Gas Supply Tariffs Comply With The EU Network Code</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> methodology, compliance, non-protected consumers, emergency supply services, cost allocation
Summary:<br />ACER finds Danish emergency supply tariffs compliant but lacking transparency. Ex-ante tariff doesn't consider supply risks; ex-post compensation adjusts for actual interruptions. Recommended more detailed information. <div>
<p>Today, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTBVUGAldXUEwLAgZVHVZfVwQdU10GUxoFA1ZVVgNWAFUGUwIdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;on the Danish non-transmission tariffs proposed by Energinet, Denmark&rsquo;s Transmission System Operator (TSO). These tariffs cover the costs of Denmark&rsquo;s emergency supply services, such as filling gas storage and providing emergency gas supply to non-protected consumers.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCBFIHU1QAUkxbUlAAHVYPBVQdUw5UVxoMB1VRDFAFUwVXBgYdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposed methodology</a>&nbsp;includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ex-ante tariff, calculated using a postage stamp reference price methodology (RPM), which distributes emergency service costs equally among all non-protected consumers.</li>
<li>An ex-post compensation, which adjusts cost allocation after gas is delivered based on the actual gas volumes received by each non-protected consumer during an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span></p>
<p>ACER evaluated the compliance of the proposed methodology with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>) and notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ex-ante postage stamp tariff does not consider the varying risks of supply interruption among different non-protected customers.</li>
<li>Non-protected consumers receive equal protection for the first 72 hours after emergency measures begin. After this period, the risk of gas supply interruptions may depend on the remaining gas volumes.</li>
<li>Designing a cost-reflective ex-ante tariff is highly challenging due to information confidentiality and the uncertainty of supply emergencies.</li>
<li>In the event of a supply emergency, the ex-post compensation increases cost reflectivity by adjusting the initial tariff to reflect the actual level of interruption for each non-protected customer.</li>
<li>The consultation document lacks sufficient information on the functioning of the ex-post compensation mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACER concludes that the proposed non-transmission tariffs comply with the NC TAR and recommends the Danish regulatory authority to ensure greater transparency by providing more detailed information on the ex-post compensation mechanism in their next decision.</p>

<p>Bitcoin rebounded today, joined by significant gains in other cryptocurrencies, as concerns over interest rates continued to fuel market volatility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin has bounced back today as we see the wider cryptocurrency market back in the green." said Arthur Firstov, Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo, a leading payment infrastructure provider in the digital token space. "Nevertheless, a mood of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has now engulfed the digital token space. The still nascent asset class is at the mercy of the gyrations of global financial markets. The actions of the US&rsquo;s Federal Reserve &ndash; and whether it has been behind the curve on rate cuts &ndash; remain front and centre in the minds of traders. Cryptocurrency markets are likely to remain highly volatile amid frenetic trading in the days to come.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Improves Despite Financial Performance Concerns</title>

<div> improved, farmer sentiment, concerns, financial performance, farmland values
Summary:<br /><br />The farmer sentiment improved in July, with concerns about high input costs and lower crop prices. However, financial performance declined, impacting farmland value expectations. <div>
<p>Three broad-based measures of farmer sentiment improved in July as the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=2170705440&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;index rose 8 points to 113, the Index of Current Conditions increased by 10 points to 100, and the Index of Future Expectations at 119 was 7 points higher than a month earlier. Despite declines in corn and soybean prices from mid-June to mid-July &mdash; Eastern Corn Belt cash prices fell 11% and 5%, respectively &mdash; farmer sentiment improved in July. Responses to the individual questions attribute this positive shift to fewer respondents reporting worsened conditions compared to a year ago and a decrease in those expecting negative future outcomes. This month's Ag Economy Barometer survey was conducted from&nbsp;July 15-19, 2024.</p>
<p>The July survey showed that high input costs remained the biggest concern for 34% of farmers. Additionally, the risk of lower crop and livestock prices continues to worry producers, with 29% citing it as a top concern, up from 25% in June. Reflecting the signals from the&nbsp;Federal Reserve&nbsp;that interest rates have peaked, only 17% of respondents cited rising interest rates as a top concern, down from 23% last month.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 4 points in July to 81, 6 points lower than in&nbsp;July 2023. The decline in financial performance expectations reflected farmers' worries about weakening commodity prices and high input costs following improvements in the May and June indices. Although production costs for principal crops, including corn and soybeans, have decreased year over year, output prices have also fallen, raising the possibility of a cost-price squeeze for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;crop producers.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about farms' financial performance, the Farm Capital Investment Index rose 6 points in July to 38, though it remains weak, at 7 points lower than in&nbsp;July 2023. This improvement was due to a slight decrease in the number of producers who believe it's a bad time to make large investments, which dropped from 80% in June to 75% in July.</p>
<p>"Declines in crop prices point to lower producer incomes this year, so the increase in optimism was somewhat puzzling,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=1415570011&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=360616614&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "Fewer producers citing rising interest rates as a primary concern for the upcoming year corresponds with the modest improvement in their perspectives on capital investments, but respondents continue to express hesitancy to make large investments."</p>
<p>July saw a small improvement in the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index, rising to 118 from 115 in June. This was driven by more respondents expecting stable farmland values over the next year. At the same time, the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped 6 points from June to 146, with fewer farmers expecting values to rise over the next five years and more anticipating they will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>As nationwide discussions begin for the 2025 crop year's farmland leases, the July survey revealed that nearly three-fourths (72%) of crop farmer respondents expect cash rental rates to remain roughly the same as in 2024. Among the remaining respondents, views were nearly evenly divided, with 15% anticipating a rise in rates and 13% expecting a decline.</p>

<div> ICE, Two Harbors, Encompass, digital mortgage platform, direct-to-consumer recapture originations channel
Summary:<br />ICE's Encompass platform selected by Two Harbors for direct-to-consumer mortgage originations, providing streamlined workflows and borrower experience, part of ICE's full mortgage technology ecosystem. <div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Intercontinental Exchange</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>, Inc.</span>&nbsp;</a>(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that Two Harbors Investment Corp.(NYSE:TWO) (&ldquo;Two Harbors&rdquo;), an MSR + Agency RMBS real estate investment trust, has selected the Encompass&nbsp;<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;digital mortgage platform to support their new direct-to-consumer recapture originations channel. Part of ICE&rsquo;s end-to-end digital housing finance ecosystem, Encompass is the mortgage industry&rsquo;s leading digital platform for lenders to originate, service, sell and purchase loans faster &ndash; all from a single system of record.</p>
<p>Since acquiring RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC (&ldquo;RoundPoint&rdquo;) in 2023, Two Harbors has become the eighth largest servicer of conventional loans in the country. The decision to expand into mortgage loan originations is key to their strategy of retaining servicing customers when interest rates drop and borrowers begin to refinance their loans. After a thorough search, Two Harbors identified Encompass as their platform partner in their effort to build out a direct-to-consumer channel to streamline origination workflows and provide an exceptional borrower experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The built-in configurability and smooth implementation process with ICE meant that we were able to begin offering loans to our customers at RoundPoint within several months of our decision to go with Encompass,&rdquo; said Bill Greenberg, Two Harbors&rsquo; President and CEO. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to continue to take advantage of the additional capabilities and greater efficiencies within the integrated ICE technology ecosystem. When we consider the scope of what we can achieve together, the possibilities are exciting and will be beneficial to our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encompass is key to the ICE end-to-end mortgage technology ecosystem, which is digitizing the entire real estate and housing finance lifecycle to create a better experience for lenders, homeowners, and investors. ICE is committed to investing in new innovations that help companies drive operational efficiencies across their entire business with visibility and control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud that Two Harbors chose the Encompass digital lending platform as they strategically expand their mortgage offerings.&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s technology will help them better meet the needs of borrowers in this continuously evolving market. Two Harbors has been able to quickly deliver for their customers &ndash; a testament to our ongoing commitment to innovation that both helps mortgage companies operate more efficiently and delivers a better experience to the American homeowner.&rdquo;</p>

<div> electronic marketplaces, trading volume, government bond, credit derivatives, repo<br />
<br />Summary:
Tradeweb reported a significant increase in trading volumes across various asset classes, including government bonds, credit derivatives, and repo in July 2024. <div>
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of July 2024 of $40.5 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-july-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$40.5-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.82-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $1.82tn, an increase of 43.5 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<p>In July 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share of fully electronic U.S. high yield TRACE</li>
<li>ADV in global repurchase agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2024 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<h5>RATES  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 47.4% YoY to $206.1 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 16.5% YoY to $42.9bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond volumes were supported by growth across all client sectors. Increased adoption across a range of protocols and favorable market conditions contributed to the increase in volume. The addition of r8fin continues to contribute positively to wholesale volumes. Strong double-digit YoY growth in European government bonds and UK Gilts was supported by sustained volatility on the back of key political elections in Europe and the UK earlier in July, as well as a continued active primary market during the first half of the month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 17.6% YoY to $196.8bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Record July To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was driven by robust roll trading activity and significant participation from fast-money accounts. Specified pool trading volumes were up YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 38.9% YoY to $351.5bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 85.7% YoY to $671.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong volume in swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was driven by ongoing institutional client activity, strong tailwinds from global political uncertainties and a 23% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Central banks continued to contribute to increased volatility due to active discussions on rate movements. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for risk transfers especially in inflation swaps and non-G3 currencies. Emerging markets swap growth remained strong. July compression activity was lower than 2Q24.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>CREDIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 38.3% YoY to $6.7bn and European credit ADV was up 10.5% YoY to $2.1bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.8% and a record 9.1% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. European credit volumes continued to be led by strong client adoption of portfolio trading as well as increased client adoption of Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;, Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) and our unique dealer selection tool (SNAP IOI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 21.6% YoY to $363 million (mm).  
<ul>
<li>Volume growth outpaced the broader market, which was up approximately 11% YoY<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-july-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$40.5-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.82-trillion/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>, as Tradeweb institutional and retail volumes surpassed 20% YoY growth amidst robust issuance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 44.0% YoY to $10.8bn.&nbsp;  
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>EQUITIES  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was down 1.7% YoY to $8.0bn and European ETF ADV was up 9.3% YoY to $2.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>ETF market volumes continued to be muted as market volatility remained low. On Tradeweb, U.S. ETF institutional volumes were strong, while wholesale volumes were lower YoY. European ETF volumes increased as clients continued to embrace our automated rules-based trading protocol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>MONEY MARKETS  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 25.3% YoY to $621.8bn.  
<ul>
<li>Increased client activity on Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic repo trading platform drove record global repo activity. The combination of quantitative tightening, increased collateral supply, and current rates market activity shifted more assets from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s reverse repo facility to money markets. Retail money markets activity was strong as markets priced in less aggressive Fed rate cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>*All comparisons versus 2Q23 unless otherwise noted.</i></p>
<p>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategy and delivered solid financial results and continued expense and capital discipline. Our strong free cash flow generation model gives us the flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to investors. We repurchased $50 million in shares year-to-date, and our Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $200 million.</p>
<p>The international roll-out of X-Pro and the launch of the next phase of our high-touch strategy is expected to occur late in the third quarter and will include initial elements of AI dealer select functionality. Our announcement yesterday to connect our liquidity pools with ICE Bonds to drive greater efficiency and liquidity in the Municipal and corporate bond markets is a great example of how we are leveraging connectivity to drive future growth.</p>
<p>In summary, we made significant progress in executing our strategy in the second quarter, and we believe the strategic priorities we have established will drive increased market share and higher levels of revenue growth for shareholders in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bwmarginl1"><b>Credit Commission Revenue</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Total credit commission revenue of&nbsp;<b>$160.8</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<b>$33.2</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;in fixed-distribution fees) increased&nbsp;<b>$6.8</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;, or&nbsp;<b>4%</b>&nbsp;, compared to&nbsp;<b>$154.0</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<b>$35.3 million</b>&nbsp;in fixed-distribution fees) in the prior year. The increase in total credit commission revenue was driven principally by higher emerging markets, U.S. high-grade and Eurobonds commission revenue. Strong growth in these products was partially offset by lower U.S. high-yield commission revenue on lower credit spread volatility. The decline in variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$148.16</b>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<b>$157.42</b>&nbsp;in the prior year was mainly due to product and protocol mix-shift, principally lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The decrease in fixed-distribution fees was principally driven by the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1"><b>Credit Trading Volumes</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Strong growth in total credit average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$13.7 billion</b>&nbsp;, up&nbsp;<b>12%</b>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<b>Record $55.0 billion&nbsp;</b>in&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>total portfolio trading volume, up&nbsp;<b>143%</b>&nbsp;compared to the prior year, and up&nbsp;<b>24%&nbsp;</b>from 1Q24.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><b>34%</b>&nbsp;Open Trading share&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of total credit trading volume, in line with the prior year. The Company delivered estimated&nbsp;<b>price improvement</b>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;via Open Trading of approximately&nbsp;<b>$110 million</b>&nbsp;in the quarter.</li>

We believe the decrease in U.S. high-yield estimated market share year-over-year was driven, in part, by&nbsp;<b>lower levels of credit spread volatility</b>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<b>greater focus on the new issue calendar</b>&nbsp;by our long-only client segment.

<p><b>Non-GAAP financial measures and other items</b></p>
<p>To supplement the Company&rsquo;s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;EBITDA&rdquo;), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company&rsquo;s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow.</p>
<p>Please refer to Tables 6 &amp; 7&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54104935&amp;newsitemid=20240805496841&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=3&amp;md5=4b97a1c3a45ecb76ff36d7ad40372915" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Due to variances in how portfolio trading market participants utilized the portfolio trading TRACE &ldquo;flag,&rdquo; the Company previously used its own internal methodology for calculating portfolio trading as an estimated percentage of TRACE volume and the Company&rsquo;s estimated market share. The Company is reviewing recent improvements in the TRACE data, but it now believes that the portfolio trading TRACE &ldquo;flag&rdquo; more accurately reflects the true size of the portfolio trading market. As such, at this time, the Company is not presenting portfolio trading as an estimated percentage of TRACE volume or the Company&rsquo;s portfolio trading estimated market share for the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, for periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54104935&amp;newsitemid=20240805496841&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=4&amp;md5=fdb98467f415a1036d1c3fbbabf6870f" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<title>Biotech IPO Raising Soars Sixfold QoQ in Q1 2024 Amid Renewed Investor Optimism, Reveals GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> IPOs, biotech, Q1 2024, GlobalData, investor optimism <br />
Summary:<br />
- IPOs in biotech surged in Q1 2024, indicating pent-up demand after a two-year decline. 
- Strong clinical data may encourage more biotech IPOs in late 2024.
- H1 2024 had six IPOs raising over $100 million each, renewing investor optimism. 
- Switzerland, the US, and India led in biotech IPO raises in 2024. 
- Updated rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange aim to boost London's position as a major financial hub. <div>
<p><span><span>Biotech initial public offerings (IPOs) surged in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, with eight completed IPOs raising $3.72 billion&mdash;six times the amount raised in Q4 2023 and marking the highest quarterly biotech IPO value in over a year on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) comparison. This increase followed a two-year decline, indicating pent-up demand. Going forward, robust clinical data may encourage more biotech companies to go public later in the year, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3D0nkm_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CIf5jHM7L0a7n2JNJKQ7GrH0rYmMXsallAnv-2FY6uIMOyda0I9tYCLLXtpZRvn2cCAnr7IMGWonNn0XH0-2FhcYm1-2FxsJkRM4Ylnias18noVNM5hIKw59THOL1ddjvVE52Y0ycKZFcz36lp9nqGIXeRmo3FVzXRiOILeRmhVvEy45968Usw8cJwPL5db8GohM9q5gxXK1Kiwt6Fjx9XNYsBCvh66YdD4-2FZ1m2n05DWPvTo0-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharmaceutical Intelligence Center, the surge in completed biotech IPO raising in Q1 2024 followed a two-year decline from $30.8 billion in 2020 to $5.9 billion in 2022 and $4.4 billion in 2023.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;High interest rates during 2022 and 2023 led investors to prioritize the existing portfolios over new opportunities, causing many biotechs to delay their IPOs until market conditions improved.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The increase in IPO value raised in Q1 2024 set a strong pace for the year, possibly reflecting the pent-up demand after a two-year slump. The first and largest biotech IPO to date was CG Oncology, raising $437 million for its armed oncolytic virus therapy, CG-0070.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan adds: &ldquo;Despite a decline in IPOs in Q2 2024, companies with strong clinical data that previously struggled to secure funding may now see early 2024 successes as an opportunity to pursue public offerings.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_.jpg" title="GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In H1 2024, six completed IPOs each raised over $100 million, totaling nearly $5 billion. This is more than double the $2.2 billion raised by five high-value IPOs in H1 2023. This surge, along with more venture funding, has renewed investor optimism. In 2024, biotech companies in Switzerland, the US and India led with the highest IPO raises, with $2.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $273 million, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority has recently updated the rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange. These changes are meant to make it easier for companies to go public and boost London&rsquo;s position as a major financial hub post-Brexit. The new rules aim to improve Britain&rsquo;s capital markets, attract more investment, and make London a strong competitor to financial hubs like New York and the EU.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;The growth in completed IPOs in the first half of 2024 marks a positive shift following a period of downturn. This reflects renewed investor optimism to create new opportunities for companies with strong clinical data. The success of IPOs in the first quarter may prompt more biotechs to go public in the latter half of the year, although investors remain cautious as market conditions stabilize.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Includes all completed IPO deals for companies headquartered globally from H1 2020&ndash;H1 2024. Includes deals where deal values are disclosed in the public domain.</span></span></span></p>

<div> director, promoter, manager, ban, breach <br />
Justice Robinson banned Wei Zhong and Regina Ding for 9 years for market manipulation and imposed penalties, emphasizing their lack of integrity and remorse. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Wei (Walker) Zhong and Lei (Regina) Ding have been banned from being a director, promoter or manager of an entity, as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct 2013 (FMC Act), for nine years, the High Court has ruled.</p>
<p>Mr Zhong was the Executive Chairman and CEO of Oceania Natural Limited; Ms Ding was a senior manager and marketing director of Oceania Natural Limited.</p>
<p>The pair were found to have breached the market manipulation and disclosure provisions under the FMC Act in April 2023. They received the highest penalties imposed to date for breaching the market manipulation provisions. Mr Zhong received a penalty of $1.3m and Ms Ding was ordered to pay $760,000.</p>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; sought banning orders for both Mr Zhong and Ms Ding and costs as part of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Justice Robinson awarded the FMA costs of approximately $468,000.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, welcomed the decision. She said: &ldquo;Banning orders are designed to protect the public from harm and hold egregious conduct, as was displayed in this case, to account. Senior managers of listed companies have a responsibility to act with integrity and trust, Mr Zhong and Ms Ding&rsquo;s conduct fell well short of what was expected of them. As Justice Robinson stated, Mr Zhong and Ms Ding&rsquo;s misconduct was flagrant and dishonest, and they showed a complete lack of remorse and contrition.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Joint Guidance To Help Certain Large Banks Further Develop Their Resolution Plans</title>

<div> guidance, resolution plans, banks, Federal Reserve, submission deadline
Summary:
The Federal Reserve issued final guidance for certain large banks' resolution plans, setting a new submission deadline of October 1, 2025. The guidance addresses key areas of vulnerability and provides expectations for different resolution strategies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Monday issued final joint guidance to help certain large banks further develop their resolution plans. The final guidance is largely similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230829b.htm">proposed guidance</a>&nbsp;from August 2023 and incorporates changes in response to comments received. The Board developed the guidance jointly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and it is now final following both agencies' approval.</p>
<p>These resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure.</p>
<p>The guidance generally applies to domestic and foreign banks with more than $250 billion in total assets but that are not the largest and most complex banks, for which guidance is already in place. The guidance addresses the specific characteristics of, and risks posed by, this group of banks.</p>
<p>The guidance is organized around key areas of potential vulnerability, such as capital, liquidity, and operational capabilities that could be needed in resolution. Distinct from the guidance to the largest and most complex banks, this guidance provides agency expectations for both single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, which are different strategies banks have adopted for their rapid and orderly resolution. It also recognizes that the preferred resolution outcome for foreign banks is often a successful home country-led resolution and guides foreign banks on how to address the global resolution plan in their U.S. plan.</p>
<p>The agencies also announced that they are extending the resolution plan submission deadline for the banks to which the guidance applies. Banks will be required to submit their resolution plans by October 1, 2025, instead of March 31, 2025. The purpose of the extension is to provide reasonable time for banks to consider the final guidance as they develop their plan submissions.</p>

<div> London, Thomas Ellis, Hakluyt, managing partner, global strategic advisory<br />
Summary:<br />
Thomas Ellis elected as managing partner at Hakluyt, with prior experience in the EMEA region and banking. Committed to leading the firm's future success. <div>
<p>Hakluyt, the global strategic advisory firm for businesses and investors, is delighted to announce that Thomas Ellis has been elected the firm's new managing partner.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg799bleft"><img align="middle" alt="Hakluyt announces election of Thomas Ellis as new managing partner" id="prnejpg799bleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2475585/Hakluyt_New_Managing_Partner.jpg" title="Hakluyt announces election of Thomas Ellis as new managing partner" /></div>
<p>Currently based in London, Tom joined Hakluyt eight years ago, and has served as the company's chief operating officer for the past two years. He previously led Hakluyt's client-facing business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, and before that ran the firm's office in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Prior to Hakluyt, he worked at Lloyds Banking Group, including as director of business banking, and as a civil servant in the UK Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>Lord Paul Deighton, Hakluyt's chairman, said: "Tom has been elected managing partner with strong support from across the Hakluyt partnership &ndash; so he has a clear mandate for his vision for the firm and plans for the future. I, along with the rest of the board, congratulate him and look forward to giving him our full support as Hakluyt enters its 30th year and continues to go from strength to strength.</p>
<p>"I should also like to record my thanks to Holly Morrow for doing an excellent job as acting managing partner since the departure last month of our previous managing partner, Varun Chandra, for a role in the UK government."</p>
<p>Tom added: "I am honoured to have been elected by my peers to lead Hakluyt as its new managing partner. After eight brilliant years with the firm, it is a privilege to have this opportunity to build on the excellent work of my predecessors and colleagues, and lead us into our next chapter.</p>
<p>"As the operating environment for business leaders around the world becomes ever more complex, demand for Hakluyt's advice and expertise continues to grow in all regions. It is my overriding goal to ensure that we continue to be as well placed as possible to help our clients succeed."</p>

Summary:<br />Online brokerages Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments experienced outages as investors offloaded risky assets amid recession fears, while Wall Street plummeted due to weak economic data. Robinhood Markets also resumed trading after a pause. <div>
<p>On Monday, online services at brokerages Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments experienced significant outages as many investors sought to offload risky assets amid fears of a potential U.S. recession.</p>
<p>Users reported difficulties logging into their accounts, a problem that the trading apps confirmed without further details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Charles Schwab site, a warning notice said, "Due to a technical issue, some clients may have difficulty logging in to Schwab platforms and may have difficulty reaching us by phone. Please accept our apologies as our teams work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Wall Street's main indexes plummeted, driven by weak economic data, disappointing second-quarter earnings from major technology firms, and rising geopolitical tensions, which reignited recession concerns and dampened hopes for a soft landing.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Robinhood Markets, a popular platform among retail investors, stated it had resumed overnight trading after a temporary pause.</p>

Global securities finance industry revenue decreased 11% from July 2023. U.S. equity lending revenue fell 20%, while Taiwanese securities revenue increased 59%. Sovereign debt revenue improved 8%. Corporate bonds revenue fell 23%. Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., ImmunityBio Inc., and NuScale Power Co. were the top revenue-earning securities. <br /><br />Summary: <br />Global securities finance industry revenue decreased 11%. U.S. equity lending fell 20%, while Taiwanese securities revenue increased 59%. Sovereign debt revenue improved 8%, but corporate bonds revenue fell 23%. The top revenue-earning securities were Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., ImmunityBio Inc., and NuScale Power Co. <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $843 million in revenue for lenders in July 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents an 11% decrease from the $943 million generated in July 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $219 million in revenue in July, down 7% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Amid a continued bull market, U.S. equity lending revenue remained the most significant laggard, falling 20% year-over-year. Decreased fees were the driver, with the average cost to borrow for U.S. stocks declining 21% from July 2023. However, with fees bouncing in July, U.S. equities showed positive momentum with a 22% revenue increase month-over-month.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the global equity lending market, Taiwanese securities continued to generate strong returns with revenue increasing 59% year-over-year. Loan balances for Taiwan equities climbed a sharp 43% while fees also increase 11% compared to 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In fixed income, global lending revenue for corporate bonds continued to cool, falling 23% year-on-year. The dip was driven by investment-grade issuances, where a 28% drop in fees led to a 21% decline in revenue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global sovereign debt revenue improved 8% year-on-year as balances climbed 15%. U.S. Treasury lending accounted for the bulk of the improvement, with revenue rising 14%.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in July were</span><span>&nbsp;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI US), Lucid Group Inc.</span><span>&nbsp;(LCID US),&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US),&nbsp;</span><span>ImmunityBio Inc. (IBRX US)</span><span>&nbsp;and NuScale Power Co. (SMR US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $87 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: As Tappable Equity Hits Record High Of $11.5T, 3 Of 5 Mortgage Holders Have At Least $100K To Borrow Against</title>

<div> Equity, Mortgage debt, Tappable equity, Leverage ratio, Underwater mortgages
Summary:<br /><br />Outstanding mortgage debt at all-time high of $13.8T, but home prices drive equity to record $17.6T. Tappable equity hits $11.5T. Underwater mortgages at 0.60%. Texas, Florida, and Louisiana worth watching.<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Even as outstanding mortgage debt hit an all-time high of $13.8T in June, rising home prices outpaced that growth, driving mortgage holder equity to its own new record high of $17.6T in Q2 2024</li>
<li>Climbing equity has eased overall leverage in the market, with total mortgage debt equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, down from 44.6% in Q1 and the third lowest leverage ratio of the past 20+ years</li>
<li>Tappable equity &ndash; the amount a borrower can access while maintaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; also hit a new peak in June at $11.5T, a +4% gain from Q1 and +9.2% year over year</li>
<li>32M mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and nearly 1.2M have $1M or more, with higher equity holders tending to have lower first lien rates as well</li>
<li>Borrowers with 760+ credit scores hold two-thirds of tappable equity; a similar share is held by those with sub-4% first lien rates, an inherent incentive to use second lien debt to tap equity, should the need arise</li>
<li>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater nationwide, representing just 0.60% of active mortgages, with another 4.2% having less than 10% equity in their homes</li>
<li>Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas, increasing the number of borrowers in negative equity positions</li>
<li>Nationally, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in markets where prices have pulled back from recent highs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its August 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>Though the ICE Home Price Index (HPI) has shown a general slowdown in the rate of home price growth through June &ndash; and in some locales, price declines driven by surplus inventory &ndash; mortgage holders&rsquo; equity levels continue to hit new heights. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, there is more outstanding mortgage debt today than at any point in history, but at the same time, overall market leverage remains near all-time lows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outstanding mortgage debt, including both first and second liens, hit an all-time high in June, but growth in home prices has outpaced that gradual rise in debt,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Total cumulative debt leverage &ndash; essentially a loan-to-value ratio for the entire mortgage market &ndash; is equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, the third lowest leverage ratio we&rsquo;ve seen in the past 20-plus years. Rising home prices have also continued to build the fortunes of existing homeowners, pushing tappable equity &ndash; the amount a mortgage holder can leverage while retaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; to its highest level ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine out of ten of mortgage holders (48.5M) have some degree of tappable equity. A fair representation of the addressable market for second lien lending, tappable equity continues to be held primarily by higher credit score borrowers with low first lien interest rates. Two-thirds of such equity is held by mortgage holders with credit scores of 760 or higher, with a similar share held by those with first lien rates below 4%.</p>
<p>Three out of five (32M) mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and 1.2M have $1M or more. Higher equity levels tend to correspond with lower first lien interest rates, as those borrowers, on average, were able to capitalize on record low interest rates while also buying into the market earlier at lower prices. The average first lien rate of borrowers without tappable equity is approximately 5.5%, nearly a full percentage point above those with up to $50K available to borrow against (4.45%). Borrowers with $50-$199K to borrow against have average first lien rates of just above 4%, while those with $500K or more to borrow against have average rates of around 3.75%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home equity lending has been sluggish since interest rates began their climb higher early in 2022,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;As the Fed raised short-term lending rates, accessing equity became more expensive for homeowners, evidenced by the anemic growth in such lending despite record levels of available, tappable equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Industry expectations that the Fed will soon begin easing short-term rates could gradually change that dynamic, given the more direct impact short term rates have on home equity rate offerings, and lenders would do well to prepare. The ability to originate and service home equity loans alongside first lien mortgages will be key &ndash; to say nothing of using data-driven portfolio analysis to identify potential second lien customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater on their mortgages nationwide, putting just 0.60% of active loans in a negative equity position, with another 4.2% holding less than 10% equity in their homes. That said, Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas.</p>
<p>In Austin, for example, home prices are more than 15% off 2022 peaks, resulting in some 2.6% of mortgage holders owing more than their homes are currently worth. Similarly, in San Antonio, 2.7% of homes are underwater. Negative equity rates are also rising in Florida, as Cape Coral, Lakeland, North Port and Jacksonville &ndash; where inventories have surged and home prices are softening &ndash; have all seen an increase in negative equity. The same is true of New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana. Nationwide, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in areas like San Antonio, Austin, Cape Coral and North Port, where prices have pulled back from recent highs.</p>

<title>Save The Date! ACER Workshop: Designing Electricity Network Tariffs To Fit The Energy Transition (30 September 2024)</title>

<div> workshop, tariffs, ACER, network, electricity<br />
Summary: 
ACER organizes a workshop on electricity tariffs, discussing dilemmas, solutions, and best practices, and collecting stakeholders' views. <div>
<p>Achieving the EU's climate and energy goals requires significant investment in new network capacities, which increases pressure on network tariffs. Meanwhile, the ongoing electrification and changing grid usage patterns challenge existing tariff designs.</p>
<p>In a decentralised and digitalised energy landscape, these challenges also present opportunities (such as more flexible users and increased automation). Cost-reflective and transparent tariffs can encourage efficient network connection and usage, reducing costs for users.</p>
<p>Setting tariffs is complex, with no &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; design, as regulators need to balance different principles and national specifics. Regulators and stakeholders can benefit from discussing challenges and sharing effective tariff solutions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the event about?</span></p>
<p>Every two years,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECAFSBFFUBUwNVAxSHVYKBgMdUFwHVhpRUVcDAwsNUw8AVFMdUFFVAgkFVlsdVg8NVR0GXwBXGgwHAAYZClZWUlMOBgBTUFoHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER reviews</a>&nbsp;national tariff practices and reports on methodologies and the most effective approaches.</p>
<p>Ahead of ACER&rsquo;s next electricity tariff report (early 2025), ACER organises a workshop to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the most pressing transmission and distribution tariff dilemmas;</li>
<li>debate potential solutions and best practices to address them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save the date &amp; get involved!</span></p>

<div> July, small business, consumer spending, retail, restaurant
Summary:<br />Small business sales rose 3.5% year-over-year and 1.3% month-over-month, with strong retail growth and declining restaurant sales. Utilities and hospitals were the fastest growing categories. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index rises to 141</i> </li>
<li><i>Small business sales grew 3.5% year-over-year, and 1.3% month-over-month</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade; for July 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and nature of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fiserv Small Business Index provides timely and granular insight into consumer spending at small businesses, which is often a bellwether for the broader economy,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;Following modest declines in June, consumer spending rebounded nicely in July to help many small businesses start the second half of the year strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for July rose to 141. This jump in consumer spending followed a four-point decline in June. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+3.5%) and transactions (+3.3%) grew compared to July 2023. Month-over-month small business sales grew (+1.3%) despite transactions slightly declining (-0.7%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending patterns continue to shift, most notably with Retail spend experiencing a decisive bounce back compared to June,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Specialty trade and professional services also performed very well due to seasonal demand and stabilizing inflation rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Retail</span></p>
<p>July saw strong retail spending growth as the national Retail index rose by four points to 146. Year-over-year retail sales (+4.6%) and transactions (+5.8%) increased and all retail subsectors showed growth compared to June. General Merchandise (+10.9%) led retail in yearly growth, followed by Health and Personal Care (+8.6%), Building Equipment and Garden Materials (+6.2%), Food and Beverage Retailers (+4.9) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.7%).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, retail sales (+2.5%) and transactions (+0.1%) grew as higher average ticket sizes drove short-term spending, even though foot traffic remained relatively flat. Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers (+4.8%) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.8%) led growth compared to June, followed by General Merchandise (+3.5%) and Health and Personal Care (+3.1%).</p>
<p><span>Restaurant</span></p>
<p>Food Services and Drinking<span>&nbsp;</span>Places<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 123 for July, a 4-point decline from June. On an annual basis, restaurant sales declined (-1.6%) despite seeing modest growth in foot traffic (+0.7%). Consumers dining out have also seen a significant decrease in average ticket size (-2.4%) compared to July 2023.</p>
<p>Month-over-month restaurant sales (-3.1%) and transactions (-1.4%) both decreased compared to June 2024, marking a second consecutive month of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Similar to the yearly trend, average ticket sizes also declined (-1.7%) on a monthly basis &ndash; indicating that consumers may be feeling some pricing relief when dining out.</p>
<p><span>Other Industry Movers</span></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services continue seeing significant growth in sales (+15.2%) and transactions (+13.9%) year-over-year. Month-over-month performance was strong as well with both total sales and transactions growing (+3.6%) compared to June. Gains in this industry were across a broad range of services, some of which saw increased demand following harsh weather events in June.</li>
<li>Specialty Trade Contractors grew sales (+5.7%) and transactions (+2.5%) year-over-year. Month-over-month sales (+3.0%) also rose despite total transactions (+0.1%) holding steady. Demand for air conditioning and related services drove most of the spending increase, along with broader demand for general construction and carpentry.</li>
<li>Additional year-over-year growth categories included Web Search, Libraries and Information Services (+20.4%), Amusement/Gambling/Recreation (+8.3%) and Food Manufacturing (+8.1%); the sharpest annual declines were in Real Estate (-12.3%) and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing (-10.5%).</li>
<li>Utilities (+6.2%) and Hospitals (+5.7%) were the fastest growing small business categories on a monthly basis; Performing Arts, Spectator Sports and Related Industries (-2.4%), Accommodation (-1.2%) and Insurance (-0.1%) each saw modest month-over-month declines.</li>

The total rates ADV was $22.3 billion, up 32.0% versus the prior year.  <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for July 2024.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;In July, we delivered 12% growth in total credit ADV, driven by an 18% increase in U.S. high-grade, an 18% increase in Eurobonds, a 7% increase in emerging markets and a 65% increase in Municipal bonds on record estimated market share. We also generated record portfolio trading ADV of $972 million. These strong results helped offset a decline in U.S. high-yield ADV. We are not pleased with the progression of U.S. credit market share in July, but we are encouraged by the prospect for potential increases in market volatility in the coming months. We believe that our strategy, including the expansion of our portfolio trading offering and dealer solutions, through the roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro to our global client base, will drive future market share expansion in U.S. credit.&rdquo;</p>

<div> mortgage broker, FCA, order, vulnerable consumers, unauthorised

Summary:
FCA secures £4m order against unauthorised mortgage broker and associates for exploiting vulnerable consumers. Judgment finds serious breaches by LPI and NPI. Trapped individuals with deceptive practices. Enforcement action taken. An order for recovery of funds issued.  <div>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has secured an order of &pound;4m against an unauthorised mortgage broker and its associates who exploited vulnerable consumers.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>London Property Investments (U.K) Limited (LPI) arranged mortgages while NPI Holdings Limited (NPI) bought properties and rented them back to the sellers, both without FCA authorisation. Daniel Stevens, the director of LPI and NPI, and his father, Tony Stevens, were also found liable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt described these breaches as &lsquo;serious contraventions, conducted over an extended period, involving high levels of culpability including deception of the consumers and the lenders, and which took advantage of the consumers&rsquo; vulnerability&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4 defendants are ordered to pay around &pound;4 million to the FCA. This is an important next step in the case. The FCA will need to recover funds before any compensation can be paid to affected individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LPI is required to remove restrictions registered against the titles of 4 properties. These restrictions were used to force individuals to pay exorbitant fees to LPI. If these fees were not paid, then the individual could not sell or re-mortgage their property. In some cases, this trapped individuals into high-interest bridging loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;&lsquo;These sham brokers preyed on vulnerable people who were struggling financially and trapped them with exorbitant fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The defendants used a smokescreen of deception which cost consumers and lenders dearly. This was a complex case, but the ruling shows that these were serious breaches of our rules. &nbsp;It is only right that we can now pursue LPI, NPI, Daniel and Tony Stevens to compensate for the losses they caused the victims.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt found that LPI had contravened the general prohibition in section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) in relation to 26 further individuals identified by the FCA, and that Tony Stevens and Daniel Stevens were both knowingly concerned in these contraventions. He ordered the defendants to pay for losses caused to these and 45 other individuals.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In July 2020, the FCA obtained an interim injunction and a freezing order to stop these activities and freeze residential properties and other assets owned by Tony and Daniel Stevens and the 2 companies. Read the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-commences-civil-proceedings-relation-alleged-unauthorised-regulated-mortgage-contracts-and-sale" title="FCA commences civil proceedings in relation to alleged unauthorised regulated mortgage contracts and sale and rent back agreements">press release</a>&nbsp;in relation to the commencement of proceedings dated 13 July 2020. &nbsp;</p>

<div> MOU, ESG Data Platform, financing, collaboration, sustainability<br />
Summary:<br />
SET and EXIM Thailand collaborate to enhance sustainable finance, develop ESG-linked financing, and support businesses in achieving sustainability goals. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Thailand) to enhance the ecosystem for sustainable finance. This collaboration, under the ESG Data Linkage and Exchange Project, aims to leverage sustainability performance data of listed companies via the ESG Data Platform. In addition, the partnership will support the SET Carbon system for EXIM Thailand's clients to achieve sustainability goals, aligning with SET&rsquo;s commitment to driving all sectors towards sustainable growth.</p>
<p>SET and EXIM Thailand will jointly develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-linked financing in the third quarter of 2024, with the lending service scheduled to commence in 2025.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b> said that SET has recognized the growing demand for ESG data among investors and financial institutions to develop ESG-related financial and investment products for sustainable development. SET has accelerated the development of ESG data technologies and platforms to meet the demand. Currently, SET has a broad range of ESG data management systems, including the SET ESG Data Platform, which has been operational since 2023 and has compiled ESG data of over 700 listed companies. The upcoming SET Carbon system, slated for 2025, will enable listed companies and their supply chain partners to efficiently calculate and report greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SET unwaveringly fosters collaborations with both domestic and international entities to ensure continuous data exchange and utilization, particularly in using ESG data for fundraising and investment purposes.</p>
<p>The collaboration with EXIM Thailand is expected to increase opportunities for the business sector in accessing funding and financial tools, marking a significant step in developing a sustainable financial ecosystem in Thailand.</p>
<p><b>EXIM Thailand President Rak Vorrakitpokatorn</b> emphasized the banking sector's crucial role in driving balanced growth across economic, social, and environmental dimensions as well as tackling today&rsquo;s environmental challenges. Development banks worldwide are pivotal in providing financing that supports businesses in adapting and thriving, representing up to one-third of global Climate Finance. Positioned as Thailand&rsquo;s Green Development Bank, EXIM Thailand has continuously developed Greenovation to support environmentally friendly projects and businesses.</p>
<p>This partnership with SET represents a collaborative integration between public and private sectors, utilizing an internationally standardized database to propel the Thai financial sector towards sustainability. It also encourages businesses to become more aware of ESG. ESG data from SET will enhance the efficiency of EXIM Thailand's operations while promoting business access to various financial products and benefits, including participation in the Green Export Supply Chain. This will facilitate efficient and effective greenhouse gas management and reporting, compliance with international environmental standards, achievement of sustainable development goals, and drive Thailand towards carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>This partnership will facilitate data connectivity and exchange, increase operational flexibility, and create opportunities for businesses seeking investment to support sustainability goals. SET and EXIM Thailand will co-develop financial products, services, and benefits for stakeholders, while expanding the sustainability ecosystem to help Thai businesses achieve their sustainability and business objectives, particularly in climate change strategies.</p>

<title>Data Beta: Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Joint Data Standards Proposal, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<div> Interoperability, Legal Entity Identifier, Financial Data Transparency Act, FDTA, data standards
Summary:<br /><br />Implementation of FDTA for financial data transparency examined for costs, benefits, and practicality, emphasizing public input and flexibility in rulemaking. <div>
<p>I support issuing this proposal, which is the first step in implementing the Financial Data Transparency Act (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), which seeks to enhance the accessibility, usefulness, and interoperability of data reported to federal financial regulators. Together with other US financial regulators, we are proposing joint data standards, which we will then apply to our respective rulebooks in agency-specific rulemakings.</p>
<p>If well implemented, the FDTA could enhance the analytical capability of regulators, investors, and other market participants and reduce compliance costs for regulated entities. However, this result is not guaranteed. Mangling implementation could result in costs disproportionate to the benefits. FDTA regulations, for example, could drive municipal issuers away from securities markets, prevent companies from going and staying public, or force the publication of unreliable data. To maximize the potential for the FDTA to serve the public interest, we need broad public input. I urge commenters to address the questions in the proposing release and my additional questions below, as well as to provide advance thoughts on the second, agency-specific, phase of the FDTA rulemaking process.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Costs and benefits</i>: The Commission did not conduct an economic analysis for this proposal, so I particularly welcome commenters&rsquo; input on the proposal&rsquo;s costs and benefits and the economic consequences of subsequent choices that individual agencies might make in their second phase rulemakings.<ol>
<li>Costs of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the total direct and indirect costs of adopting the contemplated data standards? Do these costs vary based on factors such as firm size or type of regulatory filing?</li>
<li>How have standardized data costs changed over time? Will these trends continue?</li>
<li>How much of the FDTA compliance burden is likely to stem from the one-time cost of setting up new data systems as opposed to ongoing compliance costs?</li>
<li>Will certain types of entities, such as municipal issuers, bear disproportionate FDTA-related costs? If so, what can we do to reduce those costs?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Benefits of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the potential benefits of FDTA implementation?</li>
<li>How could the Commission maximize the utility of financial regulatory information filed in compliance with the FDTA-mandated data standards? For example, should the Commission work to reduce error rates in structured data filings?</li>
<li>In light of the Commission&rsquo;s broad discretion in implementing the second phase of FDTA rulemaking, are there areas where full application of these proposed data standards would be particularly helpful or unhelpful?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Financial Data Interoperability.&nbsp;</i>The FDTA aims to promote the interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><ol>
<li>What could the benefits of interoperability be in the intermediate and longer term? What level of interoperability is necessary to achieve these benefits?</li>
<li>What are the largest hurdles to interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators? How should we address those hurdles?</li>
<li>How could we achieve the benefits of interoperability without imposing unnecessary costs on reporting firms, particularly smaller ones?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Legal Entity Identifier</i>: The FDTA mandates a &ldquo;common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license for all entities required to report to&rdquo; the regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The proposal specifies this standard as&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), which the Global LEI Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) manages and supports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><ol>
<li>Mandating the adoption of any product or service managed by a third-party carries risks, including the possibility that the third-party could use its regulatory-mandated advantage to, for example, raise fees inordinately, demand obtrusive information from registrants, or provide poor service. Is this a risk of the LEI mandate? If so, how can we mitigate this risk, or does the existing regulatory oversight of the GLEIF already adequately manage this risk?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Would timely obtaining and maintaining the required LEIs be manageable for small entities and for large entities with many subsidiaries?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>How would an LEI mandate integrate with other entity identifiers such as the Central Index Key (&ldquo;CIK&rdquo;), which identifies EDGAR filers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>CUSIP and FIGI</i>:&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>The proposal&rsquo;s scope designates as an identifier of financial instruments the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (&ldquo;FIGI&rdquo;), which is &ldquo;established by the Object Management Group . . . an open-membership standards consortium.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The joint rulemaking does not include the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedure (&ldquo;CUSIP&rdquo;), a common securities identifier, because CUSIP is &ldquo;proprietary and not available for open license in the United States.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><ol>
<li>Does the FDTA&rsquo;s statutory mandate extend to financial instruments?</li>
<li>Is the proposing release correct that the FIGI does and the CUSIP does not meet the FDTA&rsquo;s criteria for designation as a joint standard? If CUSIP does not now meet the criteria, what changes would enable it to do so?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>What, if any, policy issues arise from the FIGI being managed by a standards consortium?</li>
<li>How should the Commission consider FIGI and CUSIP in setting data standards for financial instruments in the second-phase rulemaking?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Scope of the data standards</i>: To implement the FDTA successfully, we need to scope it properly and remain within statutory parameters.<ol>
<li>Did the joint regulators strike the right balance when choosing the proposal&rsquo;s scope, in light of the statutory mandate?</li>
<li>What policy issues should the Commission consider when adapting its rulebook to conform to the joint data standards, particularly given the statutory discretion afforded to the Commission (and other implementing agencies) in the second-phase rulemaking?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Principles-based regulation and maintaining updated FDTA standards</i>: Hardwiring a technology into a rule runs the risk of preserving that requirement far after that technology&rsquo;s expiration date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;To benefit from FDTA implementation, we need meaningful consistency of data standards across agencies, which requires at least some specificity regarding data standards. If we are not vigilant, however, the FDTA could inhibit data standards from evolving over time or force firms to maintain parallel data systems. The proposal affords some flexibility in data transmission and schema and taxonomy format standards,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;while specifying other data standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><ol>
<li>Does the proposal strike the right balance between principles and prescription? If not, how should the approach change?</li>
<li>Would the balance the proposal strikes allow data standards to be updated in a timely manner? If not, what would work better?</li>
<li>How often should regulators revisit the mandated standards to ensure that they remain current? Should we build a requirement to revisit the standards into the final rule?</li>
<li>How, if at all, will artificial intelligence or other technologies influence the need for structured data? How should we take these potential future developments into account in implementing the FDTA?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed rule is a reasonable first step in the FDTA implementation journey. For this process to have the best chance of unlocking the FDTA&rsquo;s promise and avoiding its peril, public discussion is essential. I welcome commenters&rsquo; thoughts on these questions and how the second phase should unfold, particularly given the meaningful flexibility that the joint regulators will have during that phase.</p>
<p>Joint rulemakings are inevitably challenging. I therefore particularly appreciate the hard work of staff in the SEC&rsquo;s Divisions of Corporation Finance, Economic and Risk Analysis, Investment Management, and Trading and Markets, and in the Offices of the Chief Data Officer, Credit Ratings, the General Counsel, and Municipal Securities, along with staff at the other financial regulators who have worked on this first stage of FDTA implementation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;This first phase of FDTA implementation deals only with standards applicable to all agencies, so some common standards used in SEC filings are not reflected in the proposal but could be reflected in the Commission&rsquo;s phase two rulemaking.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Data Standards, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Joint Data Standards, LEI, FDTA, Commission, proposal
Summary:<br />The Commission proposes joint data standards, including LEI, for financial reporting, considering concerns over mandating payments to private organizations. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>As part of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Congress directed the Commission and other financial regulatory agencies to jointly propose data standards for (1) certain collections of information reported to each agency by financial entities and (2) the data collected from the agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint standards with the other agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;One part of the proposal establishes International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17442-1:2020, Financial Services &ndash; Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), as the joint standard for the legal entity identifier. While LEI satisfies the FDTA&rsquo;s requirements for a joint data standard, I have concerns were the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and other agencies to ultimately mandate the exclusive use of LEI from a specific organization.</p>
<p>LEI is managed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) and issued through &ldquo;local operating units&rdquo; (&ldquo;LOUs&rdquo;). Although GLEIF is overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee, of which the Commission is a member, neither the committee nor any LOU is a federal or state regulator. Entities must pay a fee to an LOU both to initially obtain an LEI and to renew the LEI annually.</p>
<p>While the fee may be&nbsp;<i>de minimis</i>&nbsp;to some entities, mandating payments to a private third party as a condition to satisfying legal requirements raises significant concerns &ndash; especially when such fees are not subject to approval by Congress or the Commission. If a company wants to raise capital by filing a registration statement, then it needs to first purchase an LEI from a third party.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;If a school or water district seeks to issue tax-exempt bonds to pay for infrastructure, then it needs to purchase an LEI before it can submit materials to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The FDTA amends section 124(c)(1)(A) of the Financial Stability Act to require the joint standards to include &ldquo;a common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The term &ldquo;open license&rdquo; means a legal guarantee that a data asset is made available at no cost to the public and with no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing, or adapting such asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Given these concerns, the Commission should consider alternatives to requiring regulated entities to pay for something &ndash; such as an LEI &ndash; if free alternatives, such as the Central Index Key (CIK) used to make EDGAR filings with the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;or the file number issued by the Delaware Department of State&rsquo;s Division of Corporations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;are available and may also satisfy the FDTA&rsquo;s data standard requirements. One option, consistent with certain of the Commission&rsquo;s forms,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;is to require an entity to use and disclose its LEI only if that entity has already obtained one for other purposes.</p>
<p>I look forward to reviewing the public comments from investors and market participants on the LEI requirement and other aspects of the proposal. In receiving feedback, I am particularly interested in whether the joint data standards being proposed, including LEI, can be obtained or used by non-traditional business organizations that exist today or that may exist in the future, such as those in the crypto and digital assets industry.</p>
<p>Because of the Congressional mandate to undertake this rulemaking, I will support the joint proposal. I thank staff from across the Commission who worked on this proposal, and I would especially like to recognize the staff of the Office of the Chief Data Officer, the Division of Corporation Finance, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis for their involvement and engagement with my staff and me.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Rulemaking, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Aug. 2, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint data standards for information collected by nine financial regulators (the &ldquo;Agencies&rdquo;). Through the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), Congress mandated that the Agencies propose such standards. In fulfilling the Congressional mandate, I&rsquo;m pleased to support this proposal, as it will make financial data collected by the Agencies more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public.</p>
<p>Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.</p>
<p>The proposal puts forward standards with regards to data identifiers, as well as ways to transmit and structure data.</p>
<p>First, with regards to identifiers, the Agencies propose a number of identifiers related to entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For instance, with regards to entities, the joint proposal would establish Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;) as a common entity identifier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, as it relates to geographic jurisdictions, the proposed joint standards use U.S. postal service abbreviations, as well as country codes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;With regard to products and instruments, the proposed joint standard uses three internationally recognized standards for financial instrument identifiers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>All of these common identifiers are non-proprietary and available under an open license.</p>
<p>Secondly, the joint proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to transmitting and structuring data. Under the proposal, any specific format (e.g., eXtensible Markup Language) that enables the structuring and transmission of high-quality, machine-readable data would be permitted.</p>
<p>In addition, Congress required in the FDTA that the joint data standards must, to the extent practicable, &ldquo;use, be consistent with, and implement applicable accounting and reporting principles&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the Agencies are seeking comment on whether to establish joint data standards regarding existing definitions of generally accepted accounting and financial reporting terms. Doing so would benefit both investors and the financial entities who report data.</p>
<p>Upon finalization of these joint standards, Congress has mandated that the SEC and certain other Agencies issue Agency-specific rules that implement the standards. In accordance with the FDTA, Agencies will be permitted flexibility in considering how best to implement the final joint standards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Department of the Treasury, Commodity Futures Trading Commission<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for working with the SEC on this joint rule.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Data Transparency Act, joint data standards, financial regulatory agencies, interoperability <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC proposes joint data standards for financial regulatory agencies to promote interoperability and enable high-quality, machine-readable data submission from financial institutions. <div>
<p>Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed joint data standards under the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 that would establish technical standards for data submitted to certain financial regulatory agencies. Eight additional agencies have proposed or are expected to propose the joint standards: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>The proposed joint standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the agencies by establishing common identifiers for entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proposal will make financial data more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, the proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to data transmission and schema and taxonomy formats, which would enable financial institutions to submit high-quality, machine-readable data to the agencies.</p>
<p>The agencies are in various stages of approving the proposed joint standards, with some agencies scheduled to vote in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The public comment period for the proposed joint standards will remain open for 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<div> resolution, IMF, Executive Directors, Sub-Saharan Africa, representation
Summary: IMF Board of Governors approved a resolution to add a 25th chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on the Executive Board, effective November 1, 2024. <div>
<p>On July 16, 2024, the IMF Board of Governors, the highest decision-making body of the IMF, issued a new resolution to increase the number of Executive Directors on the IMF&rsquo;s Executive Board by adding a 25th chair intended for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>This resolution follows the call, made by the International Monetary and Financial Committee during the 2023 Annual Meetings in Marrakech, for the creation of a 25th chair to improve Sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s voice and representation and the overall balance of regional representation at the Board (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/10/14/pr23353-chairs-statement-forty-eighth-meeting-of-the-imfc">See Press Release 23/353</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board of Governors have taken an important step towards creating an additional 25th&nbsp;chair at our Executive Board to increase Sub-Saharan Africa's representation in IMF decision making, to make our Board more inclusive, and to reflect the region's role in the global economy,&rdquo; said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approval by the Board of Governors to change the size of the Executive Board requires an 85 percent majority of the total voting power. The Fund&rsquo;s membership approved the resolution allowing for the creation of a 25th chair, exceeding the required threshold.</p>
<p>The new Executive Board of 25 Executive Directors will take office on November 1, 2024.</p>

<div> exemption, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Singapore, swap execution facility, regulation <br />
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance.<br />
Summary: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it unanimously approved an amended order that exempts two recognized market operators (RMOs) authorized within Singapore from CFTC swap execution facility (SEF) registration requirements. The exempted RMOs are FMX Securities (Singapore) Pte. Limited and LMAX Pte. Ltd.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Section 5h(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides that the CFTC may grant such an exemption if it finds that a foreign SEF is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in the facility&rsquo;s home country.&nbsp;</span>Likewise, t<span>he CFTC may revoke exempt status when a facility is no longer authorized and/or in good standing in its home country.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On March 13, 2019, the CFTC issued an order determining the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulatory framework for approved exchanges (AEs) and RMOs satisfies the standard in CEA section 5h(g) to exempt a SEF from registration with the CFTC. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7887-19"><span>7887-19</span></a><span>] Under the order, MAS agreed to, on an ongoing basis, request such exemptions for facilities meeting certain legal requirements within Singapore. MAS also agreed to notify the CFTC when an AE or RMO no longer satisfies those requirements and to request the non-compliant facility be removed from exempt status.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This amendment brings the total number of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/International/ForeignMarketsandProducts/ExemptSEFs#Singapore"><span>exempted AEs and RMOs</span></a>&nbsp;<span>to 18.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>"Cboe reported another strong quarter with record net revenue of $514 million, diluted EPS of $1.33, and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $2.15, up a robust 21% from the second quarter of 2023," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "The second quarter results illustrate the durability of the Cboe business model with year-to-date net revenue increasing by a strong 8% and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;coming in 17% higher as compared to first half 2023 levels. I am incredibly pleased with the progress we continue to make as we work through our strategic review, the early output of which is evidenced by our solid expense management trends, improved year-over-year EBITDA margins, and additive capital allocation actions with $90 million of share repurchases during the second quarter and a total of $180 million for the first half of the year. Each component of our exchange ecosystem performed well during the second quarter, and we are well positioned for the second half of the year."</p>
<p>"Cboe reported strong 10% year-over-year net revenue growth in the second quarter as each category of our business posted solid year-over-year trends," said Jill Griebenow, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. "Cash and Spot Markets performance was robust with net revenues growing 15% during the second quarter of 2024. Derivative trends were also solid, up 11% year-over-year, and Data and Access Solutions delivered 5% year-over-year net revenue growth. Notably, adjusted EBITDA margins<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;reached 67% through the first half of 2024, up more than two percentage points as compared to the first half of 2023, and we returned nearly $300 million in capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Moving forward, we anticipate organic total net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to finish in the 6-8% range, up from our prior guidance of the higher end of 5-7%. We are reaffirming our Data and Access Solutions organic net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of 7-10%, but anticipate finishing at the lower end of the guidance range. Additionally, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted operating expense guidance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of $795 to $805 million. We have produced strong results for the first half of 2024 and look forward to delivering durable returns for shareholders in the quarters ahead."</p>

<li>Total operating expenses were $303.7 million versus $222.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $81.4 million, primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets recognized in the Digital reporting unit. Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $197.1 million increased 2 percent compared to $192.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services, partially offset by a decline in travel and promotional expenses.</li>
<li>The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 30.8 percent as compared with 30.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to the valuation allowance associated with the impairment of the Globacap investment. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;was 29.5 percent, down 0.2 basis points when compared with 29.7 percent in last year's second quarter.</li>

<p><b>Discussion of Results by Business Segment:</b></p>
<p><b>Options:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Options net revenue of $306.7 million was up $23.5 million, or 8 percent, from the second quarter of 2023. Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased primarily as a result of a 9 percent increase in index options trading volumes versus the second quarter of 2023. Access and capacity fees and market data fees were 3 percent higher than the second quarter 2023.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased $27.3 million, or 11 percent, reflecting a 1 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV") and a 9 percent increase in total options RPC compared to the second quarter 2023. The increase in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a higher percentage of total options volume.</li>
<li>Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 31.2 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 33.3 percent in the second quarter of 2023, a result of lower multi-list market share as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>North American (N.A.) Equities:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>N.A. Equities record net revenue of $98.3 million increased $7.5 million, or 8 percent versus the second quarter of 2023, reflecting higher net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>, proprietary market data fees, and access and capacity fees.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased by $7.0 million, or 25 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by stronger U.S. exchange and off-exchange net capture rates, as well as stronger volumes and market share in Canadian Equities as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>
<li>Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 11.4 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 12.7 percent in the second quarter of 2023 given higher off-exchange and closing auction share. Cboe's U.S. Equities off-exchange market share was 17.8 percent, down from 19.9 percent in the second quarter of 2023 as overall industry alternative trading systems ("ATS") market share declined as a percentage of off-exchange share. Canadian Equities market share rose to 15.0 percent as compared to 14.5 percent in the second quarter of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Europe and Asia Pacific (APAC):</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Europe and APAC net revenue of $54.3 million increased by 15 percent compared to the second quarter of 2023, reflecting growth in transaction and non-transaction revenues. On a constant currency basis<sup>2</sup>, net revenues were $55.2 million, up 17 percent on a year-over-year basis. European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was &euro;9.6 billion, up 4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2023 given a 10 percent increase in industry market volumes, partially offset by lower market share. Japanese Equities ADNV was 71 percent higher and Australian Equities ADNV was 12 percent higher than the second quarter of 2023.</li>
<li>For the second quarter of 2024, Cboe European Equities had 22.5 percent market share, down from 23.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Total market share was negatively impacted by elevated closing auction activity on listing venues and lower lit book market share. Cboe European Equities net capture rate increased 9 percent given a mix shift to higher capture products. Cboe Australia had 20.8 percent market share for the second quarter of 2024, up from 18.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Cboe Japan grew market share to 5.5 percent in the second quarter of 2024 from 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2023.</li>

<p><b>2024 Fiscal&nbsp;Year Financial Guidance</b></p>
<p>Cboe provided guidance for the 2024 fiscal year as noted below.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Organic total net revenue growth<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;is expected to be in the range of 6 to 8 percentage points, up from previous guidance calling for the higher end of 5 to 7 percentage points in 2024.</li>
<li>Anticipates lower end of organic net revenue<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;growth range from Data and Access Solutions of 7 to 10 percentage points in 2024.</li>
<li>Reaffirms adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $795 to $805 million. The guidance excludes the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets of $92 million; the company reflects the exclusion of this amount in its non-GAAP reconciliation.</li>
<li>Reaffirms depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $43 to $47 million, excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.</li>
<li>Reaffirms minority investments are expected to contribute a $37 to $43 million benefit in 2024 to non-operating (expenses) income. Anticipates that $33 to $37 million of the benefit will come in the earnings on investments line and $4 to $6 million through the other (expense) income, net line.</li>
<li>Reaffirms the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for the full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of 28.5 to 30.5 percent. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation.</li>

<div> Westminster magistrates court, Peterson Okoh, mortgage fraud, FCA, unauthorized activities
Summary:
Westminster magistrates court hearing alleged mortgage fraud by Peterson Okoh, accused of unauthorized activities and false representation, sent to trial. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Peterson Okoh (of Peckham, London SE15) appeared in Westminster magistrates court on 31 July 2024 for allegedly advising on and arranging mortgages, between January 2018 and December 2023, without being authorised.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also alleges a significant number of mortgage applications advised on and arranged by Mr Okoh contained false information and/or were supported by forged documents.</p>
<p>Mr Okoh has been charged by the FCA with 3 counts of fraud by false representation and 1 count of carrying on regulated activities without authorisation. Mr Okoh has pleaded not guilty to all counts.</p>
<p>The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 28 August 2024.</p>
<p>Peterson Okoh has been released on conditional bail with conditions of home residence, not to carry on acting as a mortgage advisor while unauthorised, and not to contact prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly pending his next appearance.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of Birth: Peterson Okoh (01/10/1960)</li>
<li>The most obvious example of a 'regulated mortgage contract'&nbsp;is a loan made to an individual to enable the individual to buy a home for themselves where the loan is secured on that home. For legal definition of a 'regulated mortgage contract',&nbsp;please refer to Article 61(3)(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001.</li>
<li>Carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation is contrary to section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and is punishable by a fine or up to 2 years in prison.</li>
<li>Fraud by False Representation is contrary to section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 and is punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Okoh has been charged with: 
<ul>
<li>3 counts of fraud by false representation; and</li>
<li>1 count of breaching s19 FSMA</li>

<div> Expansion, Dormant Assets Scheme, Charities, Social Enterprises, Financial Assets
Summary:<br /><br />Millions in dormant funds unlocked for charities and social enterprises, supporting UK growth. FCA facilitates expansion of Dormant Assets Scheme to empower local businesses. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>We have amended our rules and guidance to enable dormant investment assets and client money to be available to the Dormant Assets Scheme (DAS).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Millions in dormant funds have been unlocked for charities and social enterprises, as new rules set out today facilitate the expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme.&nbsp;<span>This second phase of the expansion will bring dormant investment assets and client money in scope.</span></p>
<p>Led by industry and backed by government, the Dormant Asset scheme aims to reunite people with their financial assets. Where that is not possible, this money supports UK growth through good causes such as getting young people into work or offering affordable credit to families.</p>
<p>Since 2011, the UK Dormant Assets Scheme has unlocked more than &pound;745m for social and environment initiatives, from over &pound;1.35 billion in dormant bank and building society accounts. The expansion of the scheme is estimated to potentially unlock a further &pound;880m.</p>
<p>This initiative not only reunites people with their lost money but also empowers local businesses to drive positive change across local communities.</p>
<p>The policy statement outlines technical changes in our Handbook to facilitate the full expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme in the remaining expanded asset classes. The FCA&rsquo;s intention is to ensure any Handbook changes allow firms to participate in the Dormant Assets Scheme and consumers to access reclaims.</p>

<p><span>Iress (IRE: ASX) today announces it has completed the sale of its UK Mortgage Sales &amp; Originations (&ldquo;Mortgages&rdquo;) business to Bain Capital Tech Opportunities LP (&ldquo;Bain Capital&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.iress.com%2Fdocuments%2F1542%2FASX_Release_Iress_enters_into_binding_agreement_with_Bain_Capital_to_sell_its__UxPxwIT.pdf/1/0102019111f0aac0-77f3768b-943b-44c6-9f5a-c48dfcbd9b26-000000/uUtdU57tYXCnq8p9riaw4x8Cqm4=385" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>As announced on 15 March 2024</span></a><span>, Bain has purchased the UK Mortgages business for a total cash consideration of &pound;85m ($A167m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>) before costs.</span></p>
<p><span>Iress&rsquo; Mortgages business provides mortgage sales and origination software (MSO) and associated consulting services to banks and building societies in the UK. Iress acquired the Mortgages business over 10 years ago, during which time it has become a leading provider of mortgage origination software in the UK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group CEO, Marcus Price, said</span></strong><span>: &ldquo;This is the fourth and largest divestment we have successfully executed under our transformation program. The net proceeds of all divestments have been used to retire debt, with our debt to leverage ratio seeing considerable improvement - paving the way for a return to maintainable dividends. As we enter the final months of our transformation program, we can already see a stronger Iress with an improved earnings profile, balance sheet strength and execution discipline priming Iress for future growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group Executive - Wealth &amp; UK, Harry Mitchell</span></strong><span>, said: &ldquo;Completion of the sale was contingent on the novation of existing MSO client contracts to the new owners and we&rsquo;re pleased to have gained the full support of all Mortgages clients. We are confident this is a great result not only for Iress, but also for our clients and people, with Bain Capital fully committed to re-investing in the technology and capabilities that power MSO. Iress&rsquo; UK operations now have a streamlined focus on its core competencies, and we remain committed to driving excellence for our clients in the UK.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Net proceeds from the sale are expected to be approximately &pound;75m ($A147m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>). Iress will provide support services for a period of up to 12 months after the transaction on a cost recovery basis to ensure a smooth transition.</span></p>

<title>ASX Commences Final Of Two Consultations To Decide Scope And Implementation For CHESS Replacement</title>

<div> consultation, ASX, CHESS replacement, settlement cycle, T+1
Summary:<br />ASX consults on CHESS replacement and T+1 settlement cycle, proposes implementation in 2026 and 2029, seeks stakeholder feedback by September 2024.<br /> <div>
<p>ASX today released a public consultation paper which proposes the CHESS replacement settlement and subregister services be implemented in 2029. The paper is the second of two consultations undertaken by ASX this year to gather industry feedback on scope and implementation for the project to replace Australia&rsquo;s cash equities clearing and settlement system (CHESS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also today, ASX published its summary of feedback received on the industry whitepaper it released in April that sought input on a potential move to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1.</p>
<p>Taken together, these papers underscore the ongoing stakeholder engagement ASX has been undertaking to ensure it continues to work closely with industry on the delivery of CHESS replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance</b> said &ldquo;Our commitment to transparent and collaborative consultation is central to the success of the CHESS replacement project as well as Australia&rsquo;s approach to T+1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposal to implement CHESS replacement across two main releases reflects how we&rsquo;ve listened to industry feedback. The staged approach to implementation, where we are delivering the clearing services first in Release 1, followed by delivery of settlement, subregister and additional clearing enhancements in Release 2 is designed to manage several factors, including materially reducing delivery risk and allowing for industry readiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stakeholder input provided via working groups and other forums is incorporated in the consultation paper published today and is reflected as part of the functional scope of Release 2. Industry driven improvements outlined in the consultation paper include items such as continuous netting, account segregation and corporate action elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to the industry whitepaper on T+1 settlement were also a key input into the consultation paper, helping inform the proposed sequencing of CHESS replacement implementation stages and the potential move to T+1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of responses from industry suggest a clear preference to avoid implementing T+1 at the same time as Release 2 of CHESS replacement,&rdquo; Mr Triance said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In light of the feedback received to the industry whitepaper and having regard to the experiences of transitioning to T+1 in other markets we have presented a number of options on timing to transition to T+1 in Australia, and outlined the risks and benefits of each of the options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a decision is made to move to T+1, the paper recommends the option where that would take place at an appropriate time after the implementation of CHESS replacement Release 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX confirmed in June that the delivery of Release 1 is expected to occur in H1 2026. This consultation paper proposes that Release 2 be delivered in 2029, aligning with indicative timeframes previously communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Next steps in consultation process</b></h4>
<p>We encourage feedback from CHESS users and software providers (including both external vendors and CHESS users developing in-house systems), as well as other interested stakeholders on the proposals outlined in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASX is seeking stakeholder feedback by Friday, 13 September 2024. ASX will then take time to review submissions and proposes to provide a consultation response paper in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p>CHESS is the clearing and settlement system for Australia&rsquo;s cash equities market. ASX is undertaking a project to replace CHESS and in November 2023 ASX announced it would proceed with a product based solution design for CHESS replacement that would be delivered by global technology provider TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).&nbsp;</p>

Summary: The MAS has set up a Review Group to strengthen Singapore's equities market, focusing on market challenges, listings, regulatory enhancements, and stakeholder participation. <br /><br /> <div>

<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced that a Review Group has been set up to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore. The Review Group will be chaired by Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister for Finance and Board Member of MAS, and comprise key private sector stakeholders and public sector representatives.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>A dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain, alongside Singapore&rsquo;s growing private equity and venture capital ecosystem. A deep and liquid public equities market enables companies to access capital as they expand regionally and globally. It also allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies. Improving the attractiveness of Singapore&rsquo;s equities market can therefore enhance Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub. This in turn complements Singapore&rsquo;s innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Government has introduced various initiatives to support enterprise financing and enhance Singapore&rsquo;s equities markets. These include the set-up of cornerstone funds to support initial public offerings of high-growth companies, introduction of corporate structures and share classes to facilitate such listings, and measures to improve research coverage.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will build on these efforts to position Singapore&rsquo;s equities market for growth. The Group will consider additional initiatives to improve the vibrancy of our equities market, and study ways to galvanise greater private sector participation in this effort, including from capital market intermediaries, investors, and listed companies. The Review Group will be supported by two workstreams:</p>
<p>a. The Enterprise and Markets workstream will aim to address market challenges, foster listings, and facilitate market revitalisation; and<br />b. The Regulatory workstream will focus on enhancing the regulatory regime to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.<br /><br />The Terms of Reference and composition of the Review Group are set out in Annex A.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Through the two workstreams, the review process will involve stakeholders with expertise and experience in diverse fields in the capital markets, including corporate finance, investment banking, asset management, legal services, and corporate governance. The Review Group will recommend a set of measures to strengthen the Singapore equities market and complete its report within 12 months.<br /><br /></p>

<title>ASIC’s First Greenwashing Case Results In Landmark $11.3 Million Penalty For Mercer</title>

<div> Penalty, Greenwashing, Financial Services Industry, ESG Claims, Mercer Superannuation<br />
Summary:<br />
- Mercer Superannuation fined $11.3 million for misleading ESG claims<br />
- ASIC's first greenwashing case for financial services industry<br />
- Found to have made misleading statements about sustainable investment options<br />
- Importance of accurate ESG claims highlighted<br />
- Additional cases and infringement notices issued for alleged greenwashing practices<br /> <div>
<p>In a landmark case for ASIC, the Federal Court has ordered Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited to pay a $11.3 million penalty after it admitted it made misleading statements about the sustainable nature and characteristics of some of its superannuation investment options.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, 'This was ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case brought before the Federal Court; a landmark case both for ASIC and for the financial services industry. It demonstrates the importance of making accurate ESG claims to investors and potential investors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court found Mercer made misleading statements on its website about seven &lsquo;Sustainable Plus&rsquo; investment options offered by the Mercer Super Trust, of which Mercer is the trustee. These statements marketed the Sustainable Plus options as suitable for members who &lsquo;are deeply committed to sustainability&rsquo; because they excluded investments in companies involved in carbon intensive fossil fuels like thermal coal. Exclusions were also stated to apply to companies involved in alcohol production and gambling.</p>
<p>The Court found members who took up the Sustainable Plus options had investments in companies involved in industries the website statements said were excluded, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 companies involved in the extraction or sale of carbon intensive fossil fuels (including AGL Energy Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Glencore PLC and Whitehaven Coal Ltd),</li>
<li>15 companies involved in the production of alcohol (including Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, Carlsberg AS, Heineken Holding NV and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd), and</li>
<li>19 companies involved in gambling (including Aristocrat Leisure Limited, Caesar&rsquo;s Entertainment Inc, Crown Resorts Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;s matter is a strong example to the financial services industry of the greenwashing action we will take. We will continue to monitor the market for ESG-related claims that cannot be validated by evidence to ensure the market is fair and transparent,&rsquo; Ms Court added.</p>
<p>When handing down his decision Justice Horan remarked, &lsquo;The contraventions admitted by Mercer are serious. They arose from failures by Mercer to implement adequate systems to ensure that ESG claims in relation to its superannuation products were accurate, and to monitor and enforce the application of any sustainability exclusions associated with such ESG claims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Horan also commented: &lsquo;&hellip;it is vital that consumers in the financial services industry can have confidence in ESG claims made by providers of financial products and services.  As is the case in many other industries, consumers may place great importance on ESG considerations when making investment decisions. Any misrepresentations in relation to ESG policies or practices associated with financial products or services, whether as an aspect of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; practices or otherwise, undermines that confidence to the detriment of consumers and the industry generally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mercer Super has agreed to pay ASIC&rsquo;s costs.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Strike Force, unfair pricing, illegal pricing, anticompetitive practices
Summary:
SEC Chair addresses the mission of the SEC, enforcement actions against unfair pricing, rulemaking projects, market oversight, and the potential impact of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good afternoon. I&rsquo;m honored to take part in the first meeting of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>As President Joe Biden said at our most recent Competition Council meeting with him, if you are &ldquo;engaging in illegal practices that are fraudulent or unfair or deceptive or anti-competitive &hellip; we will enforce the law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain that which sits in the middle: fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Thus, guarding against deceptive, fraudulent, or anticompetitive practices is at the heart of what we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>When Congress established the SEC 90 years ago, they embedded antifraud provisions in our key statutes. Congress gave us additional authorities in the 1970s to promote competition and guard against anticompetitive practices when the word competition was added to our statute 20 times.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC pursues these important mandates from Congress every day in overseeing the more than $110 trillion capital markets.</p>
<p>As President Biden further said when announcing the Strike Force, capitalism without competition is not capitalism.</p>
<p>The SEC addresses unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive business practices in all of our work, through enforcement, rulemaking, and market oversight.</p>
<p>The SEC, working through its Enforcement Division, is the cop on the beat for the securities markets. The Commission brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, resulting in $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;While there are many cases related to fraud or unfair practices, I&rsquo;ll highlight three that directly relate to unfair and illegal pricing. Earlier this year we settled an action against TIAA-CREF for making recommendations to retail customers while failing to disclose that substantially equivalent lower-cost shares were available.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we settled a case against Wells Fargo for overcharging advisory accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In 2022, we charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries for not disclosing they were sweeping cash to its affiliate bank, loaning it out, and then keeping the difference between the interest earned on the loans and what it paid in interest to clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through rulemaking projects, works to enhance competition across all three parts of our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;We do so by promoting transparency, access, and fair dealing in the markets. Among the most important projects are focusing on promoting greater competition and access in the $27 trillion U.S. treasury markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;as well as the more than $50 trillion equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through our market oversight, examines registrants. We review the tens of thousands of filings we receive every year from broker-dealers, investment advisers, stock exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory organizations, and issuers. As we conduct such oversight, we stay true to the mandates Congress laid out to guard against fraud and deceptive practices and promote competition.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to mention what may be one of the most transformative technologies&mdash;not only for this time but perhaps our lives, artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This technology offers tremendous promise for individuals and our economy. At the same time, all of our agencies will be pressed to grapple with what this technology means when it comes to guarding against deception, fraud, and anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>As it relates to the securities markets, bad actors might seek to use AI to deceive or defraud the public, investors, and the market. Make no mistake, though, under the securities laws, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>As it relates to the potential for anticompetitive behavior, we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere in our economy that one or a small number of tech platforms can come to dominate a field. Due to cost, reach, and network economics, we may see the same come to pass in the fields of AI and related data aggregation. Further, bad actors might try to use AI to game the system and signal to competitors about pricing or otherwise to undermine competition.</p>
<p>I look forward to collaborating with others here on these important matters.</p>

<div> Supreme Court of Canada, BCSC, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, financial sanctions, Poonians
<br />
The BCSC seeks changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after the Supreme Court ruled that financial penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy. The court ruled in favor of BCSC's disgorgement orders but against administrative penalties. BCSC has had over 40 debts extinguished through bankruptcy since 2001. The BCSC is calling for a revision of the law to address this loophole.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The BCSC is calling for changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after a Supreme Court ruling regarding financial penalties and bankruptcy. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is calling for changing the federal&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some financial sanctions can be extinguished through the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>The court, in a 5-2&nbsp;<a href="https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/20555/index.do" target="_blank">decision</a>, said that administrative penalties, which are imposed by the BCSC and other Canadian securities regulators to deter future misconduct, can be eliminated from a person&rsquo;s debt upon being discharged from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case demonstrates one of the many challenges securities regulators face in collecting financial penalties from lawbreakers,&rdquo; said BCSC Chair &amp; CEO Brenda Leong. &ldquo;The fact that administrative penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy seriously undermines securities regulators&rsquo; duty to protect investors, and highlights a significant flaw in federal bankruptcy law that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruling came in litigation between the BCSC and a B.C. couple, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian. A BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2014/73-bcsc-panel-finds-that-five-bc-residents-engaged-in-market-manipulation" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;that they ran a pump-and-dump scheme involving an Ontario company whose shares traded on the TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel concluded that the Poonians inflated the company&rsquo;s share price through trading among themselves, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and then illegally obtained approximately $7 million by selling shares to unsuspecting buyers, many of them living paycheck to paycheck. Most of them had no idea they were victims of misconduct until they were contacted by the BCSC.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel levied two types of financial sanctions against the Poonians:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative penalties of $13.5 million, intended to deter future misconduct by the Poonians and others who might contemplate committing similar wrongdoing</li>
<li>Disgorgement of $5.6 million, representing the amount the Poonians obtained from their illegal activity. Any funds collected for disgorgement orders can be returned to victims of that misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Poonians have not made any effort to pay. After the BCSC imposed its sanctions, they filed for bankruptcy. The Poonians asked the B.C. Supreme Court to extinguish their debts, including those owed to the BCSC but that request &ndash; which was opposed by the BCSC &ndash; was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2020/33-bc-couple-owing-19-million-to-bcsc-must-remain-in-bankruptcy" target="_blank">denied</a>&nbsp;by the court in 2020.</p>
<p>The BCSC also applied to the court for an order that its financial sanctions against the Poonians persist, even if all of the couple&rsquo;s other debts are extinguished through bankruptcy, because the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;allows some types of debts to survive bankruptcy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debts arising from a fine, penalty or restitution order imposed by a court, and</li>
<li>Debts arising by obtaining property or services by false pretenses or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCSC argued that its sanctions &ndash; both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders &ndash; met those criteria.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously agreed with the BCSC that &ldquo;the Poonians&rsquo; scheme to mislead and exploit investors amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation.&rdquo; But it did not agree that the sanctions, despite being registered with a court, qualified as court-imposed orders.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s five-member majority said there is a direct link between the amounts of the disgorgement orders and the Poonians&rsquo; fraudulent conduct, so those debts to the BCSC survive bankruptcy. But the administrative penalties, the majority said, arose most directly from the BCSC&rsquo;s decision to sanction the couple, and only indirectly from the Poonians&rsquo; unlawful conduct. So those penalties, the majority said, are extinguished if the Poonians exit bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two justices dissented, saying that the administrative penalties, along with disgorgement, should persist to &ldquo;ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that the Poonians, as a result of this decision, will forever owe $5.6 million, which represents the money they obtained from their pump-and-dump scheme,&rdquo; Leong said. &ldquo;However, this has always been about more than this one case, and we are disappointed that people who cheat or swindle investors can avoid paying administrative penalties through an exit from bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2001, more than 40 individuals and companies, owing a total of about $80 million to the BCSC, have gone through bankruptcy, and as a result, have had their BCSC debts extinguished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its written opinion, said that Parliament could have drafted the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;to expressly say that financial sanctions of regulatory bodies or administrative tribunals are exempt from bankruptcy discharge. But the Act does not say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An obvious solution is to revise the law to deal with this &lsquo;escape hatch,&rsquo;&rdquo; Leong said.</p>

<title>The EBA And ECB Release A Joint Report On Payment Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) published today a joint Report on payment fraud data. The report assesses payment fraud reported by the industry across the European Economic Areas (EEA), which amounted to &euro;4.3bn in 2022 and &euro;2.0bn in the first half of 2023. The Report confirms the beneficial impact of strong customer authentication (SCA) on fraud levels.</span></p>
<p>The Report examines the total number of payment transactions and the subset of fraudulent transactions in terms of value and volume. In addition to the aggregated values, the Report also presents data based on volumes and also sorted by type of payment instruments, i.e. credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals, and e-money transactions.</p>
<p>SCA-authenticated transactions featured lower fraud rates than non-SCA transactions, especially for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes. Furthermore, fraud shares for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes, were 10 times higher when the counterpart is located outside the EEA, where the application of SCA is not legally required and may therefore not have been requested. Hence, the report confirms the beneficial impact of the SCA requirements that were introduced by the PSD2 and the supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj">technical standards</a>&nbsp;that the EBA had issued in 2018 in close cooperation with the ECB.</p>
<p>The Report also finds that losses due to frauds were distributed differently among liability bearers depending on the payment instrument.</p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB will continue to monitor fraud data and going forward, will publish the aggregate data on an annual basis. This initial rReport presents observations in a descriptive way, while future editions will also include explanations of the data and observed trends.</p>
<p><span>Background and legal basis</span></p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB, in their respective roles as supervisory authority of payment service providers and overseer of payment systems, instruments, schemes and arrangements, closely monitor developments in payment fraud. Both the EBA and the ECB thereby rely on statistical information on the volumes and values of payment transactions and corresponding fraud reported by payment service providers (PSPs) located in the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 96(6) of PSD2, PSPs are required to report statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities (NCAs). NCAs, in turn, are required to provide both the EBA and the ECB with this data in aggregated form. In support of these provisions, the EBA Guidelines on fraud reporting under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2018/05, hereafter &ldquo;EBA Guidelines&rdquo;), which apply since 1 January 2019, specify the data that should be reported under the PSD2. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 1409/2013 of the European Central Bank on payments statistics (ECB/2013/43), as amended (hereafter &lsquo;ECB Regulation on payments statistics&rsquo;), requires PSPs located in the euro area to report inter alia detailed information on payment fraud to their national central banks, which in turn shall share the data in aggregated form with the ECB. &nbsp;Data under both the EBA Guidelines and the ECB Regulation on payments statistics is reported on a semi-annual basis.&nbsp;<br />This Report, jointly prepared by the EBA and the ECB, presents a comprehensive overview of the latest data collected under the above-mentioned frameworks.</p>

<p>ISI Markets, the leading provider of macroeconomic data, industry, company and sovereign intelligence, today announces the acquisition of EPFR, the global leader in fund flows and allocation data.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of EPFR, ISI Markets gains a proprietary macro funds flow dataset and proposition, reinforcing ISI&rsquo;s strategy of curating and delivering difficult-to-source &ldquo;macro to micro&rdquo; data, helping inform buy- and sell-side firms&rsquo; strategies and investment decisions across global markets, including on the world&rsquo;s fastest growing and highest potential economies.</p>
<p>EPFR, which is renowned for its breadth, granularity, and frequency of global fund flows coverage, will operate alongside ISI Markets&rsquo; leading global macroeconomic and financial market data business, CEIC. Combining the firms&rsquo; offerings provides ISI Markets&rsquo; clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and banks, comprehensive data and insight on investor sentiment and money movements across regions and asset classes, whilst streamlining workflows and enhancing investment models for economists, quantitative analysts and investment professionals with the tightest integration of datasets.</p>
<p>Steve Pulley, CEO of ISI Markets, commented: &ldquo;The strategic acquisition of EPFR marks a pivotal step in the evolution of ISI Markets. Bringing greater scale in terms of breadth of buy- and sell-side relationships across North America and Europe and material expansion of our proprietary data asset, ISI Markets is now positioned as a unique global data and intelligence platform providing excellent coverage of developed markets whilst remaining best in breed on emerging markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pascal Ambrosi, Partner at Montagu, commented: &ldquo;This acquisition reflects the strong synergy that has developed between EPFR and ISI Markets over time, as the two became truly global service providers with a strategic focus on more deeply supporting buy- and sell-side client workflows. The transaction will also enable the companies to expand their geographic reach and tap into markets in North America/Europe and Asia respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acquisition follows the partnership announced earlier this year which saw ISI Markets integrate EPFR fund flows and asset allocation data across all major asset classes, tracking over 150,000 traditional and alternative fund-share classes, into CEIC&rsquo;s workflow and analytics platform. By combining EPFR's data with over 3,500 other economic and financial data sources, the combined offering has equipped investment professionals with the ability to better understand the linkages between economic factors, investor sentiment and asset class performance.</p>
<p>EPFR was carved out from Informa PLC by Montagu in October 2022 and is the second acquisition by ISI Markets since Montagu acquired ISI in December 2020 and follows the acquisition of REDD Intelligence, the leading emerging market corporate and sovereign intelligence provider for high yield, private credit, distressed and event-driven special situations.&nbsp; ISI Markets also offers EMIS, the award-winning AI powered market intelligence and research platform.</p>
