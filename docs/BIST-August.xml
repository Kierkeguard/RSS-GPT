<div> Bitcoin, volatility, price, rebound, cryptocurrency <br>
Summary:<br>
Bitcoin's price dropped from $70,000 to $50,000 but rebounded to $60,000 in a week. Market sentiment remains bullish. Mercuryo saw a significant increase in transaction volume. <br> <div>
<p>Bitcoin has faced significant volatility in recent days. Earlier this week, its price plummeted from $70,000 to approximately $50,000. However, in less than a week, Bitcoin has rebounded to $60,000.</p>
<p>Commenting on these price fluctuations, Arthur Firstov, Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo&mdash;a leading provider of payment infrastructure in the digital token sector&mdash;shared his insights:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is resurgent after a dramatic switch from fear to greed. As the digital token market is pulled higher crypto enthusiasts are once again focusing on the king of crypto breaching the $100,000 mark. While fears over the US economy and events such as Mt. Gox and the selling of Bitcoin by the German government has spooked investors in a week that began with a &lsquo;crypto Black Monday,&rsquo; the overriding sentiment appears to be that the bull market is intact. Regardless, a belief in the underlying technology among an army of retail investors remains unwavering. When the cryptocurrency market crashed on Monday this week, Mercuryo experienced an 82 per cent week-on-week increase in transaction volume amid a stampede of those buying the dip.&rdquo;</p>

<div> regulatory measures, market supervision, investor confidence, Auction Matching Method, Dynamic Price Band
Summary:<br />The Stock Exchange of Thailand implements Auction Matching Method, Dynamic Price Band, and Minimum Resting Time to enhance market supervision and boost investor confidence. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has announced three additional regulatory measures to enhance market supervision and boost investor confidence, following recent amendments to short selling and program trading regulations. The new measures, effective September 2, 2024, are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Auction Matching Method will be required for all investors trading securities that SET has designated as the trading surveillance measures at Level 2 and above, in addition to the existing measures for securities with abnormal trading conditions. </li>
<li>Dynamic Price Band for individual securities of &plusmn;10 percent from the latest execution price will be imposed. This measure will complement the existing daily ceiling and floor price limits of &plusmn;30 percent from the previous day&rsquo;s closing price, providing an additional mechanism to mitigate securities price fluctuation. </li>
<li>Minimum Resting Time before an order can be amended or cancelled is set at 250 milliseconds. This measure aims to curb excessively frequent order updates and cancellations that could potentially mislead the market about high demand for particular securities. </li>
</ol>
<p>For more detailed information, please visit SET's website: <a href="http://www.set.or.th/">www.set.or.th</a> under the menu &ldquo;Rules &amp; Regulations&rdquo; section, then &ldquo;Rules &amp; Circular Letters&rdquo;.</p>

<div> Second cohort, investED Leadership Programme, Malaysian graduates, capital market, industry partners
<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia's investED Leadership Programme aims to enhance employability by offering training and job placements in the capital market industry.
<br /><br />Summary: The investED Leadership Programme provides training and job placements in the capital market industry for Malaysian graduates, in collaboration with industry partners. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has commenced the second cohort of the investED Leadership Programme, an SC-led initiative to help ensure a sustainable talent pipeline for the capital market.</p>
<p>Launched by Prime Minister Dato&rsquo; Seri Anwar Ibrahim in June 2023, the flagship graduate programme is also designed to help enhance the employability of local graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initiative is the first ever such tie-up between the SC, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Higher Education, the capital market industry and universities. investED is opened to all Malaysian graduates from all disciplines.</p>
<p>For the second cohort, the investED Leadership Programme offered placements to 268 trainees. On 1 August 2024, 197 trainees began a one-month comprehensive classroom training at the Asia School of Business in Kuala Lumpur. This will be followed by a sixmonth on-the-job experience with leading industry partners, beginning 1 September 2024.</p>
<p>The first cohort of 169 candidates graduated in February this year after completing a sixmonth job placement with 53 capital market partner companies. More than 65% of them were offered jobs with investED's partners.</p>
<p>This year, the investED programme has roped in a wider array of partner companies. They include investment banks, stockbroking firms, fund management companies, equity crowdfunding platforms, and advisory services.</p>
<p>So far, 50 partner firms have agreed to place the second cohort&rsquo;s trainees. Host companies with the highest placement offered include the SC, Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, Moomoo Securities Sdn Bhd, Hong Leong Group, Affin Hwang Investment Bank and Maybank.</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said the collaboration with the various companies will provide valuable exposure to different aspects of the industry, offering trainees a well-rounded experience.</p>
<p>Since its inception, investED has also engaged 77,185 university students via eight career fairs and 36 career talks nationwide. It plans to engage more students, universities and partner firms this year.</p>
<p>The programme is aimed at improving the capital market knowledge of 9,000 university students and provide up to 600 jobs in the capital market industry between 2023 and 2025.</p>

<li><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/financial-advice-update/#subscribe">keeping up to date with financial advice news</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="maintaining"></a>Maintaining accurate records on the financial advisers register</h2>
<p>AFS licensees are reminded to check that the information about their financial advisers on the financial advisers register is correct. AFS licensees should pay particular attention to their adviser&rsquo;s approved qualification(s), ability to provide tax (financial) advice services, business address and telephone number.</p>
<p>Any incorrect or out-of-date information must be rectified by lodging a &lsquo;maintain&rsquo; transaction on ASIC Connect.</p>
<p>ASIC recently identified errors and inconsistencies on the financial advisers register, including in relation to records of approved degrees and qualifications: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-142mr-asic-urges-afs-licensees-to-correct-records-on-the-financial-advisers-register/">24-142MR</a>&nbsp;<em>ASIC urges AFS licensees to correct records on the financial advisers register</em>&nbsp;(1 July 2024).</p>
<p>Common errors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>failure to record the degrees accurately in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01848/latest/text"><em>Corporations (Relevant Providers Degrees, Qualifications and Courses Standard) Determination 2021</em></a>&nbsp;(Determination)</li>
<li>recording degrees that are not approved degrees, but are professional designations (e.g. &lsquo;Certified Financial Planner&rsquo;)</li>
<li>recording degrees that are not approved degrees, but are bridging courses (which may be listed in the Determination but must be coupled with another qualification to meet the requirements of the professional standard), and</li>
<li>recording qualifications that are not approved qualifications under the Determination (e.g. the Financial Adviser Exam, Australian Qualifications Framework 1&ndash;5 qualifications, and training or qualifications listed in Regulatory Guide 146&nbsp;<em>Licensing: Training of financial product advisers</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-146-licensing-training-of-financial-product-advisers/" title="RG 146 Licensing: Training of financial product advisers">RG 146</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a serious offence to knowingly provide false or misleading information to ASIC or to fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information provided to ASIC is true and correct. It is also an offence to fail to update the financial advisers register within 30 business days of a financial adviser&rsquo;s details changing.</p>
<p>ASIC will shortly be commencing a compliance program to ensure that the information recorded on the financial advisers register about approved qualifications is correct and take action where necessary.</p>
<h2><a id="assessing"></a>Assessing adviser qualifications</h2>
<p>If you are an advice licensee, among other things, you must ensure your relevant providers (i.e. advisers who are authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products) comply with the &lsquo;qualifications standard&rsquo; in section 921B(2) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Corporations Act) before authorising them, even if they have been previously authorised by another advice licensee.</p>
<p>Financial advisers who are existing providers have until 1 January 2026 to meet the qualifications standard. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/quick-reference-guide-applying-the-financial-adviser-professional-standards/" title="Quick reference guide: Applying the financial adviser professional standards">quick reference guide</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website.</p>
<p>Generally, an existing provider who meets the criteria for an experienced provider can rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard and the professional year standard without needing to undertake further education and training. For more information on the experienced provider pathway, see Information Sheet 281&nbsp;<em>FAQs: Relevant providers &ndash; Accessing the experienced provider pathway</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/faqs-relevant-providers-accessing-the-experienced-provider-pathway/">INFO 281</a>).</p>
<p>Under section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act, a person who is, or is to be, a relevant provider&nbsp;<span>must have completed a bachelor or higher degree, or equivalent qualification, approved by the Minister</span>. This applies to both existing providers and new financial advisers, as well as advisers with foreign qualifications. For a list of approved degrees and equivalent qualifications see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01848/latest/text">Determination</a>.</p>
<h3>Assessing your advisers&rsquo; qualifications against the Determination</h3>
<p>To assess whether your adviser(s) has completed an approved bachelor or higher degree, or equivalent qualification, under the Determination, see the guidance for AFS licensees to check qualifications on the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Qualification, exam and professional development</a>&nbsp;page of the ASIC website.</p>
<p>As an AFS licensee, you must ensure that the qualifications exactly match those listed in the Determination. If a domestic qualification has been completed in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Determination, but does not satisfy the prescribed conditions (e.g. unit codes or names do not match or different commencement dates), then an application can be made to Treasury to assess whether the qualification satisfies section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act: see&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.treasury.gov.au/education-standards/domestic-qualifications">Domestic qualifications: Criteria for assessment</a>&nbsp;on the Treasury website.</p>
<p>If an adviser has foreign qualifications, an application can also be made to Treasury to assess whether these qualifications are equivalent to an Australian bachelor&rsquo;s or higher degree: see&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.treasury.gov.au/education-standards/foreign-qualifications">Foreign qualifications: Criteria for assessment</a>&nbsp;on the Treasury website.</p>
<p>If Treasury establishes that an adviser has completed an approved degree or qualification, the relevant provider&rsquo;s authorising AFS licensee must record this on the financial advisers register as an approved degree or qualification. This can be completed during the appointment process or by submitting a maintenance transaction if the adviser has already been appointed by the AFS licensee.</p>
<h2><a id="cold-calling"></a>ASIC&rsquo;s review of cold calling for superannuation switching business models</h2>
<p>In our 2023&ndash;27 Corporate Plan, ASIC announced a cross-sector project focused on deterring cold calling for superannuation switching business models. Our review identified that some cold calling businesses are using high-pressure sales tactics to induce consumers into taking unnecessary and inappropriate superannuation switching advice, leading to poor outcomes for clients. These adverse outcomes range from superannuation erosion due to high fees and charges, to the risk of a reduced superannuation balance due to inappropriate investment in high-risk and/or low-quality superannuation products.</p>
<p>Some of the cold calling operators &ndash; which make unsolicited calls to consumers after obtaining their personal information from third-party data brokers or by using online click-bait &ndash; have lead-generation and referral arrangements with a small subset of financial advisers who typically recommend consumers switch to super products that charge significant fees.</p>
<p>ASIC has observed considerable volumes of superannuation fund movement as a result of cold calling conduct, including inflow into platforms, high-risk property investments and significant payments to cold calling operators.</p>
<p>ASIC also observed some cold calling businesses bypassing data brokers by posting click-bait advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These advertisements often promote superannuation comparison calculators that give consumers the impression their existing superannuation fund is underperforming.</p>
<p>ASIC identified several areas of concern and is reminding advice licensees and financial advisers of their respective obligations to act in the best interests of consumers when providing financial services.</p>
<p>Advice licensees should ensure they have in place adequate monitoring and supervision arrangements to detect concerning conduct and to make sure their advisers are acting in the best interests of their clients.</p>
<p>Deterring cold calling for superannuation switching models is an ASIC priority. We will continue to take action, where appropriate &ndash; including enforcement action &ndash; against individuals or entities who are engaging in misconduct.</p>
<p>You can find more information on ASIC&rsquo;s review of cold calling for superannuation switching business models in our news item&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/exposing-high-pressure-cold-calling-tactics-and-social-media-click-bait-leading-to-superannuation-switching/" title="Exposing high-pressure cold calling tactics and social media click-bait leading to superannuation switching">Exposing high-pressure cold calling tactics and social media click-bait leading to superannuation switching</a>&nbsp;(7 May 2024).</p>
<p>We have issued Information Sheet 282&nbsp;<em>Unsolicited contact leading to financial advice</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/unsolicited-contact-leading-to-financial-advice/">INFO 282</a>) for unlicensed entities that engage with consumers, leading to financial advice. It sets out how the financial services laws apply to these entities and reminds them of their responsibility to ensure that their conduct complies with the law.</p>
<p>ASIC has also launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/media-centre/news-asic-warns-consumers-to-just-hang-up-on-superannuation-cold-callers">consumer awareness campaign</a>, encouraging consumers to &lsquo;<span>just hang up</span>&rsquo; when contacted by cold calling operators and to&nbsp;<span>&lsquo;just scroll past&rsquo;</span>&nbsp;social media click-bait advertisements.</p>

<h2><a id="cyber"></a>Cyber security &ndash; Third-party exposure</h2>
<p>The practice of outsourcing services and products is crucial to most organisations operating in today&rsquo;s economy, with 76% of leading global businesses outsourcing IT functions. While financial services businesses can outsource their services to third-party suppliers, they cannot outsource the associated risks and liabilities.</p>
<p>Recently, ASIC released findings from our 2023 Cyber Pulse Survey: see Report 776&nbsp;<em>Spotlight on cyber: Findings and insights from the cyber pulse survey</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-776-spotlight-on-cyber-findings-and-insights-from-the-cyber-pulse-survey-2023/" title="REP 776 Spotlight on cyber: Findings and insights from the cyber pulse survey 2023">REP 776</a>). Worryingly, 44% of participating organisations admitted to not managing third-party or supply chain risk.</p>
<p>ASIC has observed a growing number of cyber attacks on Australian organisations stemming from third-party attacks that exploit weaknesses in an organisations supply chain, giving them easy access to the organisation&rsquo;s systems and networks.</p>
<p>AFS licensees from across Australia have told ASIC they consider cyber security the biggest risk to their business, listing it as a high priority item for board meetings and noting they run regular staff training at all levels of their business. AFS licensees have moved to reinforce their internal cyber security after a series of high-profile incidents from late 2022. With many organisations acting to improve internal defences, their focus must now turn to mitigating third-party exposure &ndash; the new frontline in cyber risk management.</p>
<p>For example, the SolarWinds breach of 2020 exploited a vulnerability in SolarWinds&rsquo; platform, giving the threat actor access to 3,000 email accounts across 150 organisations, including government agencies and multinational corporations. The breach cost each affected organisation an average of US$12 million.</p>
<p>To enhance the cyber resilience of Australia&rsquo;s financial institutions against known threat actors, the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) developed the cyber and operational intelligence-led exercises (CORIE) framework: see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cfr.gov.au/publications/policy-statements-and-other-reports.html#2022">Revised CORIE framework and rollout</a>&nbsp;on the CFR website. CORIE uses threat intelligence to simulate adversary attacks and assess the cyber resilience of an organisation. Recent CORIE simulations have exposed vulnerabilities in third-party controls, including instances where third parties held administrator-level access to critical systems.</p>
<p>The recent Latitude Financial cyber attack underscores the need for enhanced scrutiny of third parties with access to core systems. While IT outsourcing is essential for many organisations, basic controls &ndash; like multifactor authentication (MFA) for external providers &ndash; could minimise breach risks.</p>
<p>Another concerning trend demonstrated by CORIE simulations is the use of weak passwords. Even with complex password creation requirements, users can find ways to craft weak passwords like &lsquo;Pa$$w0rd123!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>MFA is one of the most effective techniques available to protect organisations from a cyber incident. Where MFA is not available, the Australian Signals Directorate&rsquo;s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) recommends the use of passphrases: see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/securing-your-accounts/passphrases">Passphrases</a>&nbsp;on the ACSC website. These measures should be implemented as part of a broader cultural shift throughout an organisation, driven by employee education, cyber awareness training and rigorous third-party risk assessment.</p>
<p>To mitigate cyber risk, organisations must take an active approach to identifying, assessing, and monitoring third-party cyber risks. We encourage organisations to start by asking three simple questions:</p>

<div class="expandCollapseButtons"><button class="accordionExpand">Expand all</button><button class="accordionCollapse">Collapse all</button></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="registration"></a>Financial adviser registration</h2>
<p>On 16 February 2024, the registration requirement commenced whereby all relevant providers, except provisional relevant providers, must be registered before providing personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products.</p>
<p>The registration requirement is an&nbsp;<span>ongoing obligation</span>&nbsp;and is separate to the requirement for AFS licensees to appoint their relevant providers to the financial advisers register. Self-licensed relevant providers must also be registered. AFS licensees and relevant providers should ensure they understand the circumstances when new registration is required and the circumstances that may lead to a relevant provider being deregistered.</p>
<p>AFS licensees must register their relevant providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>after they authorise and appoint an adviser to the financial advisers register</li>
<li>when they appoint an adviser who has moved from another AFS licensee</li>
<li>when an adviser changes roles from a &lsquo;provisional relevant provider&rsquo; to a &lsquo;relevant provider&rsquo;, and</li>

<p>From 16 February 2024, both the AFS licensee and the relevant provider will be in breach of the law if an unregistered relevant provider provides personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products.</p>
<p>ASIC recently commenced a compliance program in relation to the registration requirement and has already identified that a number of advisers have not been registered following their move from one AFS licensee to another.

<h2><a id="rep-779"></a>Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em></h2>
<p>Around $1.1 trillion of Australians&rsquo; total retirement savings are invested in the choice product segment. The decision of where to invest these savings is one of the most important decisions a member will make &ndash; and is often made based on recommendations by a financial adviser.</p>
<p>A 2018 Productivity Commission inquiry and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&rsquo;s (APRA) annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/choice-heatmap">Choice Heatmap</a>&nbsp;highlighted persistent underperformance of some investment options within the choice sector. In 2023, APRA found one in five choice investment options with an 8-year history significantly underperformed the investment return benchmarks.</p>
<p>To understand why some choice super fund members remained in these poorly performing investment options, we looked at what superannuation trustees, financial advisers and advice licensees did in relation to performance. Each of these stakeholders is responsible for assisting Australians to achieve good retirement outcomes.</p>
<p>Financial advisers have an important role, and their clients (i.e. fund members) trust them to act in their best interests when providing advice about how to achieve their retirement objectives.</p>
<p>On 21 February 2024, we published our observations in Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>).</p>

<h2><a id="provisional"></a>Provisional relevant providers</h2>
<p>In March 2017, the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Amendment (Professional Standards of Financial Advisers) Act 2017&nbsp;</em>commenced and introduced reforms to the Corporations Act to raise the education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers. The professional standards require financial advisers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an approved qualification</li>
<li>pass the financial adviser exam</li>
<li>participate in 40 hours of continuing professional development each year, and</li>
<li>comply with the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00117">Code of Ethics</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to become a financial adviser must also complete a full-time professional year that includes at least 1,500 hours of work and activities and 100 hours of structured training (a total of 1,600 hours).</p>
<p>For more information about the professional standards, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Qualification, exam and professional development</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website, and</li>
<li>the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00117">Code of Ethics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ASIC&rsquo;s supervision activities, we conducted a review with a cross section of AFS licensees, which included understanding their experience with employing a provisional relevant provider. We asked them details about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the process for taking on the responsibility of training and supervising a provisional relevant provider</li>
<li>the processes they used to verify and record training hours</li>
<li>how they selected and monitored the supervisor of the provisional relevant provider, and</li>
<li>the process for certifying the provisional relevant provider has meet all of the requirements for completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All licensees involved reported a positive experience of supporting a provisional relevant provider through their professional year. Some listed the benefits as supporting and assisting with their succession planning, and appreciated that they could mentor and train a provisional relevant provider from within the business rather than hiring an external adviser.</p>
<p>We also observed licensee practices that could be improved, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>putting policies in place about who is qualified and suitable to be a supervisor</li>
<li>developing processes for how licensees will monitor professional relevant providers and the supervisor, including their advice, once the provisional relevant provider is in the third and fourth quarters of their professional year, and</li>
<li>having detailed processes in place for final sign off of the completion certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFS licensees are reminded of the importance of record keeping throughout the professional year. Most licensees indicated they were able to comply with the record-keeping obligations by using, and in some cases amending, the templates created by the former standards body, the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority. Others created their own methods for maintaining logbooks to record the structured and unstructured training hours, and to demonstrate and record that all key competencies were satisfactorily acquired.</p>

<title>Concurring Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Joint Data Standards Proposal</title>

<div> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Financial Data Transparency Act, Joint Data Standards Proposal, regulated entities, costs <br />
<br />
Summary: The author supports the Financial Data Transparency Act but urges consideration of the costs imposed on regulated entities.<br /> <div>
<p><span>I respectfully concur from the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Financial Data Transparency Act (FDTA) Joint Data Standards (&ldquo;Joint Data Standards Proposal&rdquo;) to require each respective agency to implement certain data standards for its regulated entities because there is insufficient discussion of the impact and costs associated with the adoption of these new data standards that will apply across the banking and financial services sector (including small entities as set forth under the Regulatory Flexibility Act). &nbsp;While I support the FDTA&rsquo;s mandate, I believe the Joint Data Standards Proposal would be improved by addressing head-on the elephant in the room&mdash;the very real costs that will be imposed on potentially tens of thousands of firms of all sizes that will eventually have to update their systems and records to adhere to the new data standards. I encourage all commenters to address the costs and benefits of the Joint Data Standards Proposal, including the necessary future agency rulemakings that will subsequently follow. I thank Ted Kaouk, Tom Guerin, Jeffrey Burns, and the staff of the CFTC, and all the other agencies for their efforts on this proposal.</span></p>

<title>CFTC Approves A Joint Rule Proposal To Establish Technical Data Reporting Standards</title>

<div> standards, data reporting, financial regulatory agencies, Financial Data Transparency Act, public comment
Summary:<br /> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed uniform data standards for reporting to multiple financial regulatory agencies, promoting interoperability and common identifiers.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today voted to jointly propose and request public comment on the establishment of technical data reporting standards with other financial regulatory agencies. The proposal would establish uniform data standards for the collections of information reported to the CFTC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Department of the Treasury. The proposal would also establish uniform data standards for data collected from these financial regulatory agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Comments on the proposal are due 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposed standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the financial regulatory agencies through the adoption of common identifiers for legal entities, financial instruments, and other data. In addition to proposing the use of common identifiers, the proposal would also further standardize the format and transmission of data to financial regulatory agencies.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposed rule is part of the implementation of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (FDTA). Although the CFTC is not specifically referenced in the FDTA, the Secretary of the Treasury designated the CFTC as a covered agency on May 3, 2024. While the designation does not require the CFTC to issue individual rules adopting the proposed technical data reporting standards, this request for comment will give interested parties an opportunity to provide input at this early stage.</span></span></p>

<div> whistleblower, CFTC, digital assets, enforcement action, whistleblower program
Summary: The CFTC awarded a whistleblower over $1 million for information about digital asset misconduct, highlighting the program's success in tackling violations and protecting whistleblowers. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced a whistleblower award of over $1 million to a whistleblower who provided significant information and assistance that led the CFTC to bring an enforcement action connected to digital asset markets.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Identifying unlawful conduct in the digital asset marketplace is a major priority for the CFTC, especially as everyday Americans are increasingly victimized by digital asset scams,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;During the last fiscal year, digital asset cases accounted for almost 50% of the CFTC&rsquo;s docket, and the majority of whistleblower tips that year were related to digital assets.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Whistleblowers have increasingly played a significant role in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement actions in the digital assets space,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, the whistleblower provided sufficiently specific and credible information that assisted the CFTC in bringing a successful action.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>CFTC based its enforcement action on&nbsp;<span>whistleblower</span>-<span>provided information about improper trading&nbsp;</span>that was unknown to&nbsp;<span>the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $380 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling nearly $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Anyone with information related to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTC&rsquo;s rules and regulations can submit a tip electronically by filing a&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip"><span><span><span>Form TCR</span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;(Tip, Complaint or Referral) online</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Getting To Grips With Treasury Clearing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SEC, US Treasury, reforms, documentation, market liquidity
Summary:
SEC US Treasury reforms require extensive documentation, recalibration of capital rules, and resolution of legal and operational issues. Collaboration is vital for successful implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>When it comes to the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) US Treasury reforms, one thing is very clear: there&rsquo;s an awful lot to do and not a lot of time to do it. From the development of documentation to the recalibration of certain capital rules, there&rsquo;s an enormous laundry list of tasks that needs to be worked through &ndash; something that will require time and a collective effort from the entire industry.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247">SEC finalized its regulations last December</a>, which include a requirement to clear certain Treasury cash transactions from December 31 next year and Treasury repos from June 30, 2026. Among other things, market participants will need to assess existing and future clearing models to determine which best suits their needs. Legal documentation will need to be developed, negotiated and executed, and regulatory-compliant structures for the segregation of client margin will need to be put in place and tested. All of this work comes against a backdrop of concern about the need to maintain and enhance market liquidity, particularly during periods of stress.</p>
<p>For our part, ISDA will continue to engage closely with members and regulators and assist with implementation where we can. SIFMA is leading the work to develop the documentation, and we&rsquo;re participating in that working group. ISDA is also providing input on the optimal clearing models. We&rsquo;ve published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/02/23/isda-clearing-model-comparison/">comparison of various clearing models</a>&nbsp;for US Treasury transactions and derivatives that will be updated as new models emerge, and we recently submitted responses to the SEC on proposed rule changes by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) &ndash; one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/17/isda-submits-comments-to-ficc-on-proposed-rule-changes/">clearing models and margin segregation</a>&nbsp;and one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/08/06/isda-letter-on-ficcs-proposed-rulebook-changes/">trade submission requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Solving these legal and operational issues will be critical, but it&rsquo;s also important that the US prudential framework is calibrated so it is risk appropriate and supports market liquidity.</p>
<p>One example is the lack of recognition in the revised US capital framework for cross-margining programs, such as the one offered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/january/23/cme-group-and-dtcc-launch-treasury-cross-margining-arrangement-for-clearing-members">FICC and CME Group</a>&nbsp;for transactions based on US Treasury securities and interest rate futures &ndash; an issue ISDA is exploring in partnership with FIA. These services allow firms to obtain initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of transactions, but there are no commensurate benefits from a capital perspective under the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. As more Treasury securities and repos are cleared as a result of the SEC&rsquo;s rule, a lack of recognition for cross-margining will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing.</p>
<p>ISDA has also worked with SIFMA to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">propose several calibration changes</a>&nbsp;to the Basel III endgame proposals and the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIB) to ensure the rules do not disproportionately hamper the ability of banks to act as intermediaries. These include changes to certain aspects of the rules for credit valuation adjustment and modifications to the complexity and interconnectedness categories of the G-SIB surcharge, following analysis that the current proposals would increase capital for client clearing businesses at US G-SIBs by more than 80%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on top of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/05/isda-submits-letter-to-us-agencies-on-slr-reform/">letter we sent to US prudential regulators</a>&nbsp;earlier this year drawing attention to the fact that the non-risk-based supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) may impede banks&rsquo; capacity to participate in US Treasury markets and facilitate access to cleared markets, especially during periods of stress. We believe this is something that should be carefully assessed by regulators.</p>
<p>All of these issues need to be resolved before we&rsquo;re in a position to implement Treasury clearing safely and efficiently. The question is whether they can be completed in the time available, and this is something we&rsquo;ll be discussing with members in the coming months. In the meantime, we encourage all market participants to engage with the relevant working groups at ISDA or elsewhere &ndash; everyone will need to work together to get this done.</p>

<div> Commodity Futures Trading Commission, historic judgment, FTX Trading Ltd., Alameda Research LLC, fraud <br />
Summary:<br />Today, the CFTC announced a historic $12.7 billion settlement with FTX and Alameda for fraud, lack of customer protections, and conflicts of interest. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>Introduction</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Today, in a historic judgment with a $12.7 billion settlement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) announced the entry of a consent order in its litigation against FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX) and Alameda Research LLC (Alameda). Today&rsquo;s announcement sends a clear message regarding the Commission&rsquo;s intent to hold fraudsters accountable. The consent order, entered by Judge P. Kevin Castel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against FTX and Alameda filed on December 13, 2022.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;The amended complaint charged defendants with two counts of fraud and material misrepresentations in connection with the sale of digital assets and alleged that defendants&rsquo; actions caused the loss of billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FTX and Alameda have agreed to findings of liability on each of the charges alleged in the amended complaint. The consent order, among other obligations, imposes:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>$8.7 billion in restitution;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>$4 billion in disgorgement;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A permanent injunction prohibiting FTX and Alameda from engaging in further violations of the charged Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A permanent injunction prohibiting FTX and Alameda from trading for themselves or others, soliciting or accepting funds for trading, registering or claiming an exemption from registration with the Commission in any capacity, or acting as a principal of any registered person.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>The total restitution and disgorgement amount of $12.7 billion is a historic judgment that will enable the Commission to compensate victims for the losses they suffered as a result of this massive fraud.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s resolution demonstrates the Commission&rsquo;s strong commitment to achieving accountability, deterring future misconduct, and promoting compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations. The resolution sends a clear message that fraud in the derivatives markets will not be tolerated and that wrongdoers will be held accountable.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I commend the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement and the Commission on today&rsquo;s landmark resolution. Yet, much work is left to be done. Going forward, we must prioritize efforts to protect customers in markets with regulatory gaps, where customers may be at higher risk due to the absence of adequate safeguards.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have called on the Commission before, and I do so again today, to take urgent action to adopt a holistic rule that directly addresses concerns such as conflicts of interest, risk management, transparency and oversight.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Every market for every asset subject to the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction must have effective customer protections including, for example, segregation of customer funds, property, and assets.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Customer Protection Rules are the Cornerstone of Vibrant Derivatives Markets and a Well-Functioning Financial System</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The vibrancy of derivatives markets depends on customers&rsquo; ability to trust that their funds will be safely held by custodians. Customers must be assured that their hard-earned money will not be misused, lost, or worse yet, stolen, by those whom they have entrusted with its safekeeping. In the absence of trust, the custodial relationship cannot thrive, derivatives markets suffer, and the entire financial system is harmed. Customer protection rules, in particular those rules protecting customer funds, are therefore crucial to the vibrancy of derivatives markets and a well-functioning financial system.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span>As directed by the CEA, the Commission has developed, adopted, and implemented rules that protect customers in derivatives markets, including rules that protect customer funds, property, and other assets</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;held by a custodian. Such rules require custodians to segregate and separately account for customer funds. A custodian may not commingle customer funds.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As additional safety measures, custodians must also meet certain minimum capital requirements, file periodic and annual financial reports, maintain books and records, be subject to examinations, and comply with a host of other obligations. These measures are intended to promote transparency, monitor and manage risks, and enable oversight over the activities of custodians.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Notwithstanding the Commission&rsquo;s customer protection rules and efforts to preserve customer funds, customers have experienced significant losses in both heavily regulated markets as well as emerging markets, such as in the digital asset and cryptocurrency space. The rise of retail participation in emerging markets adds to the urgency of ensuring that customer funds are protected and that the integrity and stability of our markets is maintained.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>An Absence of Customer Protection Rules and Gaps in Regulation Enabled FTX to Misappropriate Billions of Dollars in Customer Funds</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On November 11, 2022, customers and our markets experienced the devastating effects of the precipitous collapse and shocking bankruptcy of FTX, which resulted in the loss of over $10 billion in customer funds.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Investigations into FTX&rsquo;s demise revealed a concerning lack of customer protections, including commingling of customer funds, using customer funds to extend a line of credit to an affiliate, and investing customer funds in nonpermitted investments through an affiliate, among others. Customers and the public were not alerted to FTX&rsquo;s ongoing misconduct due to the absence of crucial regulation over digital assets needed to establish appropriate risk management mechanisms to address conflicts of interest and other related issues, a lack of transparency, and inadequate oversight.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Conflicts of Interest Plagued FTX and Alameda</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>From the beginning, FTX and Alameda had significant conflicts of interest issues stemming from their vertically-integrated market structure. A gap in regulation, however, allowed these issues to go unaddressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Bankman-Fried founded Alameda in November 2017, as a digital asset trading and investment firm. In late 2018, he and other Alameda employees began to build what would ultimately become FTX, a centralized digital asset trading platform. Once FTX was launched, no later than May 2019, Alameda began operating as the primary market maker on FTX&rsquo;s trading platform. Bankman-Fried controlled both FTX and Alameda, serving as a signatory on core corporate agreements and bank accounts for both entities. Throughout their operations, FTX and Alameda regularly shared employees, office space, systems, communication channels, and accounts. FTX and Alameda relied on each other&rsquo;s personnel, assets and resources to conduct their operations. FTX and Alameda also regularly transferred large amounts of assets between the entities, often without documentation or effective tracking.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have raised the alarm, time and time again, about conflicts of interest and other concerns in emerging asset classes and the urgent need for the Commission to adopt a holistic rule that addresses these issues.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Segregation and Restrictions on the Use and Investment of Customer Funds are Fundamental Customer Protections</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At the core of customer protection rules is the fundamental principle that custodians must segregate and separately account for customer funds that they receive to margin, guarantee or secure the trades of the customer. A custodian is strictly prohibited from commingling customer funds with its own funds and from using or investing customer funds in violation of the CEA and Commission regulations.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Transparency and Oversight are Crucial to Detecting and Preventing Misconduct</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Disclosures, reporting and examinations are critical to creating transparency into business operations and functions and enabling customers and the public to have proper oversight over business conduct. It is imperative that the Commission and other regulators have proper oversight and transparency into the digital asset and cryptocurrency ecosystem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On November 11, 2022, FTX and more than 100 of its affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. FTX&rsquo;s collapse unleashed a wave of failures across the digital asset and cryptocurrency ecosystem and left numerous customers with devastating losses.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On December 13, 2022, in the criminal case parallel to the Commission&rsquo;s civil case, the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Bankman-Fried on eight counts, including fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span>In November 2023, jurors found Bankman-Fried guilty of misappropriating billions of dollars in customer funds deposited with FTX. Bankman-Fried was convicted of two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. On March 28, 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in this massive fraud scheme and has begun serving his sentence.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FTX&rsquo;s failure and the catastrophic consequences of its collapse confirm that there is no time to waste. The time is now for the Commission to adopt a comprehensive rule addressing customer protections.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I commend the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, including Carlin Metzger, Nina Ruvinsky, Yusuf Capar, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R. Williamson, and Robert T. Howell, for their work on this matter.</span></span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Obtains $12.7 Billion Judgment Against FTX And Alameda - Restitution And Disgorgement Damages To Pay Fraud Victims</title>

<div> CFTC, FTX, fraud, injunction, restitution
Summary:<br /><br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission obtained a $12.7 billion judgment against FTX for fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The judgment includes restitution and disgorgement. FTX falsely represented its safety and security to customers. The CFTC will not seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX and will subordinate its monetary claims to those of the victims of the FTX fraud scheme. The CFTC complaint charged Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX, and two former FTX executives with orchestrating a scheme to defraud. The court entered consent orders of judgment on liability against two former FTX executives, leaving the case pending as to the four individual defendants including Bankman-Fried. The CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded victims, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a consent order of permanent injunction and other equitable relief against&nbsp;FTX Trading Ltd.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alameda Research LLC&nbsp;(together, FTX) and ordered FTX to pay $12.7 billion in monetary relief to FTX customers and victims of FTX&rsquo;s fraud. The order requires FTX to pay $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered as a result of the massive fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Samuel Bankman-Fried, his now-bankrupt FTX group of companies, and a core group of FTX insiders. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8638-22">8638-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8644-22">8644-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23">8669-23</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the order finds FTX violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, imposes injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations as well as trading and registration prohibitions, and requires FTX and Alameda to cooperate with the CFTC in its ongoing litigation. The order finds FTX and Alameda made material misrepresentations and omissions to customers. The court noted that FTX touted itself as &ldquo;the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto,&rdquo; and that customer assets, including digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, were held in &ldquo;custody&rdquo; by FTX while stating FTX segregated customer assets from FTX&rsquo;s own assets as a general principle, when in fact customer funds were commingled and misappropriated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a related settlement agreement approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the CFTC agreed not to seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX and to subordinate its monetary claims to those of victims of the FTX fraud scheme. As described by FTX in its proposed reorganization plan filed in the bankruptcy proceeding, payments by FTX towards its CFTC disgorgement obligation will be used to further compensate victims through a supplemental remission fund. The plan remains subject to approval in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>FTX used age-old tactics to create an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets. But the basic regulatory tools, like governance, customer protections, and surveillance that exist to identify misconduct and ultimately prevent collapse, were simply not there,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like countless other CFTC crypto resolutions, including major players&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8837-23">Binance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8412-21">BitMEX</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21">Tether</a>, this resolution with FTX is consistent with the enforcement commitments I have long made as Chairman. But, as I have been saying for years, this is just the tip of the iceberg. In the absence of digital asset legislation to fill regulatory gaps, entities will continue to operate in the shadows without these basic tools of sound regulation, sharpening their deceptive practices and continuing to dupe customers."</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement Director Ian McGinley added,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only is this multi-billion dollar recovery for victims the largest such recovery in CFTC history, we achieved it with remarkable speed. FTX&rsquo;s massive fraud collapsed 21 months ago and in that time the CFTC investigated, filed a complaint, and achieved what many thought was impossible at the time of the collapse - a resolution to compensate victims for the losses they suffered. I commend our Chicago-based team for their tireless efforts on behalf of FTX&rsquo;s victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The consent order stems from the CFTC complaint filed December 13, 2022 against Bankman-Fried and FTX, and amended December 21, 2022, to include two former FTX executives, Caroline Ellison and Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang. The CFTC complaint charged Bankman-Fried, who controlled FTX and Alameda, with orchestrating a scheme to defraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court entered consent orders of judgment on liability against Wang and Ellison on December 23, 2022. In a related case, the court entered a consent order of judgment as to liability and partial injunctive relief against Nishad Singh, a third FTX insider, on April 13, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against FTX, leaving the case pending as to the four individual defendants including Bankman-Fried. In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded victims, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Tax Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Carlin Metzger, Nina Ruvinsky, Yusuf Capar, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R. Williamson, Robert T. Howell, Gretchen Lowe, and former staff member Bryan Hsueh.</p>
<p>Alex Case, Margaret Aisenbrey, and Anne Stukes of the Office of General Counsel also contributed to this matter.</p>

The Group aims to raise 70 million euros to finance the Company's next growth phase by issuing 1.750.000.000 new shares.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img title="One Verdi Park, One United Properties landmark residential development in Bucharest, Romania" /></p>
</div>
<p><i>"Since becoming a public company, we have consistently delivered on the promises made to our investors, with a clear focus on expanding our business. Our successful IPO in 2021 was a pivotal moment that enabled our strategic expansion into the premium residential segment, exemplified by the remarkable success of One Cotroceni Park. Similarly, our office division, which now boasts a 95% lease ratio, has fulfilled our commitment to investors, driven by our belief that Bucharest deserves world-class office spaces to establish itself as a leading European work hub. Today, our construction sites span 12 developments, comprising more than 4,000 residential units and nearly 45,000 sqm of office and commercial spaces. Our vision for the future includes entering the affordable premium housing segment, where we see significant growth potential. The planned share capital increase is the next milestone for this growth, and we invite our esteemed shareholders to participate and increase their investment in One United Properties by approximately 10% of their existing holdings. This capital infusion accelerates our ambitious growth plans, positioning us to double our business within the next five years and potentially quadruple it over the next decade, while maintaining our LTV at a prudent level,"&nbsp;</i>said Victor Capitanu, co-CEO of One United Properties.</p>
<p>The share capital increase operation will be organized in two stages. In the first stage, the shareholders who purchased ONE shares by the date of guaranteed participation, August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024, will be entitled to subscribe the new shares, respecting the preference rights, at the nominal value of 0.2 lei. The preference rights, having symbol ONER03, were loaded in the shareholders' accounts on August 7<sup>th</sup>. The preference right will be tradeable on the Main Market of the Bucharest Stock Exchange between August 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 13<sup>th</sup>. Therefore, those who want to subscribe to new shares but do not have any or sufficient preference rights will be able to buy them at the price set in the market.</p>
<p>The first stage of the share capital increase will start on August 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and will last for 32 calendar days, until September 19<sup>th</sup>. To subscribe to one new share in stage 1 of the share capital increase at 0.2 lei, an investor must hold 2,1879186 ONER03 preference rights. The shares that remain unsubscribed during the first stage might be offered in a private placement at a price established by the Board of Directors decision, considering the price formed during the bookbuilding process.</p>
<p>60% of the capital intended to be raised by the Company has already been committed by the two co-founders and executive members of the Board of Directors, Victor Capitanu and Andrei Diaconescu, as well as the Chairman of the Board, Claudio Cisullo and Board Member, Marius Diaconu.</p>
<p>The capital raised in the share capital increase operation will be used to expand One United Properties' addressable market beyond its current residential segment focus of luxury, high-end, and premium developments and will accelerate the development of the affordable premium residential segment, which targets Bucharest's middle class. The Company has land under negotiation for 10,000 residential units exclusively for this sub-segment, with the first memorandum of understanding for a 21-hectare plot of land that will host 5,000 units already signed.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, One United Properties sold and pre-sold 452 apartments and commercial units with a total surface of 43,809 sqm, 624 parking spaces, and other unit types for 123.3 million euros. At the end of May 2024, pre-sales started at the second phase of One Lake District, where 867 units are being built. Consequently, as of June 30th, 2024, 66% of the available units under development and delivered were sold out.</p>
<p>As of June 30th, 2024, One United Properties had&nbsp;in ownership, or under pre-SPA, 285,100 sqm&nbsp;of land locations for further development, with total above-ground gross building rights (GBA) of approximately 988,000 sqm. All these land plots are currently in the planning phase. The Group estimates the construction of&nbsp;7,000 apartments, services for communities, and 146,000 sqm of rental commercial buildings.&nbsp;Out of the commercial buildings, 121,000 sqm will host offices and the remaining 25,000 sqm are located within buildings that will undergo restoration.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Progresses Framework For Driving Long-Term Value For Workplace Pension Savers</title>

<div> Regulatory framework, pension schemes, transparency, value, performance
Regulatory bodies propose a new framework to focus on long-term value and performance, not just costs, ultimately providing better retirement savings.<br /><br />Summary:
The Financial Conduct Authority, Department for Work and Pensions, and Pensions Regulator are collaborating to implement a new framework focusing on long-term value and performance for pension schemes. <div>
<p align="left">Pensions savers stand to benefit from a new proposed framework designed to shift the focus from costs to long term value, and ultimately deliver better retirement savings. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Pensions Regulator (TPR) aim to implement a joint framework for workplace defined contribution schemes.</p>
<p align="left">The joint framework would be used by pension providers and those making decisions on behalf of savers to provide greater transparency over how schemes are performing.</p>
<p align="left">Schemes will be compared on public metrics that demonstrate value &ndash; not just costs and charges, but also investment performance, and service quality. They would, once the final framework is decided, be publicly rated red, amber or green.</p>
<p align="left">Poorly performing schemes will be required to improve or ultimately protect savers by transferring them to better schemes. This should lead to better value pensions, without savers themselves having to take action.</p>
<p align="left">The proposals will also support the FCA&rsquo;s secondary growth and competitiveness objective. Focusing on value rather than costs will enable providers to invest in assets which could deliver greater long-term returns but have higher management costs, such as infrastructure or venture capital.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Markets and International at the FCA</strong>, said:</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;16 million people save for their retirement into defined contribution pension schemes. We&rsquo;re working with the government and the Pensions Regulator to help them get better returns.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We want to see a focus on long-term value, not just costs and charges. Given the impact these changes could have we are consulting now to ensure that the pension system can be ready to go when the legislative changes that need to happen are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Emma Reynolds MP, Minister for Pensions</strong>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Last year, over &pound;130 billion was saved into workplace pension schemes &ndash; money which we want to see working hard for future pensioners to give them better retirement incomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Our Pension Bill and Pensions Review will make pensions fit for the future, and having an effective Value for Money framework will lay the foundations for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"I would encourage responses from across the industry, including trust-based schemes, to this consultation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

India's VC landscape in H1 2024 sees 45.3% increase in funding value, with larger investments and declining deal volume. India ranks high globally.<br />
Investors' confidence in Indian startups<br />
572 VC deals worth $5.6 billion in H1 2024<br />
India accounts for 7% global VC deals, 4.4% funding value<br />
Summary: India's VC landscape in H1 2024 reflects larger investments, declining deal volume, and growing global standing, indicating confidence in Indian startups. <div>
<p><span><span>India&rsquo;s venture capital (VC) landscape during the first half (H1) of 2024 highlights a strategic shift towards relatively larger investments, as reflected by the 45.3% increase in disclosed funding value year-on-year (YoY) despite a 2.1% drop in deal volume. This trend signifies investors&rsquo; growing confidence in high-potential startups, with significant deals like Zepto&rsquo;s $665 million and Meesho&rsquo;s $300 million fundraisings pointing to a robust future for the Indian startup ecosystem, says&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.b00YhNV2Nr0-2BaZn7eVNAdXV19MDZH7kb0yQVOf6WtC8eObQvQmU18OGm4LpUDS-2BPjOqK_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7C3K7RHp5Gm5XPA4ohOQ9tAuGjMYZPJBg8hgZ6p1U8S2f8AYJJJhbVbcQAPDEXY5yyigHMydLCriGxP6JYurFEC51QJuUIuipw5rPDWc7I7VOSHeYH-2BBiiQ7CjUBRhbTP48sckB2M280h-2FchqsuiATg-2FM-2FrT23GpBAOXlKr2c3TOiufKjlSUH0GvLKggUORRlK-2FzCwFlwVQdp94zZWnU2mCqANgo-2BBrjwl-2BHhoMhX5b78-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The massive jump in VC funding value despite a decline in deal volume can be seen as an indicator of improving investors&rsquo; appetite for big investments while also adopting a cautious approach. This can also be understood from the fact that the average size of VC deals increased from $6.5 million in H1 2023 to $9.7 million in H1 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in India during H1 2024 include $665 million worth of funding raised by Zepto, $300 million raised by Meesho, $216 million raised by PharmEasy, $150 million raised by Radiance, and $148 million raised by Kogta Financia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose adds: &ldquo;India, apart from being a leading APAC market for VC funding activity and standing just next to China in terms of both deals volume as well as value, is also among the top five markets globally.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>India accounted for 7% share of the total number of VC funding deals announced globally during H1 2024 while its share of the corresponding disclosed funding value stood at 4.4%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;As investors continue to pour substantial funding into promising startups, it underscores the improving confidence in India&rsquo;s market potential. This not only bolsters the country&rsquo;s standing in the global VC landscape but also sets the stage for a vibrant and resilient startup ecosystem poised for dynamic growth in the coming years.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<div> Derivatives, Volume, Growth, SDAV, STI
Summary:<br />Derivatives volume rose 15% y-o-y. FX futures reached record volume. New interest-rate hedging tools introduced. Commodities and equity derivatives also gained. SDAV and STI outpaced peers. Mainboard listing welcomed. <div>
<ul type="square">
<li><span>Derivatives volume rises as global investors turn to our marketplaces to manage risk amid heightened volatility</span></li>
<li><span>SDAV growth and STI outpace peers across Southeast Asia</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for July 2024. Activity in SGX Group&rsquo;s marketplaces increased across asset classes as global investors managed portfolio risks in response to manifold economic and political developments during a volatile month. Derivatives traded volume gained 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 23.5 million contracts.</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, SGX Group&rsquo;s Japan-access derivatives suite enabled market participants to manage risk around Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions. As the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate and announced plans to slow its monthly bond purchases, the volume of SGX three-month Tokyo Overnight Average (TONA) Futures topped 532 lots following the contract&rsquo;s debut on 29 July, while month-end open interest (OI) in SGX Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures rose 21% month-on-month (m-o-m). In addition, the pioneering SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures saw 52,504 lots (US$6.8 billion notional) traded on 31 July &ndash; up 36% over the daily average for the month.</p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Record FX futures volume:&nbsp;</span>total futures traded volume on SGX FX climbed 44% y-o-y in July to 4.8 million contracts, an all-time high. Gains were led by SGX USD/CNH FX Futures &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most widely traded international renminbi futures &ndash; with volume up 40% y-o-y at a record 2.9 million contracts, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 48% y-o-y to 1.6 million contracts. Anticipation of rate decisions by the BOJ and the Federal Reserve, as well as uncertainties over the U.S. presidential elections, fuelled volatility and bolstered portfolio hedging.</li>
<li><span>New interest-rate hedging tools with focus on central banks:&nbsp;</span>SGX Fixed Income&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20240312-sgx-group-launch-interest-rate-derivatives-2h-2024">launched</a>&nbsp;three-month TONA and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) Futures on 29 July, as investors seek more accessible and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. The contracts build upon SGX&rsquo;s offering of long-term interest rate futures comprising 10-year Full-Sized and Mini JGB futures.</li>
<li><span>Broad-based commodities gains, with record dairy OI:</span>&nbsp;Commodity derivatives traded volume rose 20% y-o-y in July to 5.1 million contracts, with bellwether iron ore derivatives volume up 22% y-o-y on elevated risk management amid diverse views on China&rsquo;s growth outlook. Over the first seven months of 2024, 13.3 million metric tonnes (MT) of petrochemicals derivatives have traded on SGX Commodities, close to the 13.4 million MT cleared in all of 2023. Dairy derivatives OI set a single-day record of 171,335 lots on 16 July, rounding off the month with a record average of 106,386 lots.</li>
<li><span>Highest SIMSCI OI notional value in more than four years:</span>&nbsp;OI in SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures rose 42% y-o-y in July to 221,551 lots, with notional value surpassing US$5 billion for the first time since January 2020 amid strong buyside interest in safe-haven markets. SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures volume gained 15% y-o-y, as overnight volumes climbed to a peak of 53,029 lots (US$4.1 billion notional) on 18 July following the release of chipmaker TSMC&rsquo;s earnings. On SGX Equity Derivatives, total equity index futures volume increased 5% y-o-y to 13.1 million contracts.</li>
<li><span>SDAV growth leads region:</span>&nbsp;Securities daily average value (SDAV) rose 13% y-o-y and 4% m-o-m in July to S$1.2 billion against declines across Southeast Asia, with higher retail activity across stock segments. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 3.7% m-o-m to 3,455.94, also outpacing peers across ASEAN and Developed Asia, with year-to-date returns of 6.7%. During the month, Singapore&rsquo;s stock market remained the second most-actively traded in Southeast Asia. Total securities market turnover value increased 23% y-o-y and 26% m-o-m to S$26.5 billion.</li>
<li><span>Record REIT ETF turnover:</span>&nbsp;The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) jumped 48% m-o-m in July to S$404 million. For real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, active participation from retail and robo-advisors lifted trading to a record S$131 million. Turnover of daily leverage certificates (DLC) surged 36% m-o-m to S$219 million, with Singapore-underlying DLCs showing the most increases.</li>
<li><span>Mainboard listing:&nbsp;</span>SGX Securities welcomed the secondary listing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20240719-sgx-securities-welcomes-helens-international-holdings-company">Helens International Holdings Company Limited</a>&nbsp;on Mainboard on 19 July. The company runs one of the largest bar chain networks in the PRC.</li>

<p><em>* Adjusted EBITDA, NPAT and EPS exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring items that have less bearing on SGX Group&rsquo;s operating performance.

<p><em>All figures are for the year except for figures in brackets, which are for the year earlier unless otherwise stated. Figures&nbsp;may be subject to rounding.</em></p>
<p><em>The presentation of revenue has been revised in FY2024 to the following four operating segments &ndash; Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities; Equities &ndash; Cash; Equities &ndash; Derivatives; and Platform and Others. FY2023 revenue has been reclassified to the four operating segments for a like-for-like comparison against FY2024</em><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1"><em><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today reported FY2024 adjusted net profit of S$525.9 million, 4.5% higher from the previous year (S$503.2 million).&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA was up at S$711.6 million (S$688.6 million), while adjusted earnings per share was 49.2 cents (47.1 cents).</p>
<p>Revenue increased 3.1% to S$1,231.7 million (S$1,194.4 million), mainly driven by higher revenues from Currencies and Commodities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;and Platform and Others, partially offset by lower Equities &ndash; Cash<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Equities &ndash; Derivatives<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has proposed a final quarterly dividend of 9.0 cents (8.5 cents) per share, payable on 25 October 2024, for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. If approved, this represents an annualised increase of 5.9%.</p>
<p>Loh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, &ldquo;Our multi-asset strategy has yielded positive results over the years and will remain our core differentiator. Revenue growth in FY2024 was led by strong volumes in our currencies and commodities businesses as we expanded our customer base and drove higher activity. Our currencies and commodities franchises are on a healthy growth momentum with volumes doubling over the last three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our equities businesses showed stronger activity in the second half of the financial year, with equity derivatives daily average volume and securities daily average value increasing 11% and 21% half-on-half respectively. We are pushing ahead with our efforts to increase market participation, product development and adoption, as well as cross-border connectivity.&nbsp; At the same time, we will work closely with the Review Group set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore,&rdquo; added Mr. Loh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) segment has delivered more than 20% CAGR in the last three years<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn3">[3]</a>. Commodities daily average volume (DAV) grew 50% to about 240,000 contracts in FY2024, driven mainly by broadening participation in our iron ore futures contracts during the overnight T+1 session. Looking ahead, the next phase of growth for commodities will be anchored on synergies between our ferrous and freight offering.</p>
<p>Our OTC FX average daily volume well surpassed our target with a 47% increase to reach US$111 billion in FY2024, while our currency futures DAV grew 36% to about 204,000 contracts. Our OTC FX business is projected to contribute mid-to-high single digit percent of Group EBITDA in the medium term, compared to around 3% of Group EBITDA in FY2024.</p>
<p>In the medium term, we aim to grow Group revenue (excluding treasury income) between 6-8% CAGR. This will be driven mainly by low to mid-teens percentage growth in our OTC FX and exchange traded derivatives businesses. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage as group expense growth<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;is expected to be in the low to mid-single digit percentage CAGR in the medium term.</p>
<p><span>Results Summary</span></p>

<p>FICC revenue increased 22.3% to S$322.5 million (S$263.6 million) and accounted for 26.2% (22.1%) of total revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue: S$137.1 million, up 1.0% from S$135.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>We recorded 7 (8) new equity listings which raised S$117.0 million (S$37.6 million). Secondary equity funds raised were S$1.2 billion (S$4.8 billion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securities daily average traded value (SDAV) declined&nbsp;3.9% to S$1.06 billion (S$1.10 billion) and total securities traded value declined&nbsp;4.2% to S$263.7 billion (S$275.5 billion). This was made up of Cash Equities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, where traded value decreased&nbsp;by 3.8% to S$253.2 billion (S$263.2 billion), and Other Products<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, where traded value&nbsp;decreased 13.9% to S$10.5 billion (S$12.2 billion). There were&nbsp;249 (250) trading days in FY2024.</p>
<p>Overall average clearing fees remained comparable at 2.49 basis points (bps) (2.49 bps). Turnover velocity (primary-listed) was 37.5% (37.4%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue was mainly&nbsp;due to higher interest income from handling of corporate actions, partially offset by lower number of settlement instructions.</p>
<p><span>Equities &ndash; Derivatives&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives revenue declined&nbsp;7.5% to S$334.0 million (S$361.3 million) and accounted for&nbsp;27.1% (30.2%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$256.1 million, down&nbsp;9.0% from S$281.6 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$77.9 million, down&nbsp;2.2% from S$79.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The decline in trading and clearing revenue was driven by a&nbsp;7.7% decline in total equity derivatives volumes, mainly from declines in volumes of our GIFT Nifty,&nbsp;<a>FTSE China A50&nbsp;</a>and Nikkei 225 index futures contracts, partially offset by higher volumes of our FTSE Taiwan index futures contracts. Excluding Nifty, trading and clearing revenue increased 0.5%.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Average Fees</span></p>
<p>Average fee per contract for Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives was 4.3% lower at S$1.54 (S$1.61) mainly driven by decline in average fee of our GIFT Nifty index futures contracts, due to the reclassification of NSE fee arrangement from expense to revenue as part of GIFT Connect. On a pro forma basis, FY2024 average fee per contract declined at a lower rate of 1.1% to S$1.54 (S$1.56).</p>
<p><span>Platform and Others&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Platform and Others revenue increased 5.6% to S$240.2 million (S$227.4 million) and accounted for&nbsp;19.5% (19.0%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Market data revenue: S$47.9 million, up&nbsp;9.0% from S$44.0 million</li>
<li>Connectivity revenue: S$77.2 million, up&nbsp;9.0% from S$70.8 million</li>
<li>Indices and other revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>: S$115.1 million, up&nbsp;2.2% from S$112.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in Market data revenue was mainly driven by repricing and increase in number of data licence subscribers<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in Connectivity revenue was mainly due to repricing and higher number of subscription of our co-location services.</p>
<p>Indices and other revenue increased mainly due to higher revenue contribution from Index Edge, Baltic Exchange and<em>&nbsp;</em>EMC, partially offset by decline in revenue from Scientific Beta.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Expenses Overview</span></p>
<p>Total expenses increased 3.4% to S$625.3 million (S$604.9 million), mainly from higher staff costs and one-time provision to fund initiatives targeted at improving the vibrancy of the Securities Market, offset by lower processing and royalties and professional fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusted total expenses increased 2.5% to S$604.0 million (S$589.3 million), excluding the one-time provision, amortisation of purchased intangible assets, and others.</p>
<p>We have been prudent in managing our cost base even as we invested for growth, particularly in the OTC FX business. Our Group expenses have grown in line with our medium-term guidance of mid-single digit percentage CAGR over the past three years.</p>
<p>We expect FY2025 expenses (excluding transaction-based expenses, i.e. processing and royalties) to grow 2-4% year-on-year. This will be achieved by measured pace of headcount growth, improving operational efficiency and realising savings from the completion of the migration of our OTC FX data centre.</p>
<p><span>Non-operating Items</span></p>
<p>Non-operating items were higher at S$117.1 million (S$99.8 million), driven largely by fair value gain from our investment in 7Ridge and higher net interest income, partially offset by higher impairment losses.</p>
<p><span>Capital Expenditure Overview</span></p>
<p>Total capital expenditure was S$66.0 million (S$59.4 million). These investments include modernisation of our technology infrastructure and consolidation of our office spaces.</p>
<p>FY2025 capital expenditure is expected to be S$70-75 million as we invest in the modernisation of our securities system and infrastructure upgrade. Beyond FY2025, capital expenditure is expected to further increase due to continued investments into the modernisation of our exchange trading and clearing platforms, and data centre. Over the next cycle, capital expenditure is anticipated to remain below the historical average of 7% of Group revenue.</p>

<p align="justify"><span>Webcast and Conference Call Information</span></p>
<p align="justify">Robinhood will host a conference call to discuss its results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today, August&nbsp;7, 2024. The live webcast of Robinhood's earnings conference call can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>, along with the earnings press release and accompanying slide presentation.</p>
<p align="justify">Following the call, a replay and transcript will also be available at the same website.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Financial Outlook</span></p>
<p align="justify">Our 2024 expense plan includes growth investments in new products, features, and international expansion while also getting more efficient in our existing businesses. Our outlook for both GAAP total operating expenses and Non-GAAP combined Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC for full-year 2024 is unchanged at $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion.</p>
<p align="justify">Actual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>

The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>
<p align="justify"><span><br />Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</span></p>
<p align="justify">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected financial performance of Robinhood Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;Robinhood,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and our strategic and operational plans, including (among others) statements regarding that with Robinhood Gold reaching 2 million subscribers, we&rsquo;re witnessing the flywheel accelerate; that we continue to focus on delivering another year of profitable growth; that management currently expects to execute a $1 billion share repurchase program over a two to three year period; that Robinhood will be hosting its first-ever customer-focused conference, happening October 16-18, 2024; and all statements and information under the headings &ldquo;Financial Outlook&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Outlook.&rdquo; Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;will&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;target,&rdquo; &ldquo;project,&rdquo; &ldquo;contemplate,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;predict,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential,&rdquo; or &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this press release. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our limited operating experience at our current scale; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of continued declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (&ldquo;PFOF&rdquo;), and the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations; the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies, and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and processes; the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes; the risk that our platforms and services could be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on August 8, 2024, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, all of which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">www.sec.gov</a>. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, August&nbsp;7, 2024 and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p>
<p align="justify">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss) and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo;), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.</p>
<p align="justify">The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA Margin</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income (loss) divided by total net revenues). We believe Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. We believe Adjusted Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves and (ii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC. We believe Adjusted Operating Expense and SBC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Key Performance Metrics</span></p>
<p align="justify">In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Funded Customers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Assets Under Custody (&ldquo;AUC&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets transferred out of our platforms (assets transferred in or out include debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and custodial crypto wallet transfers) for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Average Revenue Per User (&ldquo;ARPU&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this release represent ARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Gold Subscribers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Additional Operating Metrics</span></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Retirement AUC</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Retirement AUC as the total AUC in traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Cash Sweep</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total amount of participating users&rsquo; uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically &ldquo;swept&rdquo; or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Margin Book</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Notional Trading Volume</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Options Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Monthly Active Users ("MAU")</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define MAUs as the number of unique persons who, using one or more accounts with a Robinhood entity, meet one of the following criteria at any point during a specified calendar month: a) executes a debit card or credit card transaction, b) transitions between two different screens on a mobile device while logged into their account or c) loads a page in a web browser while logged into their account. A person need not satisfy these conditions on a recurring monthly basis or be a Funded Customer to be included in MAU. MAU figures in this release reflect MAU for the last month of the relevant period presented. We utilize MAU to measure how many customers interact with our products and services during a given month. MAU does not measure the frequency or duration of the interaction, but we consider it a useful indicator for engagement. Additionally, MAUs are positively correlated with, but are not indicative of, the performance of revenue and other key performance indicators.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Glossary Terms</span></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Investment Accounts</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account or a funded individual retirement account ("IRA"). As of June 30, 2024, a Funded Customer can have up to three Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">When used with respect to Net Deposits, &ldquo;growth rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;annualized growth rate&rdquo; provide information about Net Deposits relative to total AUC. &ldquo;Growth rate&rdquo; is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period. &ldquo;Annualized growth rate&rdquo; is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the immediately preceding quarter.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Results From Its First Fact Finding Exercise On Creditworthiness Assessment Practices Of Non-Bank Lenders</title>

<div> Report, creditworthiness assessment, non-bank lenders, EBA, consumer trends<br />
<br />
The EBA published a report on non-bank lenders' creditworthiness assessment practices, finding inadequate practices, lack of harmonization, and increased consumer credit. The EBA will continue monitoring NBL activities. <br /><br />Summary: The EBA report highlights inadequate creditworthiness assessment practices by non-bank lenders, lack of harmonization, increased consumer credit, and the need for ongoing monitoring. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the results of a fact finding exercise on the creditworthiness assessment (CWA) practices of non-bank lenders (NBLs). The exercise is a follow-up to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-identifies-fraud-retail-payments-and-over-indebtedness"><span>Consumer Trends Report</span></a><span>&nbsp;published in April 2023 and aimed at gaining insight into the extent to which NBLs contribute to over-indebtedness and arrears. The EBA finds that,&nbsp;while some NBLs might service segments of the population that may have limited opportunities to access traditional banks for credit, a significant number of the surveyed NBLs appear to apply inadequate practices for information gathering and verification during their CWAs.</span></p>
<p>The Report also finds that the lack of a harmonised definition of NBLs and a harmonised authorisation framework in the EU contribute to different types of NBLs being supervised in different ways across EU Member States. Consequently, different rules apply to entities that are of a similar kind across the EU.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Report finds that many National Competent Authorities have taken supervisory actions in respect of NBLs, but the surge in the number and significance of these entities increases the need for specialised resources dedicated to the monitoring of non-bank lending activities.</p>
<p>In terms of market trends, the Report shows that the proportion of credit granted under the Consumer Credit Directive by the surveyed NBLs between 2020 and 2023 overall increased, with a peak of 43% in 2021. In the same period, the proportion of loans granted under the Mortgage Credit Directive by the surveyed NBLs decreased from 58% to 45%.</p>
<p>The EBA will continue monitoring the activities of NBLs through its biennial Consumer Trends Report and may consider, depending on the findings and the need, initiating further ad hoc action to foster further protection of EU consumers.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>The EBA is mandated under Article 9 of its founding Regulation to, inter alia, collect, analyse, and report on consumer trends. To that end, the EBA publishes a biennial Consumer Trends Report, with several editions identifying indebtedness as one of the key issues that causes significant detriment to consumers in the EU, with the last edition indicating that NBLs and their CWA practices may play a significant role in contributing to this recurrent issue.</p>
<p>In order to gauge insight of the CWA practices applied by NBLs in respect to credit products falling under the Consumer Credit Directive and/or the Mortgage Credit Directive, the EBA carried out a fact finding exercise with National Competent Authorities that chose a sample of 125 NBLs from across the EU to include in the exercise, and using the reference period between 2020 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">TASE records adjusted profit of close to NIS 26 million in the second quarter, compared to NIS 20 million last year</span></p>
<div class="news-container ng-star-inserted">
<div class="rich-text">
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue in the second quarter of 2024 totals NIS 105.1 million, a 13% increase compared to NIS 92.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 totaled NIS 45.8 million, compared to NIS 35.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjusted net profit in the second quarter of 2024 totaled NIS 25.7 million, compared to NIS 20.4 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 26%.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ittai Ben Zeev, TASE CEO, said today:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;TASE continues to show resilience and support the Israeli economy against the backdrop of the ongoing war. We continue to push forward with technological innovation, implementing advanced infrastructure and promoting collaborations in order to upgrade the market, remove barriers and enhance its global accessibility. Now more than ever we are resolved to continue developing the capital market, as part of our unwavering commitment to the Israeli economy, which is pivotal to our national strength.</p>
<p>As part of these efforts, we recently published, in cooperation with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, a call for public comments on the proposal to align the TASE trading week with the global standard; a strong positive response was received in favor of changing to a Monday-through-Friday trading week. We are confident that this strategic move that will make TASE more readily accessible for global investors and increase their involvement in the Israeli capital market, benefiting the Israeli economy in general and the local companies in particular. We are currently examining all the public comments received in order to reach the most fitting solution, both for international investors and for the Israeli capital market."</p>
<p><strong>Tel Aviv, August 7, 2024 -&nbsp;</strong>The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE:&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Trading volumes rose significantly in the first half of the year with growth in indices and solid issuance activity</strong></p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, in the midst of the war, the TA-125 index increased by 3.5%, compared to the 3.8% for the Dow Jones index and compared 14.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index. Equity price rises characterized most sectoral indices, with the TA-Retail index leading the list with a 13% increase, followed by the high-tech companies&rsquo; indices - TA-Technology and TA-Global Bluetech, with a 10% and 9% increase, respectively, compared to the concurrent 17% increase in the NASDAQ 100 index. The market cap of the equity market at the end of the first half of the year reached NIS 1,087 billion, a 3% increase over 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Trading volumes in the main trading channels increased significantly in the first half of the year compared to 2023.</strong></p>
<p>In the equity market, trading volumes were 8% higher than the average daily trading volume for all of 2023, and averaged NIS 2.1 billion a day.</p>
<p>The average daily trading volume of bonds reached NIS 4.5 billion in the first half of the year, 15% higher than the average daily trading volume in the year 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the increase in the trading volume of the government shekel bonds, which totaled NIS 2.3 billion, compared to an average of NIS 1.9 billion in the previous year. CPI-linked government bonds also showed stronger trading volumes, at an average daily volume of NIS 1 billion, 1% greater than the average daily trading volume in the full year 2023. The trading volume of corporate bonds averaged NIS 1.1 billion, 12% greater than the average daily trading volume in the previous year.</p>
<p>T-bills also recorded substantial trading volumes in the first half of the year, at a daily average of NIS 1.7 billion, 19% higher than the average daily trading volume in 2023.</p>
<p>Creations and redemptions of mutual funds reached an average daily volume of NIS 1.8 billion, 28% greater than the average daily volume in the year 2023. The market cap of the mutual funds at the end of the first half of the year reached NIS 375 billion, 14% greater than the market cap at the end of 2023, this as a result of acquisitions of mutual funds and the appreciation of the mutual funds&rsquo; assets on TASE.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, 3 companies completed an IPO on TASE, compared to only one company in 2023.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the ongoing war and the growing deficit, the Ministry of Finance continued to raise debt in the second quarter of the year. The total amount of debt raised by the Ministry of Finance in bond offerings in the first half of the year totaled NIS 124.4 billion, compared to NIS 76.7 billion in the second half of 2023. NIS 95.7 billion of said amount was raised on TASE.</p>
<p><strong>Continued implementation of the strategic plan - alignment with global standards and diversification of investment products</strong></p>
<p>TASE continues to implement the strategic plan, with significant emphasis on the enhancement of global activity, the alignment of standards and the removal of trading barriers in the interfaces with the international markets.</p>
<p>Further to a call for public comments, published by TASE in collaboration with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, regarding the proposed transition to trading on Fridays as well, in line with the global standard, TASE announces that the proposed move received a very positive response from local and international investors, with a majority supporting a transition to a Monday through Friday trading week. TASE is currently considering options for the implementation of this alignment that would optimally benefit the local capital market and the international investors.</p>
<p>TASE continues to work in cooperation with the various authorities and regulators. Thus, for example, in mid-July, the Ministerial Legislation Committee approved the Securitization Law, which will facilitate, for the first time in Israel, the execution of securitization transactions, in alignment with global practices. Once the legislation is passed by the Knesset, TASE hopes to implement it and open the market already in 2025. In addition, the Israel Securities Authority has recently approved the launch of new money market funds with fixed dates, offering the public access to predetermined yield, this alongside the existing money market funds, allowing for greater product diversity for the benefit of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TASE continues to actively encourage new brokers to enter the Israeli capital market - since the end of May, Altshuler Shaham Trade is active as a member on TASE and TASE Clearing House, bringing the number of TASE members up to 25, compared to 24 at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>In addition, TASE continues to expand and diversify the range of products and to invest, among others, in new exclusive indices, this as part of its strategy of developing and upgrading the market, especially with the public in mind. In June, for the first time, TASE launched new indices with Kesem, Israel&rsquo;s largest fund company. In mid-July, TASE announced the launch of 7 additional equity and bond indices, some of which are designated for further collaborations between TASE and the various product issuers.</p>
<p>In the derivatives market, at the beginning of June, TASE reduced the multipliers of options on the TA-35 index, the TA-Banks5 index and the TA-125 index, as well as those of the foreign exchange derivatives traded on TASE. Part of the sources that will derive from the reduction of the underlying assets&rsquo; multipliers will be allocated to the development of the market and the enhancement of liquidity in the derivatives&rsquo; market by way of a volume rebate program.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights of the results for the second quarter and the first half of 2024:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revenue in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 105.1 million, compared to revenue of NIS 92.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 13%. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees. The most significant revenue item - trading and clearing commissions - totaled NIS 38.8 million in the second quarter of the year, compared to NIS 35.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year. 15% of the increase in revenue from trading and clearing commissions is due to an increase in the trading volumes and in the volume of creations/redemptions of mutual fund units. In opposition, a reduction in the effective commission rate in revenue from mutual funds and T-bills reduced the aforesaid increase in revenue by 4%, and there being one less trading day in the current quarter reduced revenue by an additional 2%.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 74.8 million, compared to costs of NIS 72.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 3% increase. The higher costs are due mainly to the increase in payroll expenses and technological investments and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 2 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 3.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 45% decrease. Financing income in the quarter increased due to interest income on the deposits. At the same time, financing expenses also increased as a result of a bank loan obtained at the end of 2023, resulting in reduced net financing income.</p>
<p><strong>Tax expenses, net in the second quarter of 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 8 million, compared to NIS 5.2 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The increase in the tax expense stemmed from the higher pre-tax profit. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to losses on securities in previous years for which deferred taxes were not created.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 24.3 million, compared to NIS 18.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%. The increase in profit was due mainly to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 45.8 million, compared to NIS 35.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%. Most of the increase is due to the NIS 10 million increase in profit before financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 25.7 million, compared to NIS 20.4 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 26%. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights of the results for the first half of 2024:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revenue in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 213.4 million, compared to revenue of NIS 192.9 million in the corresponding period last year, an 11% increase. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 150.1 million, compared to costs of NIS 142.6 million in the corresponding period last year, a 5% increase. The higher costs are due mainly to the increase in payroll expenses and technological investments and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 3.4 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 6.1 million in the corresponding period last year, a 44% decrease. Financing income in the period increased due to interest income on the deposits. At the same time, financing expenses also increased as a result of a bank loan obtained at the end of 2023, resulting in reduced net financing income.</p>
<p><strong>Net tax expense in the first half of 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 16.7 million, compared to NIS 12.2 million in the corresponding period last year, a 37% increase. The increase in the tax expense stemmed from the higher pre-tax profit. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to losses on securities in previous years for which deferred taxes were not created.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 50 million, compared to NIS 44.3 million in the corresponding period last year, a 13% increase. Most of the increase in profit was due to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 94.4 million, compared to NIS 79.1 million in the corresponding period last year, a 19% increase. The increase is due to an increase of NIS 12.9 million in profit before financing, eliminating share-based payment expenses and depreciation expenses in an amount of NIS 2.4 million.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 53.5 million, compared to NIS 46.5 million in the corresponding period last year, a 15% increase. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses and the adjustment of the increase in costs with respect to share-based payments.</p>

<div> unanimously, inadmissible, appeal, investigation, decision
Summary: The Board unanimously found Euroins' appeal inadmissible, stating that EIOPA's power to investigate is discretionary and not subject to review. The publication of the decision was postponed. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="node__content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Joint Board of Appeal (&ldquo;The Board&rdquo;) of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the EBA, ESMA, EIOPA), unanimously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-08/BoA_-_Euroins_v_EIOPA_-_combined_decision_and_orders.pdf">decided&nbsp;</a>that the appeal brought by Euroins Insurance Group AD (&ldquo;Euroins&rdquo;) against the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is inadmissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The appeal was brought in relation to the EIOPA Chairperson&rsquo;s decision not to start an investigation into an alleged breach or non-application of Union law regarding the withdrawal of the license of a subsidiary insurance undertaking of Euroins by the national competent authority in Romania.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its decision, the Board finds that EIOPA&rsquo;s power to initiate an investigation is of an entirely discretionary nature. Furthermore, the Board also asserts that the EIOPA Chairperson&rsquo;s decision to initiate an investigation is not subject to the Board&rsquo;s review. Finally, the decision clarifies that the Board does not have the power to order EIOPA to re-assess an appellant&rsquo;s request to open an investigation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Following the adoption of the decision, two orders on its publication were also adopted. The first order dismissed Euroins&rsquo; request not to publish the decision and its request for redaction. Yet, it agreed to delay publication to a date allowing Euroins to file an appeal against that order the General Court. The second order came upon request from the President of the Court of First Instance, seeking to grant additional time to analyse the case and consider interim measures requested by Euroins. That second order postponed the publication of the decision until 7 August 2024.</p>

<div> MoU, supervision, financial market infrastructure, coordination, regulatory sandboxes
Summary:
The Bank of England and FCA co-operate to supervise financial market infrastructure, with an effective MoU and plans for updates and new areas of coordination. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<h4>Statement</h4>
<div class="content-block">
<div class="page-content page-carousel sc-undefined" id="content">
<div id="output">
<p>The Bank of England (Bank) co-operates with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (&lsquo;The Authorities&rsquo;), to supervise financial market infrastructure (FMI).</p>
<p>A memorandum of understanding (MoU)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/august/boe-and-fca-mou-on-supervision-of-financial-market-infrastructures#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;facilitates effective supervision and policy making by the authorities. The MoU allows for the exchange of information between the authorities and promotes efficiency by minimising duplication of regulatory activities regarding FMIs. The MoU must be reviewed annually<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/august/boe-and-fca-mou-on-supervision-of-financial-market-infrastructures#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;to ensure it is proving effective. This involves requesting feedback from supervised FMIs on whether the proposed co-operation is working effectively.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA held a consultation with FMIs: Central Counterparties (CCPs), Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) and Recognised Central Securities Depositories (RCSDs) based on these firms&rsquo; interaction in 2023.</p>
<p>Respondents agreed that the arrangements of the MoU are proving to be effective and emphasised the importance of close and effective coordination between the authorities. They acknowledged the efforts made on coordination and agree that the Bank and FCA remain committed to effective co-operation. One noted feedback submitted last year had been acted upon. Respondents also highlighted increased communication and coordination between the respective supervisory teams relating to topics such as operational resilience.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA agree that the arrangements of the MoU regarding co-operation continue to be effective with appropriate coordination and no material duplication between them. The Bank and FCA will seek to address any specific areas identified by firms, including the need for collaboration in relation to new rulemaking powers.</p>
<p>The MoU will be updated in 2024 to reflect changes related to the Financial Services Markets Act (2023), as well as new areas requiring coordination, including regulatory sandboxes, in which innovations can be safely tested, and policy initiatives.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA are also agreeing a separate MoU setting out how they intend to co-operate with each other in relation to the operation and supervision of the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS). This DSS MoU will be published before supervision in the DSS commences.</p>

<div> Options, VIX futures, Cboe, trading, volatility
<br />
Cboe plans to launch options on VIX futures, addressing global demand for hedging tools. Options will complement existing VIX Index options. Users can hedge positions using front-month VIX futures and standard VIX Index options.
<br /><br />Summary: Cboe announced plans to launch options on VIX futures, expanding its VIX complex to address global demand for hedging tools. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>New options planned to be listed on front-month Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures</li>
<li>Options-on-future structure designed to offer new way to manage market volatility</li>
<li>Expansion of VIX complex aims to address global demand for hedging tools</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch options on Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures. The new options on VIX futures (VX) are expected to begin trading on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) on October 14, subject to regulatory review.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Cboe currently offers securities-based VIX Index options, which allow investors to manage or gain exposure to broad U.S. equity market volatility. &nbsp;The new options on VIX futures will provide similar utility but are based on front-month VIX futures. &nbsp;With futures as the underlying asset, these options will be CFTC-regulated, enabling a wide array of market participants that are restricted from accessing U.S. securities-based options to use this product to express their views on equity market volatility.</p>
<p>"As the pioneer in volatility trading, Cboe continues to expand its VIX complex with additional products and services targeted at helping market participants better manage portfolio risk and trade volatility," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Given the increased trading activity we're seeing in VIX options and the strong demand for hedging tools this year, we're especially excited to expand our volatility toolkit to include these new options on VIX futures and our planned relaunch of variance futures coming in late September. With the U.S. election quickly approaching, which has historically been a meaningful volatility catalyst for markets, we expect these tools will help meet customer demand to effectively manage risk."</p>
<p>"We expect options on VIX futures will complement our existing product suite, appealing to a broad group of users, including Commodity Trading Advisors, customers of Futures Commission Merchants, and market participants currently active in VIX exchange-traded products and in Cboe's SPX option and VIX product ecosystems," said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe. "By listing these options on Cboe's U.S. futures exchange, CFE's global network of FCMs and brokers can trade them using the same connections and memberships already established for trading VIX futures, thereby enhancing ease and accessibility."</p>
<p>Options on VIX futures will be European-style (can only be exercised at expiration) and will physically settle into front-month VIX futures. The new options are expected to complement the existing VIX Index options, providing customers with more choice in expiration dates and enabling more granular hedging strategies. Users of options on VIX futures may be able to hedge those positions using front-month VIX futures and standard VIX Index options.</p>
<p>The new options on VIX futures will be exclusively listed and traded on CFE, joining other prominent volatility products, such as Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures and the planned launches of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures and Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX) futures, subject to regulatory review.

<title>DTCC’s Insurance &amp; Retirement Services Launch Standardized “Can-Sell” API Messaging Application - Producer Authorization Provides NSCC Members The Capability To Confirm The Credentials Of Producers Instantaneously By Moving Straight From Distributor To Carrier</title>

<div> DTCC, Insurance & Retirement Services, Producer Authorization, real-time, standardized<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches PAR service, verifying producers' authorization in real-time, streamlining processes, leveraging ACORD NGDS, offering increased standardization. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of DTCC&rsquo;s Insurance &amp; Retirement Services&rsquo; (I&amp;RS) Producer Authorization (PAR) service, a standardized method for insurance vendors and distributors to communicate with carriers to verify producers' authorization that is mandatory to sell insurance products. PAR deploys synchronous messages, allowing distributors and vendors to ping carriers instantly to certify producer credentials, streamlining processes and increasing operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>Today, financial advisors are required by regulation to be properly licensed, appointed and trained to solicit and sell insurance products. PAR helps to standardize and automate this process by enabling distributors to properly validate producers&rsquo; credentials and qualifications in real time in order to understand whether individuals are permissioned to sell certain products in specific jurisdictions. This eliminates the need for firms to adopt and manage multiple proprietary processes and provides producers with the ability to proactively take corrective actions and lower Not in Good Order application submissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an industry need for a unified service, that provides real-time producer data, and we are pleased to now offer PAR,&rdquo; said Justin Schwartz, Executive Director, Product Management for Wealth Management Services at DTCC. &ldquo;In the development of the offering, we focused on building out a standardized &lsquo;can sell&rsquo; API message platform that improves client and advisor experience by providing increased confidence in authorized producers. We look forward to continuing to enhance our services to best meet the evolving needs of our clients and the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PAR leverages the ACORD Next-Generation Digital Standards (NGDS) UC-251 &ldquo;Verify Producer Can Sell Annuities&rdquo; User Story, providing enhanced licensing, appointments and training credentials that permits distributors to submit carrier message requests while simultaneously allowing carriers to determine if producers are authorized to advance new business applications. PAR can be utilized at any point during the solicitation/sales process, and the message statuses are readily available via API.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a need for a new insurance industry standard around real-time authorizations. This innovative solution has facilitated increased standardization in our messaging capabilities by streamlining processes which allows us to confirm a producers&rsquo; ability to sell a product for multiple carriers by accessing a single data point. We are excited to offer this service to our partners,&rdquo; said Doug Massey, EVP Sales at Hexure.</p>

<br />
H2O breached FCA regulations, failed due diligence on high-risk investments, did not declare conflicts of interest, provided false information, pays €250 million to affected investors.
<br /><br />Summary: H2O failed to comply with FCA regulations, resulting in a €250 million payment to affected investors. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Asset manager H2O AM LLP (H2O) will pay &euro;250 million to investors unable to access their funds since 2020, following an investigation by the FCA.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>Between April 2015 and November 2019, H2O failed to carry out proper due diligence on investments relating to the Tennor Group of companies owned by Lars Windhorst, or other companies he introduced.</span></p>
<p><span>The investments were high risk and hard to sell.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA also found that H2O did not have adequate policies or procedures or exercise due skill and care in managing potential conflicts of interest. The FCA identified over 50 instances where hospitality had been received by H2O employees but was not properly declared, including the use of a superyacht and private jet.</span></p>
<p><span>H2O also provided false and misleading statements and documentation to the regulator, such as fabricated records and minutes of meetings.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA would have imposed a substantial fine on H2O for its serious breaches. However, the FCA has agreed the firm will make &euro;250 million available to all those whose investments remain trapped. A significant part of this sum has been made available by way of voluntary contribution from the H2O Group. H2O has waived its rights to fees and investments totalling &euro;320 million and will apply to cancel its UK authorisation by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'H2O&rsquo;s job was to manage its funds properly and protect investors. It failed to do this and, to make matters worse, it repeatedly provided misleading information to the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>'Through this settlement the FCA has secured money for affected investors and agreement that H2O will stop operating regulated business in the UK.'</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read the FCA's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/h2o-am-llp-2024.pdf" title="h2o-am-llp-2024.pdf">Final Notice for H2O AM LLP</a>.</li>
<li>The French financial services regulator the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) is the designated regulator in respect of the collective investments, which H2O managed on a cross-border basis pursuant to the UCITS Directive, and the FCA is the designated regulator of H2O.</li>
<li>Were it not for the payment of &euro;250 million to affected investors and the fact that the AMF has previously issued a penalty on H2O (currently subject to appeal) in relation to the same investments, the FCA would have issued H2O with a penalty.</li>
<li>The FCA investigation found that H2O breached Principle 2 (skill, care and diligence), Principle 3 (management and control) and Principle 11 (relations with regulators) of its principles for business.</li>

<div> upgrades, latencies, Europe, Asia, trading
<br />
Avelacom has upgraded its core network to reduce latencies between European and East Asian trading hubs, providing faster connectivity for algorithmic trading strategies.
<br /><br />Summary: Avelacom upgrades network to reduce latencies between Europe and Asia, supporting increased trading volumes with faster connectivity. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Avelacom&rsquo;s core network has recently undergone significant upgrades, optimizing its terrestrial path latencies by up to 8 milliseconds.</span> </li>
<li><span>This benefits key routes between Europe&rsquo;s hubs (London, Frankfurt, Dublin, Zurich) and major East Asian hubs (Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong).</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Avelacom has reduced network latencies between European markets and major East Asian cities Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.&nbsp;</span><span>For example, the latency for the London &lt;&gt; Shanghai route is now less than 125 milliseconds (round-trip delay), compared to the previous industry benchmark of approximately 133 milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span>These unmatched speeds were achieved through network upgrades that were completed using cutting-edge technologies on these long-distance and complex routes, which travel through multiple countries.</span></p>

<title>SET Market  Report For July 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2024/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Federal Reserve, interest rate, market turbulence, Thai shares, economic recovery
<br /><br />Summary: The Federal Reserve kept interest rate unchanged, market turbulence caused sell-off, Thai shares saw slower foreign selling, Thai economic recovery gaining speed, TFEX trading volume declined. <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve (Fed) kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50 percent for the eighth consecutive meeting in July, as widely expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the US central bank will pivot in September&rsquo;s meeting. However, weak job reports in July, released after Fed&rsquo;s July meeting, led the market to perceive that September&rsquo;s potential rate cut could be a slow-footed response from the Fed. This triggered a global stock market sell-off led by Wall Street and Japan. Amid the market turbulence, investors are recommended to accumulate stocks with appropriate valuation and limited exposure to the potential impacts of recession. Signs of capital inflows to the regional stock market have emerged.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that foreign investors were still net sellers of Thai shares in July but at a slower pace as the Thai baht strengthened against the greenback throughout the month. The firmer baht was primarily driven by the overall appreciation of Asian currencies, led by the Japanese yen, and bolstered by rising global gold prices amid heightened geopolitical risks. Foreign investors' net buying of Thai bonds also strengthened the baht. The Thai economic recovery is gaining speed, underpinned by exports, tourism, and higher government spending. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)&rsquo;s tightened measures on short selling have effectively curbed such activities, encouraging more domestic investment and counterbalancing foreign investment trends. Moreover, the Thai government approved more attractive tax benefits for investment in Thai ESG funds including an increase in tax-deductible amount and a shorter lock-up period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for July</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2024, SET Index rose 1.5 percent from the previous month but fell 6.7 percent from the end of 2023 to close at 1,320.86 points. Investors are awaiting a clearer picture of the government&rsquo;s economic stimulus measures and assessing the impact of market confidence-boosting measures implemented in July 2024. </li>
<li>For the seven months to July, industry groups that outpaced SET Index were Technology, Agro &amp; Food Industry, Consumer Products and Services.</li>
<li>For the January-to-July period, SET&rsquo;s and mai&rsquo;s average daily trading value declined 22.3 percent over the same period last year to THB 44.16 billion (approx. USD 1.25 billion) Foreign investors sold Thai shares with a net THB 117.56 billion over the period as their trading ratio remained the highest among other types of investors for 27 consecutive months.</li>
<li>In July 2024, two newly listed companies on SET were Foods Moment pcl (FM) and Chaosua Foods Industry pcl (CHAO), and a newly listed on mai was Nice Call pcl (NCP).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of July 2024 was 14.3 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 12.5 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 16.0 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 15.1 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of July 2024 was 3.53 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.17 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in July 2024 averaged 379,777 contracts, down 30.3 percent from the previous month largely due to the decline in trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first seven months of 2024. TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume dropped 20.1 percent over the same period last year to 436,537 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> - ASIC, legislative instruments, consultation, feedback, record-keeping obligations
Summary:
ASIC proposes extension of 3 legislative instruments for 5 years, invites feedback on their effectiveness, and outlines background on the instruments. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>ASIC proposes to extend the operation of three legislative instruments for a further five years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Order [<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/current/F2014L01237">CO 14/923</a>]&nbsp;<em>Record-keeping obligations for Australian financial services licensees when giving personal advice</em>,</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/current/F2021L01128">ASIC Corporations and Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Reportable Situations) Instrument 2021/716</a></em>, and&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/current/F2021L01364"><em>ASIC Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Prescribed Commonwealth Legislation) Instrument 2021/801</em></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC has assessed that these instruments, which are due to expire in October 2024, are operating efficiently and effectively, and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.</p>
<p>In extending operation of the instruments, ASIC will convert [CO 14/923] to the legislative instrument format and consolidate the relief in ASIC Instruments 2021/716 and 2021/801 into one instrument.</p>
<p><em>A consultation paper was not issued for this consultation.</em></p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>ASIC invites feedback on our proposal, including whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>the instruments are operating effectively and efficiently, and/or</li>
<li>whether any amendments are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders should send their submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by 5pm on 4 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders may choose to remain anonymous or use an alias when providing feedback. However, ASIC will not be able to contact stakeholders to discuss their feedback if it was submitted it in this manner.</p>
<p>Please note stakeholder feedback will not be treated as confidential unless stakeholders specifically request that we treat whole or part of it (such as any personal or financial information) as confidential.</p>
<p>Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/dealing-with-asic/privacy/asic-privacy-policy-complete/" title="ASIC Privacy Policy - complete">ASIC&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>&nbsp;for more information about how we handle personal information, rights to seek access to and correct personal information, and the right to complain about breaches of privacy by ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>[<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/current/F2014L01237">CO 14/923</a>] modifies the Corporations Act to insert a new section 912G that imposes specific record-keeping requirements when AFS licensees or their representatives (including advice providers) give personal advice to retail clients.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01128/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/716</a>&nbsp;modifies the Corporations Act to exclude certain forms of non-compliance from being deemed &lsquo;significant&rsquo; breaches of core obligations, about which AFS licensees and credit licensees must lodge breach reports under the Corporations Act. The instrument also extends the period in which AFS licensees and credit licensees may report certain breaches that relate to an earlier reported breach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01364/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/801</a>&nbsp;modifies the law to specify the other Commonwealth legislation that is a core obligation for the purposes of the National Credit Act. Credit licensees must report significant breaches of core obligations under the National Credit Act.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators And Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Expect Crypto Trading Platforms To Prioritize Applications For Investment Dealer Registration And CIRO Membership</title>

<div> Securities, Crypto trading platforms, Investment dealers, CIRO membership, Canadian securities law
<br />
CTPs in Canada must comply with securities laws, aim for registration as investment dealers, and CIRO membership. Investors should exercise caution when investing in crypto assets.
<br /><br />Summary: CTPs in Canada must comply with securities laws, aim for registration as investment dealers, and CIRO membership. Investors should exercise caution when investing in crypto assets. <div>
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) are reminding crypto trading platforms (CTPs) to ensure their operations comply with Canadian securities laws by prioritizing their applications for registration as investment dealers and membership with CIRO.</p>
<p>On March 29, 2021, the CSA and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (now CIRO) published<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2021/03/5952456-_-CSA-IIROC-Notice-21-329.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Staff Notice 21-329&nbsp;<em>Guidance for Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms: Compliance with Regulatory Requirements</em></a>, providing guidance on the securities law requirements that apply to CTPs.</p>
<p>In Canada, CTPs that facilitate trading in either a) crypto assets that are securities and/or derivatives or b) instruments or contracts, based on crypto assets, that are securities or derivatives, are expected to register as investment dealers and become members of CIRO, the regulatory body intended to oversee this type of activity.</p>
<p>As outlined in the staff notice, the CSA contemplated an interim approach, which allowed CTPs to operate as restricted dealers in an appropriately regulated environment for a time-limited period while working toward obtaining CIRO membership. CSA members expected CTPs to actively and diligently seek registration as investment dealers and membership with CIRO by the end of the time-limited period, which was generally expected to be two years.</p>
<p>Given the time that has passed, CSA members expect CTPs to have carefully reviewed and understood the requirements to become investment dealers and CIRO members, and be actively engaged with CIRO on their applications. Moving forward, CSA members do not intend to continue with the interim approach for time-limited restricted dealer registration for CTPs as described in the staff notice.</p>
<p>CTPs that have been working actively and diligently with CSA members to complete their registration should contact the CSA member that is their principal regulator to discuss whether time-limited registration as a restricted dealer is appropriate for the CTP.</p>
<p><strong>Applying for CIRO membership</strong></p>
<p>CIRO is committed to ensuring an efficient and thorough process to review CTPs&rsquo; applications for membership with CIRO. Guidance on applying for CIRO membership is available on CIRO.ca under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/becoming-dealer-member" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Becoming a Dealer Member</a>&nbsp;section. CTPs are encouraged to complete a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/176/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Readiness Questionnaire</a>&nbsp;to self-assess if they have the necessary infrastructure and capital in place to apply for membership.</p>
<p>CTPs must submit a completed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/191/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Membership Application Form</a>&nbsp;and all supporting materials to apply for CIRO membership. All membership applications undergo an extensive review by CIRO staff. Once satisfied that the CTP can comply with CIRO By-laws and Rules, CIRO staff will forward their recommendation to CIRO&rsquo;s Board of Directors for decision.</p>
<p>CIRO staff work closely with firms applying for membership and encourage applicants to contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MemberIntake@ciro.ca">MemberIntake@ciro.ca</a>&nbsp;to arrange for a pre-filing discussion with the CIRO team dedicated to managing membership applications and transactions.</p>
<p>We encourage all CTPs to consult their legal counsel about Canadian securities law and CIRO rules, and to contact their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principal regulator</a>&nbsp;or CIRO staff with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Investors interested in crypto assets</strong></p>
<p>Investing in crypto assets can be high risk. Before choosing to buy or sell crypto assets, the CSA urges investors to consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of CTPs</a>&nbsp;that are authorized to do business with Canadians.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada&rsquo;s debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians&rsquo; trust in financial regulation and the people managing their investments. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.ciro.ca</a>.</p>
<p>For investor inquiries, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact your local securities regulator</a>.</p>

<title>ACER Confirms That The Danish Emergency Gas Supply Tariffs Comply With The EU Network Code</title>

<div> methodology, compliance, non-protected consumers, emergency supply services, cost allocation
Summary:<br />ACER finds Danish emergency supply tariffs compliant but lacking transparency. Ex-ante tariff doesn't consider supply risks; ex-post compensation adjusts for actual interruptions. Recommended more detailed information. <div>
<p>Today, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTBVUGAldXUEwLAgZVHVZfVwQdU10GUxoFA1ZVVgNWAFUGUwIdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;on the Danish non-transmission tariffs proposed by Energinet, Denmark&rsquo;s Transmission System Operator (TSO). These tariffs cover the costs of Denmark&rsquo;s emergency supply services, such as filling gas storage and providing emergency gas supply to non-protected consumers.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCBFIHU1QAUkxbUlAAHVYPBVQdUw5UVxoMB1VRDFAFUwVXBgYdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposed methodology</a>&nbsp;includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ex-ante tariff, calculated using a postage stamp reference price methodology (RPM), which distributes emergency service costs equally among all non-protected consumers.</li>
<li>An ex-post compensation, which adjusts cost allocation after gas is delivered based on the actual gas volumes received by each non-protected consumer during an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span></p>
<p>ACER evaluated the compliance of the proposed methodology with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>) and notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ex-ante postage stamp tariff does not consider the varying risks of supply interruption among different non-protected customers.</li>
<li>Non-protected consumers receive equal protection for the first 72 hours after emergency measures begin. After this period, the risk of gas supply interruptions may depend on the remaining gas volumes.</li>
<li>Designing a cost-reflective ex-ante tariff is highly challenging due to information confidentiality and the uncertainty of supply emergencies.</li>
<li>In the event of a supply emergency, the ex-post compensation increases cost reflectivity by adjusting the initial tariff to reflect the actual level of interruption for each non-protected customer.</li>
<li>The consultation document lacks sufficient information on the functioning of the ex-post compensation mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACER concludes that the proposed non-transmission tariffs comply with the NC TAR and recommends the Danish regulatory authority to ensure greater transparency by providing more detailed information on the ex-post compensation mechanism in their next decision.</p>

<p>Bitcoin rebounded today, joined by significant gains in other cryptocurrencies, as concerns over interest rates continued to fuel market volatility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin has bounced back today as we see the wider cryptocurrency market back in the green." said Arthur Firstov, Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo, a leading payment infrastructure provider in the digital token space. "Nevertheless, a mood of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has now engulfed the digital token space. The still nascent asset class is at the mercy of the gyrations of global financial markets. The actions of the US&rsquo;s Federal Reserve &ndash; and whether it has been behind the curve on rate cuts &ndash; remain front and centre in the minds of traders. Cryptocurrency markets are likely to remain highly volatile amid frenetic trading in the days to come.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Improves Despite Financial Performance Concerns</title>

<div> improved, farmer sentiment, concerns, financial performance, farmland values
Summary:<br /><br />The farmer sentiment improved in July, with concerns about high input costs and lower crop prices. However, financial performance declined, impacting farmland value expectations. <div>
<p>Three broad-based measures of farmer sentiment improved in July as the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=2170705440&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;index rose 8 points to 113, the Index of Current Conditions increased by 10 points to 100, and the Index of Future Expectations at 119 was 7 points higher than a month earlier. Despite declines in corn and soybean prices from mid-June to mid-July &mdash; Eastern Corn Belt cash prices fell 11% and 5%, respectively &mdash; farmer sentiment improved in July. Responses to the individual questions attribute this positive shift to fewer respondents reporting worsened conditions compared to a year ago and a decrease in those expecting negative future outcomes. This month's Ag Economy Barometer survey was conducted from&nbsp;July 15-19, 2024.</p>
<p>The July survey showed that high input costs remained the biggest concern for 34% of farmers. Additionally, the risk of lower crop and livestock prices continues to worry producers, with 29% citing it as a top concern, up from 25% in June. Reflecting the signals from the&nbsp;Federal Reserve&nbsp;that interest rates have peaked, only 17% of respondents cited rising interest rates as a top concern, down from 23% last month.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 4 points in July to 81, 6 points lower than in&nbsp;July 2023. The decline in financial performance expectations reflected farmers' worries about weakening commodity prices and high input costs following improvements in the May and June indices. Although production costs for principal crops, including corn and soybeans, have decreased year over year, output prices have also fallen, raising the possibility of a cost-price squeeze for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;crop producers.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about farms' financial performance, the Farm Capital Investment Index rose 6 points in July to 38, though it remains weak, at 7 points lower than in&nbsp;July 2023. This improvement was due to a slight decrease in the number of producers who believe it's a bad time to make large investments, which dropped from 80% in June to 75% in July.</p>
<p>"Declines in crop prices point to lower producer incomes this year, so the increase in optimism was somewhat puzzling,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=1415570011&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=360616614&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "Fewer producers citing rising interest rates as a primary concern for the upcoming year corresponds with the modest improvement in their perspectives on capital investments, but respondents continue to express hesitancy to make large investments."</p>
<p>July saw a small improvement in the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index, rising to 118 from 115 in June. This was driven by more respondents expecting stable farmland values over the next year. At the same time, the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped 6 points from June to 146, with fewer farmers expecting values to rise over the next five years and more anticipating they will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>As nationwide discussions begin for the 2025 crop year's farmland leases, the July survey revealed that nearly three-fourths (72%) of crop farmer respondents expect cash rental rates to remain roughly the same as in 2024. Among the remaining respondents, views were nearly evenly divided, with 15% anticipating a rise in rates and 13% expecting a decline.</p>

<div> ICE, Two Harbors, Encompass, digital mortgage platform, direct-to-consumer recapture originations channel
Summary:<br />ICE's Encompass platform selected by Two Harbors for direct-to-consumer mortgage originations, providing streamlined workflows and borrower experience, part of ICE's full mortgage technology ecosystem. <div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Intercontinental Exchange</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>, Inc.</span>&nbsp;</a>(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that Two Harbors Investment Corp.(NYSE:TWO) (&ldquo;Two Harbors&rdquo;), an MSR + Agency RMBS real estate investment trust, has selected the Encompass&nbsp;<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;digital mortgage platform to support their new direct-to-consumer recapture originations channel. Part of ICE&rsquo;s end-to-end digital housing finance ecosystem, Encompass is the mortgage industry&rsquo;s leading digital platform for lenders to originate, service, sell and purchase loans faster &ndash; all from a single system of record.</p>
<p>Since acquiring RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC (&ldquo;RoundPoint&rdquo;) in 2023, Two Harbors has become the eighth largest servicer of conventional loans in the country. The decision to expand into mortgage loan originations is key to their strategy of retaining servicing customers when interest rates drop and borrowers begin to refinance their loans. After a thorough search, Two Harbors identified Encompass as their platform partner in their effort to build out a direct-to-consumer channel to streamline origination workflows and provide an exceptional borrower experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The built-in configurability and smooth implementation process with ICE meant that we were able to begin offering loans to our customers at RoundPoint within several months of our decision to go with Encompass,&rdquo; said Bill Greenberg, Two Harbors&rsquo; President and CEO. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to continue to take advantage of the additional capabilities and greater efficiencies within the integrated ICE technology ecosystem. When we consider the scope of what we can achieve together, the possibilities are exciting and will be beneficial to our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encompass is key to the ICE end-to-end mortgage technology ecosystem, which is digitizing the entire real estate and housing finance lifecycle to create a better experience for lenders, homeowners, and investors. ICE is committed to investing in new innovations that help companies drive operational efficiencies across their entire business with visibility and control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud that Two Harbors chose the Encompass digital lending platform as they strategically expand their mortgage offerings.&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s technology will help them better meet the needs of borrowers in this continuously evolving market. Two Harbors has been able to quickly deliver for their customers &ndash; a testament to our ongoing commitment to innovation that both helps mortgage companies operate more efficiently and delivers a better experience to the American homeowner.&rdquo;</p>

<div> electronic marketplaces, trading volume, government bond, credit derivatives, repo<br />
<br />Summary:
Tradeweb reported a significant increase in trading volumes across various asset classes, including government bonds, credit derivatives, and repo in July 2024. <div>
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of July 2024 of $40.5 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-july-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$40.5-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.82-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $1.82tn, an increase of 43.5 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<p>In July 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share of fully electronic U.S. high yield TRACE</li>
<li>ADV in global repurchase agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2024 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<h5>RATES  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 47.4% YoY to $206.1 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 16.5% YoY to $42.9bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond volumes were supported by growth across all client sectors. Increased adoption across a range of protocols and favorable market conditions contributed to the increase in volume. The addition of r8fin continues to contribute positively to wholesale volumes. Strong double-digit YoY growth in European government bonds and UK Gilts was supported by sustained volatility on the back of key political elections in Europe and the UK earlier in July, as well as a continued active primary market during the first half of the month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 17.6% YoY to $196.8bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Record July To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was driven by robust roll trading activity and significant participation from fast-money accounts. Specified pool trading volumes were up YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 38.9% YoY to $351.5bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 85.7% YoY to $671.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong volume in swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was driven by ongoing institutional client activity, strong tailwinds from global political uncertainties and a 23% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Central banks continued to contribute to increased volatility due to active discussions on rate movements. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for risk transfers especially in inflation swaps and non-G3 currencies. Emerging markets swap growth remained strong. July compression activity was lower than 2Q24.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>CREDIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 38.3% YoY to $6.7bn and European credit ADV was up 10.5% YoY to $2.1bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.8% and a record 9.1% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. European credit volumes continued to be led by strong client adoption of portfolio trading as well as increased client adoption of Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;, Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) and our unique dealer selection tool (SNAP IOI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 21.6% YoY to $363 million (mm).  
<ul>
<li>Volume growth outpaced the broader market, which was up approximately 11% YoY<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-july-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$40.5-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.82-trillion/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>, as Tradeweb institutional and retail volumes surpassed 20% YoY growth amidst robust issuance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 44.0% YoY to $10.8bn.&nbsp;  
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>EQUITIES  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was down 1.7% YoY to $8.0bn and European ETF ADV was up 9.3% YoY to $2.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>ETF market volumes continued to be muted as market volatility remained low. On Tradeweb, U.S. ETF institutional volumes were strong, while wholesale volumes were lower YoY. European ETF volumes increased as clients continued to embrace our automated rules-based trading protocol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>MONEY MARKETS  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 25.3% YoY to $621.8bn.  
<ul>
<li>Increased client activity on Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic repo trading platform drove record global repo activity. The combination of quantitative tightening, increased collateral supply, and current rates market activity shifted more assets from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s reverse repo facility to money markets. Retail money markets activity was strong as markets priced in less aggressive Fed rate cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>*All comparisons versus 2Q23 unless otherwise noted.</i></p>
<p>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategy and delivered solid financial results and continued expense and capital discipline. Our strong free cash flow generation model gives us the flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to investors. We repurchased $50 million in shares year-to-date, and our Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $200 million.</p>
<p>The international roll-out of X-Pro and the launch of the next phase of our high-touch strategy is expected to occur late in the third quarter and will include initial elements of AI dealer select functionality. Our announcement yesterday to connect our liquidity pools with ICE Bonds to drive greater efficiency and liquidity in the Municipal and corporate bond markets is a great example of how we are leveraging connectivity to drive future growth.</p>
<p>In summary, we made significant progress in executing our strategy in the second quarter, and we believe the strategic priorities we have established will drive increased market share and higher levels of revenue growth for shareholders in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bwmarginl1"><b>Credit Commission Revenue</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Total credit commission revenue of&nbsp;<b>$160.8</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<b>$33.2</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;in fixed-distribution fees) increased&nbsp;<b>$6.8</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;, or&nbsp;<b>4%</b>&nbsp;, compared to&nbsp;<b>$154.0</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<b>$35.3 million</b>&nbsp;in fixed-distribution fees) in the prior year. The increase in total credit commission revenue was driven principally by higher emerging markets, U.S. high-grade and Eurobonds commission revenue. Strong growth in these products was partially offset by lower U.S. high-yield commission revenue on lower credit spread volatility. The decline in variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$148.16</b>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<b>$157.42</b>&nbsp;in the prior year was mainly due to product and protocol mix-shift, principally lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The decrease in fixed-distribution fees was principally driven by the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1"><b>Credit Trading Volumes</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Strong growth in total credit average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$13.7 billion</b>&nbsp;, up&nbsp;<b>12%</b>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<b>Record $55.0 billion&nbsp;</b>in&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>total portfolio trading volume, up&nbsp;<b>143%</b>&nbsp;compared to the prior year, and up&nbsp;<b>24%&nbsp;</b>from 1Q24.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></li>

<p><b>Non-GAAP financial measures and other items</b></p>
<p>To supplement the Company&rsquo;s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;EBITDA&rdquo;), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company&rsquo;s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow.</p>
<p>Please refer to Tables 6 &amp; 7&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54104935&amp;newsitemid=20240805496841&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=3&amp;md5=4b97a1c3a45ecb76ff36d7ad40372915" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Due to variances in how portfolio trading market participants utilized the portfolio trading TRACE &ldquo;flag,&rdquo; the Company previously used its own internal methodology for calculating portfolio trading as an estimated percentage of TRACE volume and the Company&rsquo;s estimated market share. The Company is reviewing recent improvements in the TRACE data, but it now believes that the portfolio trading TRACE &ldquo;flag&rdquo; more accurately reflects the true size of the portfolio trading market. As such, at this time, the Company is not presenting portfolio trading as an estimated percentage of TRACE volume or the Company&rsquo;s portfolio trading estimated market share for the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, for periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54104935&amp;newsitemid=20240805496841&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=4&amp;md5=fdb98467f415a1036d1c3fbbabf6870f" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<title>Biotech IPO Raising Soars Sixfold QoQ in Q1 2024 Amid Renewed Investor Optimism, Reveals GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> IPOs, biotech, Q1 2024, GlobalData, investor optimism <br />
Summary:<br />
- IPOs in biotech surged in Q1 2024, indicating pent-up demand after a two-year decline. 
- Strong clinical data may encourage more biotech IPOs in late 2024.
- H1 2024 had six IPOs raising over $100 million each, renewing investor optimism. 
- Switzerland, the US, and India led in biotech IPO raises in 2024. 
- Updated rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange aim to boost London's position as a major financial hub. <div>
<p><span><span>Biotech initial public offerings (IPOs) surged in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, with eight completed IPOs raising $3.72 billion&mdash;six times the amount raised in Q4 2023 and marking the highest quarterly biotech IPO value in over a year on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) comparison. This increase followed a two-year decline, indicating pent-up demand. Going forward, robust clinical data may encourage more biotech companies to go public later in the year, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3D0nkm_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CIf5jHM7L0a7n2JNJKQ7GrH0rYmMXsallAnv-2FY6uIMOyda0I9tYCLLXtpZRvn2cCAnr7IMGWonNn0XH0-2FhcYm1-2FxsJkRM4Ylnias18noVNM5hIKw59THOL1ddjvVE52Y0ycKZFcz36lp9nqGIXeRmo3FVzXRiOILeRmhVvEy45968Usw8cJwPL5db8GohM9q5gxXK1Kiwt6Fjx9XNYsBCvh66YdD4-2FZ1m2n05DWPvTo0-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharmaceutical Intelligence Center, the surge in completed biotech IPO raising in Q1 2024 followed a two-year decline from $30.8 billion in 2020 to $5.9 billion in 2022 and $4.4 billion in 2023.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;High interest rates during 2022 and 2023 led investors to prioritize the existing portfolios over new opportunities, causing many biotechs to delay their IPOs until market conditions improved.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The increase in IPO value raised in Q1 2024 set a strong pace for the year, possibly reflecting the pent-up demand after a two-year slump. The first and largest biotech IPO to date was CG Oncology, raising $437 million for its armed oncolytic virus therapy, CG-0070.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan adds: &ldquo;Despite a decline in IPOs in Q2 2024, companies with strong clinical data that previously struggled to secure funding may now see early 2024 successes as an opportunity to pursue public offerings.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_.jpg" title="GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In H1 2024, six completed IPOs each raised over $100 million, totaling nearly $5 billion. This is more than double the $2.2 billion raised by five high-value IPOs in H1 2023. This surge, along with more venture funding, has renewed investor optimism. In 2024, biotech companies in Switzerland, the US and India led with the highest IPO raises, with $2.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $273 million, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority has recently updated the rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange. These changes are meant to make it easier for companies to go public and boost London&rsquo;s position as a major financial hub post-Brexit. The new rules aim to improve Britain&rsquo;s capital markets, attract more investment, and make London a strong competitor to financial hubs like New York and the EU.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;The growth in completed IPOs in the first half of 2024 marks a positive shift following a period of downturn. This reflects renewed investor optimism to create new opportunities for companies with strong clinical data. The success of IPOs in the first quarter may prompt more biotechs to go public in the latter half of the year, although investors remain cautious as market conditions stabilize.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Includes all completed IPO deals for companies headquartered globally from H1 2020&ndash;H1 2024. Includes deals where deal values are disclosed in the public domain.</span></span></span></p>

<div> director, promoter, manager, ban, breach <br />
Justice Robinson banned Wei Zhong and Regina Ding for 9 years for market manipulation and imposed penalties, emphasizing their lack of integrity and remorse. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Wei (Walker) Zhong and Lei (Regina) Ding have been banned from being a director, promoter or manager of an entity, as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct 2013 (FMC Act), for nine years, the High Court has ruled.</p>
<p>Mr Zhong was the Executive Chairman and CEO of Oceania Natural Limited; Ms Ding was a senior manager and marketing director of Oceania Natural Limited.</p>
<p>The pair were found to have breached the market manipulation and disclosure provisions under the FMC Act in April 2023. They received the highest penalties imposed to date for breaching the market manipulation provisions. Mr Zhong received a penalty of $1.3m and Ms Ding was ordered to pay $760,000.</p>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; sought banning orders for both Mr Zhong and Ms Ding and costs as part of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Justice Robinson awarded the FMA costs of approximately $468,000.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, welcomed the decision. She said: &ldquo;Banning orders are designed to protect the public from harm and hold egregious conduct, as was displayed in this case, to account. Senior managers of listed companies have a responsibility to act with integrity and trust, Mr Zhong and Ms Ding&rsquo;s conduct fell well short of what was expected of them. As Justice Robinson stated, Mr Zhong and Ms Ding&rsquo;s misconduct was flagrant and dishonest, and they showed a complete lack of remorse and contrition.&rdquo;</p>

<div> guidance, resolution plans, banks, Federal Reserve, submission deadline
Summary:
The Federal Reserve issued final guidance for certain large banks' resolution plans, setting a new submission deadline of October 1, 2025. The guidance addresses key areas of vulnerability and provides expectations for different resolution strategies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Monday issued final joint guidance to help certain large banks further develop their resolution plans. The final guidance is largely similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230829b.htm">proposed guidance</a>&nbsp;from August 2023 and incorporates changes in response to comments received. The Board developed the guidance jointly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and it is now final following both agencies' approval.</p>
<p>These resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure.</p>
<p>The guidance generally applies to domestic and foreign banks with more than $250 billion in total assets but that are not the largest and most complex banks, for which guidance is already in place. The guidance addresses the specific characteristics of, and risks posed by, this group of banks.</p>
<p>The guidance is organized around key areas of potential vulnerability, such as capital, liquidity, and operational capabilities that could be needed in resolution. Distinct from the guidance to the largest and most complex banks, this guidance provides agency expectations for both single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, which are different strategies banks have adopted for their rapid and orderly resolution. It also recognizes that the preferred resolution outcome for foreign banks is often a successful home country-led resolution and guides foreign banks on how to address the global resolution plan in their U.S. plan.</p>
<p>The agencies also announced that they are extending the resolution plan submission deadline for the banks to which the guidance applies. Banks will be required to submit their resolution plans by October 1, 2025, instead of March 31, 2025. The purpose of the extension is to provide reasonable time for banks to consider the final guidance as they develop their plan submissions.</p>

<h3>Release Dates&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Survey of up to eighty large domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.

<div> London, Thomas Ellis, Hakluyt, managing partner, global strategic advisory<br />
Summary:<br />
Thomas Ellis elected as managing partner at Hakluyt, with prior experience in the EMEA region and banking. Committed to leading the firm's future success. <div>
<p>Hakluyt, the global strategic advisory firm for businesses and investors, is delighted to announce that Thomas Ellis has been elected the firm's new managing partner.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg799bleft"><img align="middle" alt="Hakluyt announces election of Thomas Ellis as new managing partner" id="prnejpg799bleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2475585/Hakluyt_New_Managing_Partner.jpg" title="Hakluyt announces election of Thomas Ellis as new managing partner" /></div>
<p>Currently based in London, Tom joined Hakluyt eight years ago, and has served as the company's chief operating officer for the past two years. He previously led Hakluyt's client-facing business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, and before that ran the firm's office in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Prior to Hakluyt, he worked at Lloyds Banking Group, including as director of business banking, and as a civil servant in the UK Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>Lord Paul Deighton, Hakluyt's chairman, said: "Tom has been elected managing partner with strong support from across the Hakluyt partnership &ndash; so he has a clear mandate for his vision for the firm and plans for the future. I, along with the rest of the board, congratulate him and look forward to giving him our full support as Hakluyt enters its 30th year and continues to go from strength to strength.</p>
<p>"I should also like to record my thanks to Holly Morrow for doing an excellent job as acting managing partner since the departure last month of our previous managing partner, Varun Chandra, for a role in the UK government."</p>
<p>Tom added: "I am honoured to have been elected by my peers to lead Hakluyt as its new managing partner. After eight brilliant years with the firm, it is a privilege to have this opportunity to build on the excellent work of my predecessors and colleagues, and lead us into our next chapter.</p>
<p>"As the operating environment for business leaders around the world becomes ever more complex, demand for Hakluyt's advice and expertise continues to grow in all regions. It is my overriding goal to ensure that we continue to be as well placed as possible to help our clients succeed."</p>

<div> outages, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, recession, trading apps
Summary:<br />Online brokerages Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments experienced outages as investors offloaded risky assets amid recession fears, while Wall Street plummeted due to weak economic data. Robinhood Markets also resumed trading after a pause. <div>
<p>On Monday, online services at brokerages Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments experienced significant outages as many investors sought to offload risky assets amid fears of a potential U.S. recession.</p>
<p>Users reported difficulties logging into their accounts, a problem that the trading apps confirmed without further details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Charles Schwab site, a warning notice said, "Due to a technical issue, some clients may have difficulty logging in to Schwab platforms and may have difficulty reaching us by phone. Please accept our apologies as our teams work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Wall Street's main indexes plummeted, driven by weak economic data, disappointing second-quarter earnings from major technology firms, and rising geopolitical tensions, which reignited recession concerns and dampened hopes for a soft landing.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Robinhood Markets, a popular platform among retail investors, stated it had resumed overnight trading after a temporary pause.</p>

<div> revenue, securities, lending, global, equity <br />
Global securities finance industry revenue decreased 11% from July 2023. U.S. equity lending revenue fell 20%, while Taiwanese securities revenue increased 59%. Sovereign debt revenue improved 8%. Corporate bonds revenue fell 23%. Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., ImmunityBio Inc., and NuScale Power Co. were the top revenue-earning securities. <br /><br />Summary: <br />Global securities finance industry revenue decreased 11%. U.S. equity lending fell 20%, while Taiwanese securities revenue increased 59%. Sovereign debt revenue improved 8%, but corporate bonds revenue fell 23%. The top revenue-earning securities were Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., ImmunityBio Inc., and NuScale Power Co. <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $843 million in revenue for lenders in July 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents an 11% decrease from the $943 million generated in July 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $219 million in revenue in July, down 7% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Amid a continued bull market, U.S. equity lending revenue remained the most significant laggard, falling 20% year-over-year. Decreased fees were the driver, with the average cost to borrow for U.S. stocks declining 21% from July 2023. However, with fees bouncing in July, U.S. equities showed positive momentum with a 22% revenue increase month-over-month.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the global equity lending market, Taiwanese securities continued to generate strong returns with revenue increasing 59% year-over-year. Loan balances for Taiwan equities climbed a sharp 43% while fees also increase 11% compared to 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In fixed income, global lending revenue for corporate bonds continued to cool, falling 23% year-on-year. The dip was driven by investment-grade issuances, where a 28% drop in fees led to a 21% decline in revenue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global sovereign debt revenue improved 8% year-on-year as balances climbed 15%. U.S. Treasury lending accounted for the bulk of the improvement, with revenue rising 14%.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in July were</span><span>&nbsp;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI US), Lucid Group Inc.</span><span>&nbsp;(LCID US),&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US),&nbsp;</span><span>ImmunityBio Inc. (IBRX US)</span><span>&nbsp;and NuScale Power Co. (SMR US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $87 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: As Tappable Equity Hits Record High Of $11.5T, 3 Of 5 Mortgage Holders Have At Least $100K To Borrow Against</title>

<div> Equity, Mortgage debt, Tappable equity, Leverage ratio, Underwater mortgages
Summary:<br /><br />Outstanding mortgage debt at all-time high of $13.8T, but home prices drive equity to record $17.6T. Tappable equity hits $11.5T. Underwater mortgages at 0.60%. Texas, Florida, and Louisiana worth watching.<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Even as outstanding mortgage debt hit an all-time high of $13.8T in June, rising home prices outpaced that growth, driving mortgage holder equity to its own new record high of $17.6T in Q2 2024</li>
<li>Climbing equity has eased overall leverage in the market, with total mortgage debt equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, down from 44.6% in Q1 and the third lowest leverage ratio of the past 20+ years</li>
<li>Tappable equity &ndash; the amount a borrower can access while maintaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; also hit a new peak in June at $11.5T, a +4% gain from Q1 and +9.2% year over year</li>
<li>32M mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and nearly 1.2M have $1M or more, with higher equity holders tending to have lower first lien rates as well</li>
<li>Borrowers with 760+ credit scores hold two-thirds of tappable equity; a similar share is held by those with sub-4% first lien rates, an inherent incentive to use second lien debt to tap equity, should the need arise</li>
<li>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater nationwide, representing just 0.60% of active mortgages, with another 4.2% having less than 10% equity in their homes</li>
<li>Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas, increasing the number of borrowers in negative equity positions</li>
<li>Nationally, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in markets where prices have pulled back from recent highs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its August 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>Though the ICE Home Price Index (HPI) has shown a general slowdown in the rate of home price growth through June &ndash; and in some locales, price declines driven by surplus inventory &ndash; mortgage holders&rsquo; equity levels continue to hit new heights. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, there is more outstanding mortgage debt today than at any point in history, but at the same time, overall market leverage remains near all-time lows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outstanding mortgage debt, including both first and second liens, hit an all-time high in June, but growth in home prices has outpaced that gradual rise in debt,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Total cumulative debt leverage &ndash; essentially a loan-to-value ratio for the entire mortgage market &ndash; is equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, the third lowest leverage ratio we&rsquo;ve seen in the past 20-plus years. Rising home prices have also continued to build the fortunes of existing homeowners, pushing tappable equity &ndash; the amount a mortgage holder can leverage while retaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; to its highest level ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine out of ten of mortgage holders (48.5M) have some degree of tappable equity. A fair representation of the addressable market for second lien lending, tappable equity continues to be held primarily by higher credit score borrowers with low first lien interest rates. Two-thirds of such equity is held by mortgage holders with credit scores of 760 or higher, with a similar share held by those with first lien rates below 4%.</p>
<p>Three out of five (32M) mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and 1.2M have $1M or more. Higher equity levels tend to correspond with lower first lien interest rates, as those borrowers, on average, were able to capitalize on record low interest rates while also buying into the market earlier at lower prices. The average first lien rate of borrowers without tappable equity is approximately 5.5%, nearly a full percentage point above those with up to $50K available to borrow against (4.45%). Borrowers with $50-$199K to borrow against have average first lien rates of just above 4%, while those with $500K or more to borrow against have average rates of around 3.75%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home equity lending has been sluggish since interest rates began their climb higher early in 2022,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;As the Fed raised short-term lending rates, accessing equity became more expensive for homeowners, evidenced by the anemic growth in such lending despite record levels of available, tappable equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Industry expectations that the Fed will soon begin easing short-term rates could gradually change that dynamic, given the more direct impact short term rates have on home equity rate offerings, and lenders would do well to prepare. The ability to originate and service home equity loans alongside first lien mortgages will be key &ndash; to say nothing of using data-driven portfolio analysis to identify potential second lien customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater on their mortgages nationwide, putting just 0.60% of active loans in a negative equity position, with another 4.2% holding less than 10% equity in their homes. That said, Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas.</p>
<p>In Austin, for example, home prices are more than 15% off 2022 peaks, resulting in some 2.6% of mortgage holders owing more than their homes are currently worth. Similarly, in San Antonio, 2.7% of homes are underwater. Negative equity rates are also rising in Florida, as Cape Coral, Lakeland, North Port and Jacksonville &ndash; where inventories have surged and home prices are softening &ndash; have all seen an increase in negative equity. The same is true of New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana. Nationwide, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in areas like San Antonio, Austin, Cape Coral and North Port, where prices have pulled back from recent highs.</p>

<title>Save The Date! ACER Workshop: Designing Electricity Network Tariffs To Fit The Energy Transition (30 September 2024)</title>

<div> workshop, tariffs, ACER, network, electricity<br />
Summary: 
ACER organizes a workshop on electricity tariffs, discussing dilemmas, solutions, and best practices, and collecting stakeholders' views. <div>
<p>Achieving the EU's climate and energy goals requires significant investment in new network capacities, which increases pressure on network tariffs. Meanwhile, the ongoing electrification and changing grid usage patterns challenge existing tariff designs.</p>
<p>In a decentralised and digitalised energy landscape, these challenges also present opportunities (such as more flexible users and increased automation). Cost-reflective and transparent tariffs can encourage efficient network connection and usage, reducing costs for users.</p>
<p>Setting tariffs is complex, with no &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; design, as regulators need to balance different principles and national specifics. Regulators and stakeholders can benefit from discussing challenges and sharing effective tariff solutions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the event about?</span></p>
<p>Every two years,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECAFSBFFUBUwNVAxSHVYKBgMdUFwHVhpRUVcDAwsNUw8AVFMdUFFVAgkFVlsdVg8NVR0GXwBXGgwHAAYZClZWUlMOBgBTUFoHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER reviews</a>&nbsp;national tariff practices and reports on methodologies and the most effective approaches.</p>
<p>Ahead of ACER&rsquo;s next electricity tariff report (early 2025), ACER organises a workshop to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the most pressing transmission and distribution tariff dilemmas;</li>
<li>debate potential solutions and best practices to address them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save the date &amp; get involved!</span></p>

<div> July, small business, consumer spending, retail, restaurant
Summary:<br />Small business sales rose 3.5% year-over-year and 1.3% month-over-month, with strong retail growth and declining restaurant sales. Utilities and hospitals were the fastest growing categories. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index rises to 141</i> </li>
<li><i>Small business sales grew 3.5% year-over-year, and 1.3% month-over-month</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade; for July 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and nature of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fiserv Small Business Index provides timely and granular insight into consumer spending at small businesses, which is often a bellwether for the broader economy,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;Following modest declines in June, consumer spending rebounded nicely in July to help many small businesses start the second half of the year strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for July rose to 141. This jump in consumer spending followed a four-point decline in June. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+3.5%) and transactions (+3.3%) grew compared to July 2023. Month-over-month small business sales grew (+1.3%) despite transactions slightly declining (-0.7%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending patterns continue to shift, most notably with Retail spend experiencing a decisive bounce back compared to June,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Specialty trade and professional services also performed very well due to seasonal demand and stabilizing inflation rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Retail</span></p>
<p>July saw strong retail spending growth as the national Retail index rose by four points to 146. Year-over-year retail sales (+4.6%) and transactions (+5.8%) increased and all retail subsectors showed growth compared to June. General Merchandise (+10.9%) led retail in yearly growth, followed by Health and Personal Care (+8.6%), Building Equipment and Garden Materials (+6.2%), Food and Beverage Retailers (+4.9) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.7%).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, retail sales (+2.5%) and transactions (+0.1%) grew as higher average ticket sizes drove short-term spending, even though foot traffic remained relatively flat. Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers (+4.8%) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.8%) led growth compared to June, followed by General Merchandise (+3.5%) and Health and Personal Care (+3.1%).</p>
<p><span>Restaurant</span></p>
<p>Food Services and Drinking<span>&nbsp;</span>Places<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 123 for July, a 4-point decline from June. On an annual basis, restaurant sales declined (-1.6%) despite seeing modest growth in foot traffic (+0.7%). Consumers dining out have also seen a significant decrease in average ticket size (-2.4%) compared to July 2023.</p>
<p>Month-over-month restaurant sales (-3.1%) and transactions (-1.4%) both decreased compared to June 2024, marking a second consecutive month of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Similar to the yearly trend, average ticket sizes also declined (-1.7%) on a monthly basis &ndash; indicating that consumers may be feeling some pricing relief when dining out.</p>
<p><span>Other Industry Movers</span></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services continue seeing significant growth in sales (+15.2%) and transactions (+13.9%) year-over-year. Month-over-month performance was strong as well with both total sales and transactions growing (+3.6%) compared to June. Gains in this industry were across a broad range of services, some of which saw increased demand following harsh weather events in June.</li>
<li>Specialty Trade Contractors grew sales (+5.7%) and transactions (+2.5%) year-over-year. Month-over-month sales (+3.0%) also rose despite total transactions (+0.1%) holding steady. Demand for air conditioning and related services drove most of the spending increase, along with broader demand for general construction and carpentry.</li>
<li>Additional year-over-year growth categories included Web Search, Libraries and Information Services (+20.4%), Amusement/Gambling/Recreation (+8.3%) and Food Manufacturing (+8.1%); the sharpest annual declines were in Real Estate (-12.3%) and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing (-10.5%).</li>
<li>Utilities (+6.2%) and Hospitals (+5.7%) were the fastest growing small business categories on a monthly basis; Performing Arts, Spectator Sports and Related Industries (-2.4%), Accommodation (-1.2%) and Insurance (-0.1%) each saw modest month-over-month declines.</li>

<div> electronic trading platform, fixed-income securities, trading volume, variable transaction fees, strategic priority<br />
Summary: MarketAxess Holdings Inc. reported 24.1% increase in total credit ADV in July 2024. Record portfolio trading ADV of $972 million and 35% Open Trading share. Preliminary FPM for total credit was $143. Rates ADV increased 32% year-over-year. U.S. credit market share declined. Municipal bond ADV increased by 65.2% and reached a record estimated market share of 8.6%. The preliminary variable transaction fees per million for total credit was approximately $143, down from $160 in the prior year. The total rates ADV was $22.3 billion, up 32.0% versus the prior year.  <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for July 2024.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;In July, we delivered 12% growth in total credit ADV, driven by an 18% increase in U.S. high-grade, an 18% increase in Eurobonds, a 7% increase in emerging markets and a 65% increase in Municipal bonds on record estimated market share. We also generated record portfolio trading ADV of $972 million. These strong results helped offset a decline in U.S. high-yield ADV. We are not pleased with the progression of U.S. credit market share in July, but we are encouraged by the prospect for potential increases in market volatility in the coming months. We believe that our strategy, including the expansion of our portfolio trading offering and dealer solutions, through the roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro to our global client base, will drive future market share expansion in U.S. credit.&rdquo;</p>

<div> mortgage broker, FCA, order, vulnerable consumers, unauthorised

Summary:
FCA secures £4m order against unauthorised mortgage broker and associates for exploiting vulnerable consumers. Judgment finds serious breaches by LPI and NPI. Trapped individuals with deceptive practices. Enforcement action taken. An order for recovery of funds issued.  <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has secured an order of &pound;4m against an unauthorised mortgage broker and its associates who exploited vulnerable consumers.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>London Property Investments (U.K) Limited (LPI) arranged mortgages while NPI Holdings Limited (NPI) bought properties and rented them back to the sellers, both without FCA authorisation. Daniel Stevens, the director of LPI and NPI, and his father, Tony Stevens, were also found liable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt described these breaches as &lsquo;serious contraventions, conducted over an extended period, involving high levels of culpability including deception of the consumers and the lenders, and which took advantage of the consumers&rsquo; vulnerability&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4 defendants are ordered to pay around &pound;4 million to the FCA. This is an important next step in the case. The FCA will need to recover funds before any compensation can be paid to affected individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LPI is required to remove restrictions registered against the titles of 4 properties. These restrictions were used to force individuals to pay exorbitant fees to LPI. If these fees were not paid, then the individual could not sell or re-mortgage their property. In some cases, this trapped individuals into high-interest bridging loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;&lsquo;These sham brokers preyed on vulnerable people who were struggling financially and trapped them with exorbitant fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The defendants used a smokescreen of deception which cost consumers and lenders dearly. This was a complex case, but the ruling shows that these were serious breaches of our rules. &nbsp;It is only right that we can now pursue LPI, NPI, Daniel and Tony Stevens to compensate for the losses they caused the victims.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt found that LPI had contravened the general prohibition in section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) in relation to 26 further individuals identified by the FCA, and that Tony Stevens and Daniel Stevens were both knowingly concerned in these contraventions. He ordered the defendants to pay for losses caused to these and 45 other individuals.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In July 2020, the FCA obtained an interim injunction and a freezing order to stop these activities and freeze residential properties and other assets owned by Tony and Daniel Stevens and the 2 companies. Read the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-commences-civil-proceedings-relation-alleged-unauthorised-regulated-mortgage-contracts-and-sale" title="FCA commences civil proceedings in relation to alleged unauthorised regulated mortgage contracts and sale and rent back agreements">press release</a>&nbsp;in relation to the commencement of proceedings dated 13 July 2020. &nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> MOU, ESG Data Platform, financing, collaboration, sustainability<br />
Summary:<br />
SET and EXIM Thailand collaborate to enhance sustainable finance, develop ESG-linked financing, and support businesses in achieving sustainability goals. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Thailand) to enhance the ecosystem for sustainable finance. This collaboration, under the ESG Data Linkage and Exchange Project, aims to leverage sustainability performance data of listed companies via the ESG Data Platform. In addition, the partnership will support the SET Carbon system for EXIM Thailand's clients to achieve sustainability goals, aligning with SET&rsquo;s commitment to driving all sectors towards sustainable growth.</p>
<p>SET and EXIM Thailand will jointly develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-linked financing in the third quarter of 2024, with the lending service scheduled to commence in 2025.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b> said that SET has recognized the growing demand for ESG data among investors and financial institutions to develop ESG-related financial and investment products for sustainable development. SET has accelerated the development of ESG data technologies and platforms to meet the demand. Currently, SET has a broad range of ESG data management systems, including the SET ESG Data Platform, which has been operational since 2023 and has compiled ESG data of over 700 listed companies. The upcoming SET Carbon system, slated for 2025, will enable listed companies and their supply chain partners to efficiently calculate and report greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SET unwaveringly fosters collaborations with both domestic and international entities to ensure continuous data exchange and utilization, particularly in using ESG data for fundraising and investment purposes.</p>
<p>The collaboration with EXIM Thailand is expected to increase opportunities for the business sector in accessing funding and financial tools, marking a significant step in developing a sustainable financial ecosystem in Thailand.</p>
<p><b>EXIM Thailand President Rak Vorrakitpokatorn</b> emphasized the banking sector's crucial role in driving balanced growth across economic, social, and environmental dimensions as well as tackling today&rsquo;s environmental challenges. Development banks worldwide are pivotal in providing financing that supports businesses in adapting and thriving, representing up to one-third of global Climate Finance. Positioned as Thailand&rsquo;s Green Development Bank, EXIM Thailand has continuously developed Greenovation to support environmentally friendly projects and businesses.</p>
<p>This partnership with SET represents a collaborative integration between public and private sectors, utilizing an internationally standardized database to propel the Thai financial sector towards sustainability. It also encourages businesses to become more aware of ESG. ESG data from SET will enhance the efficiency of EXIM Thailand's operations while promoting business access to various financial products and benefits, including participation in the Green Export Supply Chain. This will facilitate efficient and effective greenhouse gas management and reporting, compliance with international environmental standards, achievement of sustainable development goals, and drive Thailand towards carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>This partnership will facilitate data connectivity and exchange, increase operational flexibility, and create opportunities for businesses seeking investment to support sustainability goals. SET and EXIM Thailand will co-develop financial products, services, and benefits for stakeholders, while expanding the sustainability ecosystem to help Thai businesses achieve their sustainability and business objectives, particularly in climate change strategies.</p>
<p>For more information, contact SET's Sustainability Service Development Department at +66(0) 2009 9894 or +66(0) 2009 9887, or EXIM Thailand's Product Development Department at +66(0) 2169 9999.</p>

<title>Data Beta: Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Joint Data Standards Proposal, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Interoperability, Legal Entity Identifier, Financial Data Transparency Act, FDTA, data standards
Summary:<br /><br />Implementation of FDTA for financial data transparency examined for costs, benefits, and practicality, emphasizing public input and flexibility in rulemaking. <div>
<p>I support issuing this proposal, which is the first step in implementing the Financial Data Transparency Act (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), which seeks to enhance the accessibility, usefulness, and interoperability of data reported to federal financial regulators. Together with other US financial regulators, we are proposing joint data standards, which we will then apply to our respective rulebooks in agency-specific rulemakings.</p>
<p>If well implemented, the FDTA could enhance the analytical capability of regulators, investors, and other market participants and reduce compliance costs for regulated entities. However, this result is not guaranteed. Mangling implementation could result in costs disproportionate to the benefits. FDTA regulations, for example, could drive municipal issuers away from securities markets, prevent companies from going and staying public, or force the publication of unreliable data. To maximize the potential for the FDTA to serve the public interest, we need broad public input. I urge commenters to address the questions in the proposing release and my additional questions below, as well as to provide advance thoughts on the second, agency-specific, phase of the FDTA rulemaking process.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Costs and benefits</i>: The Commission did not conduct an economic analysis for this proposal, so I particularly welcome commenters&rsquo; input on the proposal&rsquo;s costs and benefits and the economic consequences of subsequent choices that individual agencies might make in their second phase rulemakings.<ol>
<li>Costs of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the total direct and indirect costs of adopting the contemplated data standards? Do these costs vary based on factors such as firm size or type of regulatory filing?</li>
<li>How have standardized data costs changed over time? Will these trends continue?</li>
<li>How much of the FDTA compliance burden is likely to stem from the one-time cost of setting up new data systems as opposed to ongoing compliance costs?</li>
<li>Will certain types of entities, such as municipal issuers, bear disproportionate FDTA-related costs? If so, what can we do to reduce those costs?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Benefits of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the potential benefits of FDTA implementation?</li>
<li>How could the Commission maximize the utility of financial regulatory information filed in compliance with the FDTA-mandated data standards? For example, should the Commission work to reduce error rates in structured data filings?</li>
<li>In light of the Commission&rsquo;s broad discretion in implementing the second phase of FDTA rulemaking, are there areas where full application of these proposed data standards would be particularly helpful or unhelpful?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Financial Data Interoperability.&nbsp;</i>The FDTA aims to promote the interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><ol>
<li>What could the benefits of interoperability be in the intermediate and longer term? What level of interoperability is necessary to achieve these benefits?</li>
<li>What are the largest hurdles to interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators? How should we address those hurdles?</li>
<li>How could we achieve the benefits of interoperability without imposing unnecessary costs on reporting firms, particularly smaller ones?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Legal Entity Identifier</i>: The FDTA mandates a &ldquo;common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license for all entities required to report to&rdquo; the regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The proposal specifies this standard as&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), which the Global LEI Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) manages and supports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><ol>
<li>Mandating the adoption of any product or service managed by a third-party carries risks, including the possibility that the third-party could use its regulatory-mandated advantage to, for example, raise fees inordinately, demand obtrusive information from registrants, or provide poor service. Is this a risk of the LEI mandate? If so, how can we mitigate this risk, or does the existing regulatory oversight of the GLEIF already adequately manage this risk?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Would timely obtaining and maintaining the required LEIs be manageable for small entities and for large entities with many subsidiaries?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>How would an LEI mandate integrate with other entity identifiers such as the Central Index Key (&ldquo;CIK&rdquo;), which identifies EDGAR filers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>CUSIP and FIGI</i>:&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>The proposal&rsquo;s scope designates as an identifier of financial instruments the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (&ldquo;FIGI&rdquo;), which is &ldquo;established by the Object Management Group . . . an open-membership standards consortium.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The joint rulemaking does not include the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedure (&ldquo;CUSIP&rdquo;), a common securities identifier, because CUSIP is &ldquo;proprietary and not available for open license in the United States.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><ol>
<li>Does the FDTA&rsquo;s statutory mandate extend to financial instruments?</li>
<li>Is the proposing release correct that the FIGI does and the CUSIP does not meet the FDTA&rsquo;s criteria for designation as a joint standard? If CUSIP does not now meet the criteria, what changes would enable it to do so?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>What, if any, policy issues arise from the FIGI being managed by a standards consortium?</li>
<li>How should the Commission consider FIGI and CUSIP in setting data standards for financial instruments in the second-phase rulemaking?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Scope of the data standards</i>: To implement the FDTA successfully, we need to scope it properly and remain within statutory parameters.<ol>
<li>Did the joint regulators strike the right balance when choosing the proposal&rsquo;s scope, in light of the statutory mandate?</li>
<li>What policy issues should the Commission consider when adapting its rulebook to conform to the joint data standards, particularly given the statutory discretion afforded to the Commission (and other implementing agencies) in the second-phase rulemaking?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Principles-based regulation and maintaining updated FDTA standards</i>: Hardwiring a technology into a rule runs the risk of preserving that requirement far after that technology&rsquo;s expiration date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;To benefit from FDTA implementation, we need meaningful consistency of data standards across agencies, which requires at least some specificity regarding data standards. If we are not vigilant, however, the FDTA could inhibit data standards from evolving over time or force firms to maintain parallel data systems. The proposal affords some flexibility in data transmission and schema and taxonomy format standards,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;while specifying other data standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><ol>
<li>Does the proposal strike the right balance between principles and prescription? If not, how should the approach change?</li>
<li>Would the balance the proposal strikes allow data standards to be updated in a timely manner? If not, what would work better?</li>
<li>How often should regulators revisit the mandated standards to ensure that they remain current? Should we build a requirement to revisit the standards into the final rule?</li>
<li>How, if at all, will artificial intelligence or other technologies influence the need for structured data? How should we take these potential future developments into account in implementing the FDTA?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed rule is a reasonable first step in the FDTA implementation journey. For this process to have the best chance of unlocking the FDTA&rsquo;s promise and avoiding its peril, public discussion is essential. I welcome commenters&rsquo; thoughts on these questions and how the second phase should unfold, particularly given the meaningful flexibility that the joint regulators will have during that phase.</p>
<p>Joint rulemakings are inevitably challenging. I therefore particularly appreciate the hard work of staff in the SEC&rsquo;s Divisions of Corporation Finance, Economic and Risk Analysis, Investment Management, and Trading and Markets, and in the Offices of the Chief Data Officer, Credit Ratings, the General Counsel, and Municipal Securities, along with staff at the other financial regulators who have worked on this first stage of FDTA implementation.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Data Standards, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Joint Data Standards, LEI, FDTA, Commission, proposal
Summary:<br />The Commission proposes joint data standards, including LEI, for financial reporting, considering concerns over mandating payments to private organizations. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>As part of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Congress directed the Commission and other financial regulatory agencies to jointly propose data standards for (1) certain collections of information reported to each agency by financial entities and (2) the data collected from the agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint standards with the other agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;One part of the proposal establishes International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17442-1:2020, Financial Services &ndash; Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), as the joint standard for the legal entity identifier. While LEI satisfies the FDTA&rsquo;s requirements for a joint data standard, I have concerns were the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and other agencies to ultimately mandate the exclusive use of LEI from a specific organization.</p>
<p>LEI is managed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) and issued through &ldquo;local operating units&rdquo; (&ldquo;LOUs&rdquo;). Although GLEIF is overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee, of which the Commission is a member, neither the committee nor any LOU is a federal or state regulator. Entities must pay a fee to an LOU both to initially obtain an LEI and to renew the LEI annually.</p>
<p>While the fee may be&nbsp;<i>de minimis</i>&nbsp;to some entities, mandating payments to a private third party as a condition to satisfying legal requirements raises significant concerns &ndash; especially when such fees are not subject to approval by Congress or the Commission. If a company wants to raise capital by filing a registration statement, then it needs to first purchase an LEI from a third party.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;If a school or water district seeks to issue tax-exempt bonds to pay for infrastructure, then it needs to purchase an LEI before it can submit materials to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The FDTA amends section 124(c)(1)(A) of the Financial Stability Act to require the joint standards to include &ldquo;a common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The term &ldquo;open license&rdquo; means a legal guarantee that a data asset is made available at no cost to the public and with no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing, or adapting such asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Given these concerns, the Commission should consider alternatives to requiring regulated entities to pay for something &ndash; such as an LEI &ndash; if free alternatives, such as the Central Index Key (CIK) used to make EDGAR filings with the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;or the file number issued by the Delaware Department of State&rsquo;s Division of Corporations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;are available and may also satisfy the FDTA&rsquo;s data standard requirements. One option, consistent with certain of the Commission&rsquo;s forms,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;is to require an entity to use and disclose its LEI only if that entity has already obtained one for other purposes.</p>
<p>I look forward to reviewing the public comments from investors and market participants on the LEI requirement and other aspects of the proposal. In receiving feedback, I am particularly interested in whether the joint data standards being proposed, including LEI, can be obtained or used by non-traditional business organizations that exist today or that may exist in the future, such as those in the crypto and digital assets industry.</p>
<p>Because of the Congressional mandate to undertake this rulemaking, I will support the joint proposal. I thank staff from across the Commission who worked on this proposal, and I would especially like to recognize the staff of the Office of the Chief Data Officer, the Division of Corporation Finance, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis for their involvement and engagement with my staff and me.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Rulemaking, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Aug. 2, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint data standards for information collected by nine financial regulators (the &ldquo;Agencies&rdquo;). Through the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), Congress mandated that the Agencies propose such standards. In fulfilling the Congressional mandate, I&rsquo;m pleased to support this proposal, as it will make financial data collected by the Agencies more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public.</p>
<p>Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.</p>
<p>The proposal puts forward standards with regards to data identifiers, as well as ways to transmit and structure data.</p>
<p>First, with regards to identifiers, the Agencies propose a number of identifiers related to entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For instance, with regards to entities, the joint proposal would establish Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;) as a common entity identifier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, as it relates to geographic jurisdictions, the proposed joint standards use U.S. postal service abbreviations, as well as country codes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;With regard to products and instruments, the proposed joint standard uses three internationally recognized standards for financial instrument identifiers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>All of these common identifiers are non-proprietary and available under an open license.</p>
<p>Secondly, the joint proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to transmitting and structuring data. Under the proposal, any specific format (e.g., eXtensible Markup Language) that enables the structuring and transmission of high-quality, machine-readable data would be permitted.</p>
<p>In addition, Congress required in the FDTA that the joint data standards must, to the extent practicable, &ldquo;use, be consistent with, and implement applicable accounting and reporting principles&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the Agencies are seeking comment on whether to establish joint data standards regarding existing definitions of generally accepted accounting and financial reporting terms. Doing so would benefit both investors and the financial entities who report data.</p>
<p>Upon finalization of these joint standards, Congress has mandated that the SEC and certain other Agencies issue Agency-specific rules that implement the standards. In accordance with the FDTA, Agencies will be permitted flexibility in considering how best to implement the final joint standards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Department of the Treasury, Commodity Futures Trading Commission<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for working with the SEC on this joint rule.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Data Transparency Act, joint data standards, financial regulatory agencies, interoperability <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC proposes joint data standards for financial regulatory agencies to promote interoperability and enable high-quality, machine-readable data submission from financial institutions. <div>
<p>Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed joint data standards under the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 that would establish technical standards for data submitted to certain financial regulatory agencies. Eight additional agencies have proposed or are expected to propose the joint standards: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>The proposed joint standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the agencies by establishing common identifiers for entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proposal will make financial data more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, the proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to data transmission and schema and taxonomy formats, which would enable financial institutions to submit high-quality, machine-readable data to the agencies.</p>
<p>The agencies are in various stages of approving the proposed joint standards, with some agencies scheduled to vote in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The public comment period for the proposed joint standards will remain open for 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<div> resolution, IMF, Executive Directors, Sub-Saharan Africa, representation
Summary: IMF Board of Governors approved a resolution to add a 25th chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on the Executive Board, effective November 1, 2024. <div>
<p>On July 16, 2024, the IMF Board of Governors, the highest decision-making body of the IMF, issued a new resolution to increase the number of Executive Directors on the IMF&rsquo;s Executive Board by adding a 25th chair intended for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>This resolution follows the call, made by the International Monetary and Financial Committee during the 2023 Annual Meetings in Marrakech, for the creation of a 25th chair to improve Sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s voice and representation and the overall balance of regional representation at the Board (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/10/14/pr23353-chairs-statement-forty-eighth-meeting-of-the-imfc">See Press Release 23/353</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board of Governors have taken an important step towards creating an additional 25th&nbsp;chair at our Executive Board to increase Sub-Saharan Africa's representation in IMF decision making, to make our Board more inclusive, and to reflect the region's role in the global economy,&rdquo; said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approval by the Board of Governors to change the size of the Executive Board requires an 85 percent majority of the total voting power. The Fund&rsquo;s membership approved the resolution allowing for the creation of a 25th chair, exceeding the required threshold.</p>
<p>The new Executive Board of 25 Executive Directors will take office on November 1, 2024.</p>

<div> exemption, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Singapore, swap execution facility, regulation <br />
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance.<br />
Summary: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it unanimously approved an amended order that exempts two recognized market operators (RMOs) authorized within Singapore from CFTC swap execution facility (SEF) registration requirements. The exempted RMOs are FMX Securities (Singapore) Pte. Limited and LMAX Pte. Ltd.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Section 5h(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides that the CFTC may grant such an exemption if it finds that a foreign SEF is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in the facility&rsquo;s home country.&nbsp;</span>Likewise, t<span>he CFTC may revoke exempt status when a facility is no longer authorized and/or in good standing in its home country.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On March 13, 2019, the CFTC issued an order determining the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulatory framework for approved exchanges (AEs) and RMOs satisfies the standard in CEA section 5h(g) to exempt a SEF from registration with the CFTC. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7887-19"><span>7887-19</span></a><span>] Under the order, MAS agreed to, on an ongoing basis, request such exemptions for facilities meeting certain legal requirements within Singapore. MAS also agreed to notify the CFTC when an AE or RMO no longer satisfies those requirements and to request the non-compliant facility be removed from exempt status.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This amendment brings the total number of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/International/ForeignMarketsandProducts/ExemptSEFs#Singapore"><span>exempted AEs and RMOs</span></a>&nbsp;<span>to 18.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>"Cboe reported another strong quarter with record net revenue of $514 million, diluted EPS of $1.33, and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $2.15, up a robust 21% from the second quarter of 2023," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "The second quarter results illustrate the durability of the Cboe business model with year-to-date net revenue increasing by a strong 8% and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;coming in 17% higher as compared to first half 2023 levels. I am incredibly pleased with the progress we continue to make as we work through our strategic review, the early output of which is evidenced by our solid expense management trends, improved year-over-year EBITDA margins, and additive capital allocation actions with $90 million of share repurchases during the second quarter and a total of $180 million for the first half of the year. Each component of our exchange ecosystem performed well during the second quarter, and we are well positioned for the second half of the year."</p>
<p>"Cboe reported strong 10% year-over-year net revenue growth in the second quarter as each category of our business posted solid year-over-year trends," said Jill Griebenow, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. "Cash and Spot Markets performance was robust with net revenues growing 15% during the second quarter of 2024. Derivative trends were also solid, up 11% year-over-year, and Data and Access Solutions delivered 5% year-over-year net revenue growth. Notably, adjusted EBITDA margins<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;reached 67% through the first half of 2024, up more than two percentage points as compared to the first half of 2023, and we returned nearly $300 million in capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Moving forward, we anticipate organic total net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to finish in the 6-8% range, up from our prior guidance of the higher end of 5-7%. We are reaffirming our Data and Access Solutions organic net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of 7-10%, but anticipate finishing at the lower end of the guidance range. Additionally, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted operating expense guidance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of $795 to $805 million. We have produced strong results for the first half of 2024 and look forward to delivering durable returns for shareholders in the quarters ahead."</p>

<li>Total revenues less cost of revenues (referred to as "net revenue<sup>2</sup>") of $513.8 million increased 10 percent, compared to $467.1 million in the prior-year period, a result of increases in cash and spot markets, derivatives markets, and data and access solutions net revenue.</li>
<li>Total operating expenses were $303.7 million versus $222.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $81.4 million, primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets recognized in the Digital reporting unit. Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $197.1 million increased 2 percent compared to $192.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services, partially offset by a decline in travel and promotional expenses.</li>
<li>The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 30.8 percent as compared with 30.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to the valuation allowance associated with the impairment of the Globacap investment. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;was 29.5 percent, down 0.2 basis points when compared with 29.7 percent in last year's second quarter.</li>
<li>Diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2024 decreased 15 percent to $1.33 compared to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>of $2.15 increased 21 percent compared to 2023 second quarter results.</li>

<p><b>Discussion of Results by Business Segment:</b></p>
<p><b>Options:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Options net revenue of $306.7 million was up $23.5 million, or 8 percent, from the second quarter of 2023. Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased primarily as a result of a 9 percent increase in index options trading volumes versus the second quarter of 2023. Access and capacity fees and market data fees were 3 percent higher than the second quarter 2023.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased $27.3 million, or 11 percent, reflecting a 1 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV") and a 9 percent increase in total options RPC compared to the second quarter 2023. The increase in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a higher percentage of total options volume.</li>
<li>Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 31.2 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 33.3 percent in the second quarter of 2023, a result of lower multi-list market share as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>

<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased by $7.0 million, or 25 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2023.

<li>Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 11.4 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 12.7 percent in the second quarter of 2023 given higher off-exchange and closing auction share.

European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was &euro;9.6 billion, up 4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2023 given a 10 percent increase in industry market volumes, partially offset by lower market share.

<li>For the second quarter of 2024, Cboe European Equities had 22.5 percent market share, down from 23.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Total market share was negatively impacted by elevated closing auction activity on listing venues and lower lit book market share. Cboe European Equities net capture rate increased 9 percent given a mix shift to higher capture products. Cboe Australia had 20.8 percent market share for the second quarter of 2024, up from 18.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023.

<li>Reaffirms adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $795 to $805 million.

<div> Westminster magistrates court, Peterson Okoh, mortgage fraud, FCA, unauthorized activities
Summary:
Westminster magistrates court hearing alleged mortgage fraud by Peterson Okoh, accused of unauthorized activities and false representation, sent to trial. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Peterson Okoh (of Peckham, London SE15) appeared in Westminster magistrates court on 31 July 2024 for allegedly advising on and arranging mortgages, between January 2018 and December 2023, without being authorised.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also alleges a significant number of mortgage applications advised on and arranged by Mr Okoh contained false information and/or were supported by forged documents.</p>
<p>Mr Okoh has been charged by the FCA with 3 counts of fraud by false representation and 1 count of carrying on regulated activities without authorisation. Mr Okoh has pleaded not guilty to all counts.</p>
<p>The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 28 August 2024.</p>
<p>Peterson Okoh has been released on conditional bail with conditions of home residence, not to carry on acting as a mortgage advisor while unauthorised, and not to contact prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly pending his next appearance.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of Birth: Peterson Okoh (01/10/1960)</li>
<li>The most obvious example of a 'regulated mortgage contract'&nbsp;is a loan made to an individual to enable the individual to buy a home for themselves where the loan is secured on that home. For legal definition of a 'regulated mortgage contract',&nbsp;please refer to Article 61(3)(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001.</li>
<li>Carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation is contrary to section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and is punishable by a fine or up to 2 years in prison.</li>
<li>Fraud by False Representation is contrary to section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 and is punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Okoh has been charged with: 
<ul>
<li>3 counts of fraud by false representation; and</li>
<li>1 count of breaching s19 FSMA</li>

<div> Expansion, Dormant Assets Scheme, Charities, Social Enterprises, Financial Assets
Summary:<br /><br />Millions in dormant funds unlocked for charities and social enterprises, supporting UK growth. FCA facilitates expansion of Dormant Assets Scheme to empower local businesses. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>We have amended our rules and guidance to enable dormant investment assets and client money to be available to the Dormant Assets Scheme (DAS).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Millions in dormant funds have been unlocked for charities and social enterprises, as new rules set out today facilitate the expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme.&nbsp;<span>This second phase of the expansion will bring dormant investment assets and client money in scope.</span></p>
<p>Led by industry and backed by government, the Dormant Asset scheme aims to reunite people with their financial assets. Where that is not possible, this money supports UK growth through good causes such as getting young people into work or offering affordable credit to families.</p>
<p>Since 2011, the UK Dormant Assets Scheme has unlocked more than &pound;745m for social and environment initiatives, from over &pound;1.35 billion in dormant bank and building society accounts. The expansion of the scheme is estimated to potentially unlock a further &pound;880m.</p>
<p>This initiative not only reunites people with their lost money but also empowers local businesses to drive positive change across local communities.</p>
<p>The policy statement outlines technical changes in our Handbook to facilitate the full expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme in the remaining expanded asset classes. The FCA&rsquo;s intention is to ensure any Handbook changes allow firms to participate in the Dormant Assets Scheme and consumers to access reclaims.</p>

<div> Sale, Iress, UK Mortgages, Bain Capital, Divestment
<br />
Iress sold its UK Mortgages business to Bain Capital for £85m, using the proceeds to reduce debt and make progress in its transformation strategy.
<br /><br />Summary: Iress completed the sale of its UK Mortgages business to Bain Capital for £85m, using the proceeds to reduce debt and make progress in its transformation strategy. <div>
<h4><strong><span>Highlights</span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li> <span>Iress&rsquo; UK Mortgages business sold for a total gross cash consideration of &pound;85m ($A167m</span><span>)</span> </li>
<li> <span>Net proceeds from sale to be used to retire debt, reducing debt to leverage ratio to within target band</span> </li>
<li> <span>This is the fourth and largest divestment successfully executed under Iress&rsquo; transformation strategy, marking significant progress.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Iress (IRE: ASX) today announces it has completed the sale of its UK Mortgage Sales &amp; Originations (&ldquo;Mortgages&rdquo;) business to Bain Capital Tech Opportunities LP (&ldquo;Bain Capital&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.iress.com%2Fdocuments%2F1542%2FASX_Release_Iress_enters_into_binding_agreement_with_Bain_Capital_to_sell_its__UxPxwIT.pdf/1/0102019111f0aac0-77f3768b-943b-44c6-9f5a-c48dfcbd9b26-000000/uUtdU57tYXCnq8p9riaw4x8Cqm4=385" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>As announced on 15 March 2024</span></a><span>, Bain has purchased the UK Mortgages business for a total cash consideration of &pound;85m ($A167m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>) before costs.</span></p>
<p><span>Iress&rsquo; Mortgages business provides mortgage sales and origination software (MSO) and associated consulting services to banks and building societies in the UK. Iress acquired the Mortgages business over 10 years ago, during which time it has become a leading provider of mortgage origination software in the UK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group CEO, Marcus Price, said</span></strong><span>: &ldquo;This is the fourth and largest divestment we have successfully executed under our transformation program. The net proceeds of all divestments have been used to retire debt, with our debt to leverage ratio seeing considerable improvement - paving the way for a return to maintainable dividends. As we enter the final months of our transformation program, we can already see a stronger Iress with an improved earnings profile, balance sheet strength and execution discipline priming Iress for future growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group Executive - Wealth &amp; UK, Harry Mitchell</span></strong><span>, said: &ldquo;Completion of the sale was contingent on the novation of existing MSO client contracts to the new owners and we&rsquo;re pleased to have gained the full support of all Mortgages clients. We are confident this is a great result not only for Iress, but also for our clients and people, with Bain Capital fully committed to re-investing in the technology and capabilities that power MSO. Iress&rsquo; UK operations now have a streamlined focus on its core competencies, and we remain committed to driving excellence for our clients in the UK.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Net proceeds from the sale are expected to be approximately &pound;75m ($A147m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>). Iress will provide support services for a period of up to 12 months after the transaction on a cost recovery basis to ensure a smooth transition.</span></p>

<title>ASX Commences Final Of Two Consultations To Decide Scope And Implementation For CHESS Replacement</title>

<div> consultation, ASX, CHESS replacement, settlement cycle, T+1
Summary:<br />ASX consults on CHESS replacement and T+1 settlement cycle, proposes implementation in 2026 and 2029, seeks stakeholder feedback by September 2024.<br /> <div>
<p>ASX today released a public consultation paper which proposes the CHESS replacement settlement and subregister services be implemented in 2029. The paper is the second of two consultations undertaken by ASX this year to gather industry feedback on scope and implementation for the project to replace Australia&rsquo;s cash equities clearing and settlement system (CHESS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also today, ASX published its summary of feedback received on the industry whitepaper it released in April that sought input on a potential move to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1.</p>
<p>Taken together, these papers underscore the ongoing stakeholder engagement ASX has been undertaking to ensure it continues to work closely with industry on the delivery of CHESS replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance</b> said &ldquo;Our commitment to transparent and collaborative consultation is central to the success of the CHESS replacement project as well as Australia&rsquo;s approach to T+1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposal to implement CHESS replacement across two main releases reflects how we&rsquo;ve listened to industry feedback. The staged approach to implementation, where we are delivering the clearing services first in Release 1, followed by delivery of settlement, subregister and additional clearing enhancements in Release 2 is designed to manage several factors, including materially reducing delivery risk and allowing for industry readiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stakeholder input provided via working groups and other forums is incorporated in the consultation paper published today and is reflected as part of the functional scope of Release 2. Industry driven improvements outlined in the consultation paper include items such as continuous netting, account segregation and corporate action elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to the industry whitepaper on T+1 settlement were also a key input into the consultation paper, helping inform the proposed sequencing of CHESS replacement implementation stages and the potential move to T+1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of responses from industry suggest a clear preference to avoid implementing T+1 at the same time as Release 2 of CHESS replacement,&rdquo; Mr Triance said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In light of the feedback received to the industry whitepaper and having regard to the experiences of transitioning to T+1 in other markets we have presented a number of options on timing to transition to T+1 in Australia, and outlined the risks and benefits of each of the options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a decision is made to move to T+1, the paper recommends the option where that would take place at an appropriate time after the implementation of CHESS replacement Release 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX confirmed in June that the delivery of Release 1 is expected to occur in H1 2026. This consultation paper proposes that Release 2 be delivered in 2029, aligning with indicative timeframes previously communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Next steps in consultation process</b></h4>
<p>We encourage feedback from CHESS users and software providers (including both external vendors and CHESS users developing in-house systems), as well as other interested stakeholders on the proposals outlined in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASX is seeking stakeholder feedback by Friday, 13 September 2024. ASX will then take time to review submissions and proposes to provide a consultation response paper in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p>CHESS is the clearing and settlement system for Australia&rsquo;s cash equities market. ASX is undertaking a project to replace CHESS and in November 2023 ASX announced it would proceed with a product based solution design for CHESS replacement that would be delivered by global technology provider TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).&nbsp;</p>

<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced that a Review Group has been set up to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore. The Review Group will be chaired by Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister for Finance and Board Member of MAS, and comprise key private sector stakeholders and public sector representatives.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>A dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain, alongside Singapore&rsquo;s growing private equity and venture capital ecosystem. A deep and liquid public equities market enables companies to access capital as they expand regionally and globally. It also allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies. Improving the attractiveness of Singapore&rsquo;s equities market can therefore enhance Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub. This in turn complements Singapore&rsquo;s innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Government has introduced various initiatives to support enterprise financing and enhance Singapore&rsquo;s equities markets. These include the set-up of cornerstone funds to support initial public offerings of high-growth companies, introduction of corporate structures and share classes to facilitate such listings, and measures to improve research coverage.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will build on these efforts to position Singapore&rsquo;s equities market for growth. The Group will consider additional initiatives to improve the vibrancy of our equities market, and study ways to galvanise greater private sector participation in this effort, including from capital market intermediaries, investors, and listed companies. The Review Group will be supported by two workstreams:</p>
<p>a. The Enterprise and Markets workstream will aim to address market challenges, foster listings, and facilitate market revitalisation; and<br />b. The Regulatory workstream will focus on enhancing the regulatory regime to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.<br /><br />The Terms of Reference and composition of the Review Group are set out in Annex A.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Through the two workstreams, the review process will involve stakeholders with expertise and experience in diverse fields in the capital markets, including corporate finance, investment banking, asset management, legal services, and corporate governance. The Review Group will recommend a set of measures to strengthen the Singapore equities market and complete its report within 12 months.<br /><br /></p>

<title>ASIC’s First Greenwashing Case Results In Landmark $11.3 Million Penalty For Mercer</title>

<div> Penalty, Greenwashing, Financial Services Industry, ESG Claims, Mercer Superannuation<br />
Summary:<br />
- Mercer Superannuation fined $11.3 million for misleading ESG claims<br />
- ASIC's first greenwashing case for financial services industry<br />
- Found to have made misleading statements about sustainable investment options<br />
- Importance of accurate ESG claims highlighted<br />
- Additional cases and infringement notices issued for alleged greenwashing practices<br /> <div>
<p>In a landmark case for ASIC, the Federal Court has ordered Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited to pay a $11.3 million penalty after it admitted it made misleading statements about the sustainable nature and characteristics of some of its superannuation investment options.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, 'This was ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case brought before the Federal Court; a landmark case both for ASIC and for the financial services industry. It demonstrates the importance of making accurate ESG claims to investors and potential investors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court found Mercer made misleading statements on its website about seven &lsquo;Sustainable Plus&rsquo; investment options offered by the Mercer Super Trust, of which Mercer is the trustee. These statements marketed the Sustainable Plus options as suitable for members who &lsquo;are deeply committed to sustainability&rsquo; because they excluded investments in companies involved in carbon intensive fossil fuels like thermal coal. Exclusions were also stated to apply to companies involved in alcohol production and gambling.</p>
<p>The Court found members who took up the Sustainable Plus options had investments in companies involved in industries the website statements said were excluded, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 companies involved in the extraction or sale of carbon intensive fossil fuels (including AGL Energy Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Glencore PLC and Whitehaven Coal Ltd),</li>
<li>15 companies involved in the production of alcohol (including Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, Carlsberg AS, Heineken Holding NV and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd), and</li>
<li>19 companies involved in gambling (including Aristocrat Leisure Limited, Caesar&rsquo;s Entertainment Inc, Crown Resorts Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;s matter is a strong example to the financial services industry of the greenwashing action we will take. We will continue to monitor the market for ESG-related claims that cannot be validated by evidence to ensure the market is fair and transparent,&rsquo; Ms Court added.</p>
<p>When handing down his decision Justice Horan remarked, &lsquo;The contraventions admitted by Mercer are serious. They arose from failures by Mercer to implement adequate systems to ensure that ESG claims in relation to its superannuation products were accurate, and to monitor and enforce the application of any sustainability exclusions associated with such ESG claims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Horan also commented: &lsquo;&hellip;it is vital that consumers in the financial services industry can have confidence in ESG claims made by providers of financial products and services.  As is the case in many other industries, consumers may place great importance on ESG considerations when making investment decisions. Any misrepresentations in relation to ESG policies or practices associated with financial products or services, whether as an aspect of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; practices or otherwise, undermines that confidence to the detriment of consumers and the industry generally.&rsquo;</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Strike Force, unfair pricing, illegal pricing, anticompetitive practices
Summary:
SEC Chair addresses the mission of the SEC, enforcement actions against unfair pricing, rulemaking projects, market oversight, and the potential impact of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good afternoon. I&rsquo;m honored to take part in the first meeting of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>As President Joe Biden said at our most recent Competition Council meeting with him, if you are &ldquo;engaging in illegal practices that are fraudulent or unfair or deceptive or anti-competitive &hellip; we will enforce the law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain that which sits in the middle: fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Thus, guarding against deceptive, fraudulent, or anticompetitive practices is at the heart of what we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>When Congress established the SEC 90 years ago, they embedded antifraud provisions in our key statutes. Congress gave us additional authorities in the 1970s to promote competition and guard against anticompetitive practices when the word competition was added to our statute 20 times.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC pursues these important mandates from Congress every day in overseeing the more than $110 trillion capital markets.</p>
<p>As President Biden further said when announcing the Strike Force, capitalism without competition is not capitalism.</p>
<p>The SEC addresses unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive business practices in all of our work, through enforcement, rulemaking, and market oversight.</p>
<p>The SEC, working through its Enforcement Division, is the cop on the beat for the securities markets. The Commission brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, resulting in $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;While there are many cases related to fraud or unfair practices, I&rsquo;ll highlight three that directly relate to unfair and illegal pricing. Earlier this year we settled an action against TIAA-CREF for making recommendations to retail customers while failing to disclose that substantially equivalent lower-cost shares were available.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we settled a case against Wells Fargo for overcharging advisory accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In 2022, we charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries for not disclosing they were sweeping cash to its affiliate bank, loaning it out, and then keeping the difference between the interest earned on the loans and what it paid in interest to clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through rulemaking projects, works to enhance competition across all three parts of our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;We do so by promoting transparency, access, and fair dealing in the markets. Among the most important projects are focusing on promoting greater competition and access in the $27 trillion U.S. treasury markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;as well as the more than $50 trillion equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through our market oversight, examines registrants. We review the tens of thousands of filings we receive every year from broker-dealers, investment advisers, stock exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory organizations, and issuers. As we conduct such oversight, we stay true to the mandates Congress laid out to guard against fraud and deceptive practices and promote competition.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to mention what may be one of the most transformative technologies&mdash;not only for this time but perhaps our lives, artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This technology offers tremendous promise for individuals and our economy. At the same time, all of our agencies will be pressed to grapple with what this technology means when it comes to guarding against deception, fraud, and anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>As it relates to the securities markets, bad actors might seek to use AI to deceive or defraud the public, investors, and the market. Make no mistake, though, under the securities laws, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>As it relates to the potential for anticompetitive behavior, we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere in our economy that one or a small number of tech platforms can come to dominate a field. Due to cost, reach, and network economics, we may see the same come to pass in the fields of AI and related data aggregation. Further, bad actors might try to use AI to game the system and signal to competitors about pricing or otherwise to undermine competition.</p>
<p>I look forward to collaborating with others here on these important matters.</p>

<div> Supreme Court of Canada, BCSC, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, financial sanctions, Poonians
<br />
The BCSC seeks changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after the Supreme Court ruled that financial penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy. The court ruled in favor of BCSC's disgorgement orders but against administrative penalties. BCSC has had over 40 debts extinguished through bankruptcy since 2001. The BCSC is calling for a revision of the law to address this loophole.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The BCSC is calling for changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after a Supreme Court ruling regarding financial penalties and bankruptcy. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is calling for changing the federal&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some financial sanctions can be extinguished through the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>The court, in a 5-2&nbsp;<a href="https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/20555/index.do" target="_blank">decision</a>, said that administrative penalties, which are imposed by the BCSC and other Canadian securities regulators to deter future misconduct, can be eliminated from a person&rsquo;s debt upon being discharged from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case demonstrates one of the many challenges securities regulators face in collecting financial penalties from lawbreakers,&rdquo; said BCSC Chair &amp; CEO Brenda Leong. &ldquo;The fact that administrative penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy seriously undermines securities regulators&rsquo; duty to protect investors, and highlights a significant flaw in federal bankruptcy law that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruling came in litigation between the BCSC and a B.C. couple, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian. A BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2014/73-bcsc-panel-finds-that-five-bc-residents-engaged-in-market-manipulation" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;that they ran a pump-and-dump scheme involving an Ontario company whose shares traded on the TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel concluded that the Poonians inflated the company&rsquo;s share price through trading among themselves, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and then illegally obtained approximately $7 million by selling shares to unsuspecting buyers, many of them living paycheck to paycheck. Most of them had no idea they were victims of misconduct until they were contacted by the BCSC.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel levied two types of financial sanctions against the Poonians:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative penalties of $13.5 million, intended to deter future misconduct by the Poonians and others who might contemplate committing similar wrongdoing</li>
<li>Disgorgement of $5.6 million, representing the amount the Poonians obtained from their illegal activity. Any funds collected for disgorgement orders can be returned to victims of that misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Poonians have not made any effort to pay. After the BCSC imposed its sanctions, they filed for bankruptcy. The Poonians asked the B.C. Supreme Court to extinguish their debts, including those owed to the BCSC but that request &ndash; which was opposed by the BCSC &ndash; was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2020/33-bc-couple-owing-19-million-to-bcsc-must-remain-in-bankruptcy" target="_blank">denied</a>&nbsp;by the court in 2020.</p>
<p>The BCSC also applied to the court for an order that its financial sanctions against the Poonians persist, even if all of the couple&rsquo;s other debts are extinguished through bankruptcy, because the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;allows some types of debts to survive bankruptcy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debts arising from a fine, penalty or restitution order imposed by a court, and</li>
<li>Debts arising by obtaining property or services by false pretenses or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCSC argued that its sanctions &ndash; both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders &ndash; met those criteria.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously agreed with the BCSC that &ldquo;the Poonians&rsquo; scheme to mislead and exploit investors amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation.&rdquo; But it did not agree that the sanctions, despite being registered with a court, qualified as court-imposed orders.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s five-member majority said there is a direct link between the amounts of the disgorgement orders and the Poonians&rsquo; fraudulent conduct, so those debts to the BCSC survive bankruptcy. But the administrative penalties, the majority said, arose most directly from the BCSC&rsquo;s decision to sanction the couple, and only indirectly from the Poonians&rsquo; unlawful conduct. So those penalties, the majority said, are extinguished if the Poonians exit bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two justices dissented, saying that the administrative penalties, along with disgorgement, should persist to &ldquo;ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that the Poonians, as a result of this decision, will forever owe $5.6 million, which represents the money they obtained from their pump-and-dump scheme,&rdquo; Leong said. &ldquo;However, this has always been about more than this one case, and we are disappointed that people who cheat or swindle investors can avoid paying administrative penalties through an exit from bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2001, more than 40 individuals and companies, owing a total of about $80 million to the BCSC, have gone through bankruptcy, and as a result, have had their BCSC debts extinguished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its written opinion, said that Parliament could have drafted the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;to expressly say that financial sanctions of regulatory bodies or administrative tribunals are exempt from bankruptcy discharge. But the Act does not say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An obvious solution is to revise the law to deal with this &lsquo;escape hatch,&rsquo;&rdquo; Leong said.</p>

<title>The EBA And ECB Release A Joint Report On Payment Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-and-ecb-release-a-joint-report-on-payment-fraud/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-and-ecb-release-a-joint-report-on-payment-fraud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) published today a joint Report on payment fraud data. The report assesses payment fraud reported by the industry across the European Economic Areas (EEA), which amounted to &euro;4.3bn in 2022 and &euro;2.0bn in the first half of 2023. The Report confirms the beneficial impact of strong customer authentication (SCA) on fraud levels.</span></p>
<p>The Report examines the total number of payment transactions and the subset of fraudulent transactions in terms of value and volume. In addition to the aggregated values, the Report also presents data based on volumes and also sorted by type of payment instruments, i.e. credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals, and e-money transactions.</p>
<p>SCA-authenticated transactions featured lower fraud rates than non-SCA transactions, especially for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes. Furthermore, fraud shares for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes, were 10 times higher when the counterpart is located outside the EEA, where the application of SCA is not legally required and may therefore not have been requested. Hence, the report confirms the beneficial impact of the SCA requirements that were introduced by the PSD2 and the supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj">technical standards</a>&nbsp;that the EBA had issued in 2018 in close cooperation with the ECB.</p>
<p>The Report also finds that losses due to frauds were distributed differently among liability bearers depending on the payment instrument.</p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB will continue to monitor fraud data and going forward, will publish the aggregate data on an annual basis. This initial rReport presents observations in a descriptive way, while future editions will also include explanations of the data and observed trends.</p>
<p><span>Background and legal basis</span></p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB, in their respective roles as supervisory authority of payment service providers and overseer of payment systems, instruments, schemes and arrangements, closely monitor developments in payment fraud. Both the EBA and the ECB thereby rely on statistical information on the volumes and values of payment transactions and corresponding fraud reported by payment service providers (PSPs) located in the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 96(6) of PSD2, PSPs are required to report statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities (NCAs). NCAs, in turn, are required to provide both the EBA and the ECB with this data in aggregated form. In support of these provisions, the EBA Guidelines on fraud reporting under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2018/05, hereafter &ldquo;EBA Guidelines&rdquo;), which apply since 1 January 2019, specify the data that should be reported under the PSD2. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 1409/2013 of the European Central Bank on payments statistics (ECB/2013/43), as amended (hereafter &lsquo;ECB Regulation on payments statistics&rsquo;), requires PSPs located in the euro area to report inter alia detailed information on payment fraud to their national central banks, which in turn shall share the data in aggregated form with the ECB. &nbsp;Data under both the EBA Guidelines and the ECB Regulation on payments statistics is reported on a semi-annual basis.&nbsp;<br />This Report, jointly prepared by the EBA and the ECB, presents a comprehensive overview of the latest data collected under the above-mentioned frameworks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISI Markets, the leading provider of macroeconomic data, industry, company and sovereign intelligence, today announces the acquisition of EPFR, the global leader in fund flows and allocation data.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of EPFR, ISI Markets gains a proprietary macro funds flow dataset and proposition, reinforcing ISI&rsquo;s strategy of curating and delivering difficult-to-source &ldquo;macro to micro&rdquo; data, helping inform buy- and sell-side firms&rsquo; strategies and investment decisions across global markets, including on the world&rsquo;s fastest growing and highest potential economies.</p>
<p>EPFR, which is renowned for its breadth, granularity, and frequency of global fund flows coverage, will operate alongside ISI Markets&rsquo; leading global macroeconomic and financial market data business, CEIC. Combining the firms&rsquo; offerings provides ISI Markets&rsquo; clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and banks, comprehensive data and insight on investor sentiment and money movements across regions and asset classes, whilst streamlining workflows and enhancing investment models for economists, quantitative analysts and investment professionals with the tightest integration of datasets.</p>
<p>Steve Pulley, CEO of ISI Markets, commented: &ldquo;The strategic acquisition of EPFR marks a pivotal step in the evolution of ISI Markets. Bringing greater scale in terms of breadth of buy- and sell-side relationships across North America and Europe and material expansion of our proprietary data asset, ISI Markets is now positioned as a unique global data and intelligence platform providing excellent coverage of developed markets whilst remaining best in breed on emerging markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pascal Ambrosi, Partner at Montagu, commented: &ldquo;This acquisition reflects the strong synergy that has developed between EPFR and ISI Markets over time, as the two became truly global service providers with a strategic focus on more deeply supporting buy- and sell-side client workflows. The transaction will also enable the companies to expand their geographic reach and tap into markets in North America/Europe and Asia respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acquisition follows the partnership announced earlier this year which saw ISI Markets integrate EPFR fund flows and asset allocation data across all major asset classes, tracking over 150,000 traditional and alternative fund-share classes, into CEIC&rsquo;s workflow and analytics platform. By combining EPFR's data with over 3,500 other economic and financial data sources, the combined offering has equipped investment professionals with the ability to better understand the linkages between economic factors, investor sentiment and asset class performance.</p>
<p>EPFR was carved out from Informa PLC by Montagu in October 2022 and is the second acquisition by ISI Markets since Montagu acquired ISI in December 2020 and follows the acquisition of REDD Intelligence, the leading emerging market corporate and sovereign intelligence provider for high yield, private credit, distressed and event-driven special situations.&nbsp; ISI Markets also offers EMIS, the award-winning AI powered market intelligence and research platform.</p>
