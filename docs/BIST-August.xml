<div> consultation, ASX, CHESS replacement, settlement cycle, T+1
Summary:<br />ASX consults on CHESS replacement and T+1 settlement cycle, proposes implementation in 2026 and 2029, seeks stakeholder feedback by September 2024.<br /> <div>
<p>ASX today released a public consultation paper which proposes the CHESS replacement settlement and subregister services be implemented in 2029. The paper is the second of two consultations undertaken by ASX this year to gather industry feedback on scope and implementation for the project to replace Australia&rsquo;s cash equities clearing and settlement system (CHESS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also today, ASX published its summary of feedback received on the industry whitepaper it released in April that sought input on a potential move to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1.</p>
<p>Taken together, these papers underscore the ongoing stakeholder engagement ASX has been undertaking to ensure it continues to work closely with industry on the delivery of CHESS replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance</b> said &ldquo;Our commitment to transparent and collaborative consultation is central to the success of the CHESS replacement project as well as Australia&rsquo;s approach to T+1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposal to implement CHESS replacement across two main releases reflects how we&rsquo;ve listened to industry feedback. The staged approach to implementation, where we are delivering the clearing services first in Release 1, followed by delivery of settlement, subregister and additional clearing enhancements in Release 2 is designed to manage several factors, including materially reducing delivery risk and allowing for industry readiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stakeholder input provided via working groups and other forums is incorporated in the consultation paper published today and is reflected as part of the functional scope of Release 2. Industry driven improvements outlined in the consultation paper include items such as continuous netting, account segregation and corporate action elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to the industry whitepaper on T+1 settlement were also a key input into the consultation paper, helping inform the proposed sequencing of CHESS replacement implementation stages and the potential move to T+1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of responses from industry suggest a clear preference to avoid implementing T+1 at the same time as Release 2 of CHESS replacement,&rdquo; Mr Triance said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In light of the feedback received to the industry whitepaper and having regard to the experiences of transitioning to T+1 in other markets we have presented a number of options on timing to transition to T+1 in Australia, and outlined the risks and benefits of each of the options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a decision is made to move to T+1, the paper recommends the option where that would take place at an appropriate time after the implementation of CHESS replacement Release 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX confirmed in June that the delivery of Release 1 is expected to occur in H1 2026. This consultation paper proposes that Release 2 be delivered in 2029, aligning with indicative timeframes previously communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Next steps in consultation process</b></h4>
<p>We encourage feedback from CHESS users and software providers (including both external vendors and CHESS users developing in-house systems), as well as other interested stakeholders on the proposals outlined in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASX is seeking stakeholder feedback by Friday, 13 September 2024. ASX will then take time to review submissions and proposes to provide a consultation response paper in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p>CHESS is the clearing and settlement system for Australia&rsquo;s cash equities market. ASX is undertaking a project to replace CHESS and in November 2023 ASX announced it would proceed with a product based solution design for CHESS replacement that would be delivered by global technology provider TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).&nbsp;</p>

Summary: The MAS has set up a Review Group to strengthen Singapore's equities market, focusing on market challenges, listings, regulatory enhancements, and stakeholder participation. <br /><br /> <div>

<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced that a Review Group has been set up to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore. The Review Group will be chaired by Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister for Finance and Board Member of MAS, and comprise key private sector stakeholders and public sector representatives.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>A dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain, alongside Singapore&rsquo;s growing private equity and venture capital ecosystem. A deep and liquid public equities market enables companies to access capital as they expand regionally and globally. It also allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies. Improving the attractiveness of Singapore&rsquo;s equities market can therefore enhance Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub. This in turn complements Singapore&rsquo;s innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Government has introduced various initiatives to support enterprise financing and enhance Singapore&rsquo;s equities markets. These include the set-up of cornerstone funds to support initial public offerings of high-growth companies, introduction of corporate structures and share classes to facilitate such listings, and measures to improve research coverage.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will build on these efforts to position Singapore&rsquo;s equities market for growth. The Group will consider additional initiatives to improve the vibrancy of our equities market, and study ways to galvanise greater private sector participation in this effort, including from capital market intermediaries, investors, and listed companies. The Review Group will be supported by two workstreams:</p>
<p>a. The Enterprise and Markets workstream will aim to address market challenges, foster listings, and facilitate market revitalisation; and<br />b. The Regulatory workstream will focus on enhancing the regulatory regime to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.<br /><br />The Terms of Reference and composition of the Review Group are set out in Annex A.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Through the two workstreams, the review process will involve stakeholders with expertise and experience in diverse fields in the capital markets, including corporate finance, investment banking, asset management, legal services, and corporate governance. The Review Group will recommend a set of measures to strengthen the Singapore equities market and complete its report within 12 months.<br /><br /></p>

<title>ASIC’s First Greenwashing Case Results In Landmark $11.3 Million Penalty For Mercer</title>

<div> Penalty, Greenwashing, Financial Services Industry, ESG Claims, Mercer Superannuation<br />
Summary:<br />
- Mercer Superannuation fined $11.3 million for misleading ESG claims<br />
- ASIC's first greenwashing case for financial services industry<br />
- Found to have made misleading statements about sustainable investment options<br />
- Importance of accurate ESG claims highlighted<br />
- Additional cases and infringement notices issued for alleged greenwashing practices<br /> <div>
<p>In a landmark case for ASIC, the Federal Court has ordered Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited to pay a $11.3 million penalty after it admitted it made misleading statements about the sustainable nature and characteristics of some of its superannuation investment options.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, 'This was ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case brought before the Federal Court; a landmark case both for ASIC and for the financial services industry. It demonstrates the importance of making accurate ESG claims to investors and potential investors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court found Mercer made misleading statements on its website about seven &lsquo;Sustainable Plus&rsquo; investment options offered by the Mercer Super Trust, of which Mercer is the trustee. These statements marketed the Sustainable Plus options as suitable for members who &lsquo;are deeply committed to sustainability&rsquo; because they excluded investments in companies involved in carbon intensive fossil fuels like thermal coal. Exclusions were also stated to apply to companies involved in alcohol production and gambling.</p>
<p>The Court found members who took up the Sustainable Plus options had investments in companies involved in industries the website statements said were excluded, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 companies involved in the extraction or sale of carbon intensive fossil fuels (including AGL Energy Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Glencore PLC and Whitehaven Coal Ltd),</li>
<li>15 companies involved in the production of alcohol (including Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, Carlsberg AS, Heineken Holding NV and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd), and</li>
<li>19 companies involved in gambling (including Aristocrat Leisure Limited, Caesar&rsquo;s Entertainment Inc, Crown Resorts Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;s matter is a strong example to the financial services industry of the greenwashing action we will take. We will continue to monitor the market for ESG-related claims that cannot be validated by evidence to ensure the market is fair and transparent,&rsquo; Ms Court added.</p>
<p>When handing down his decision Justice Horan remarked, &lsquo;The contraventions admitted by Mercer are serious. They arose from failures by Mercer to implement adequate systems to ensure that ESG claims in relation to its superannuation products were accurate, and to monitor and enforce the application of any sustainability exclusions associated with such ESG claims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Horan also commented: &lsquo;&hellip;it is vital that consumers in the financial services industry can have confidence in ESG claims made by providers of financial products and services.  As is the case in many other industries, consumers may place great importance on ESG considerations when making investment decisions. Any misrepresentations in relation to ESG policies or practices associated with financial products or services, whether as an aspect of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; practices or otherwise, undermines that confidence to the detriment of consumers and the industry generally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mercer Super has agreed to pay ASIC&rsquo;s costs.</p>

<title>Prepared Remarks Before The Strike Force On Unfair And Illegal Pricing, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Aug. 1, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Strike Force, unfair pricing, illegal pricing, anticompetitive practices
Summary:
SEC Chair addresses the mission of the SEC, enforcement actions against unfair pricing, rulemaking projects, market oversight, and the potential impact of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good afternoon. I&rsquo;m honored to take part in the first meeting of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>As President Joe Biden said at our most recent Competition Council meeting with him, if you are &ldquo;engaging in illegal practices that are fraudulent or unfair or deceptive or anti-competitive &hellip; we will enforce the law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain that which sits in the middle: fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Thus, guarding against deceptive, fraudulent, or anticompetitive practices is at the heart of what we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>When Congress established the SEC 90 years ago, they embedded antifraud provisions in our key statutes. Congress gave us additional authorities in the 1970s to promote competition and guard against anticompetitive practices when the word competition was added to our statute 20 times.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC pursues these important mandates from Congress every day in overseeing the more than $110 trillion capital markets.</p>
<p>As President Biden further said when announcing the Strike Force, capitalism without competition is not capitalism.</p>
<p>The SEC addresses unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive business practices in all of our work, through enforcement, rulemaking, and market oversight.</p>
<p>The SEC, working through its Enforcement Division, is the cop on the beat for the securities markets. The Commission brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, resulting in $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;While there are many cases related to fraud or unfair practices, I&rsquo;ll highlight three that directly relate to unfair and illegal pricing. Earlier this year we settled an action against TIAA-CREF for making recommendations to retail customers while failing to disclose that substantially equivalent lower-cost shares were available.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we settled a case against Wells Fargo for overcharging advisory accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In 2022, we charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries for not disclosing they were sweeping cash to its affiliate bank, loaning it out, and then keeping the difference between the interest earned on the loans and what it paid in interest to clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through rulemaking projects, works to enhance competition across all three parts of our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;We do so by promoting transparency, access, and fair dealing in the markets. Among the most important projects are focusing on promoting greater competition and access in the $27 trillion U.S. treasury markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;as well as the more than $50 trillion equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through our market oversight, examines registrants. We review the tens of thousands of filings we receive every year from broker-dealers, investment advisers, stock exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory organizations, and issuers. As we conduct such oversight, we stay true to the mandates Congress laid out to guard against fraud and deceptive practices and promote competition.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to mention what may be one of the most transformative technologies&mdash;not only for this time but perhaps our lives, artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This technology offers tremendous promise for individuals and our economy. At the same time, all of our agencies will be pressed to grapple with what this technology means when it comes to guarding against deception, fraud, and anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>As it relates to the securities markets, bad actors might seek to use AI to deceive or defraud the public, investors, and the market. Make no mistake, though, under the securities laws, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>As it relates to the potential for anticompetitive behavior, we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere in our economy that one or a small number of tech platforms can come to dominate a field. Due to cost, reach, and network economics, we may see the same come to pass in the fields of AI and related data aggregation. Further, bad actors might try to use AI to game the system and signal to competitors about pricing or otherwise to undermine competition.</p>
<p>I look forward to collaborating with others here on these important matters.</p>

<div> Supreme Court of Canada, BCSC, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, financial sanctions, Poonians
<br />
The BCSC seeks changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after the Supreme Court ruled that financial penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy. The court ruled in favor of BCSC's disgorgement orders but against administrative penalties. BCSC has had over 40 debts extinguished through bankruptcy since 2001. The BCSC is calling for a revision of the law to address this loophole.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The BCSC is calling for changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after a Supreme Court ruling regarding financial penalties and bankruptcy. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is calling for changing the federal&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some financial sanctions can be extinguished through the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>The court, in a 5-2&nbsp;<a href="https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/20555/index.do" target="_blank">decision</a>, said that administrative penalties, which are imposed by the BCSC and other Canadian securities regulators to deter future misconduct, can be eliminated from a person&rsquo;s debt upon being discharged from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case demonstrates one of the many challenges securities regulators face in collecting financial penalties from lawbreakers,&rdquo; said BCSC Chair &amp; CEO Brenda Leong. &ldquo;The fact that administrative penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy seriously undermines securities regulators&rsquo; duty to protect investors, and highlights a significant flaw in federal bankruptcy law that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruling came in litigation between the BCSC and a B.C. couple, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian. A BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2014/73-bcsc-panel-finds-that-five-bc-residents-engaged-in-market-manipulation" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;that they ran a pump-and-dump scheme involving an Ontario company whose shares traded on the TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel concluded that the Poonians inflated the company&rsquo;s share price through trading among themselves, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and then illegally obtained approximately $7 million by selling shares to unsuspecting buyers, many of them living paycheck to paycheck. Most of them had no idea they were victims of misconduct until they were contacted by the BCSC.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel levied two types of financial sanctions against the Poonians:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative penalties of $13.5 million, intended to deter future misconduct by the Poonians and others who might contemplate committing similar wrongdoing</li>
<li>Disgorgement of $5.6 million, representing the amount the Poonians obtained from their illegal activity. Any funds collected for disgorgement orders can be returned to victims of that misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Poonians have not made any effort to pay. After the BCSC imposed its sanctions, they filed for bankruptcy. The Poonians asked the B.C. Supreme Court to extinguish their debts, including those owed to the BCSC but that request &ndash; which was opposed by the BCSC &ndash; was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2020/33-bc-couple-owing-19-million-to-bcsc-must-remain-in-bankruptcy" target="_blank">denied</a>&nbsp;by the court in 2020.</p>
<p>The BCSC also applied to the court for an order that its financial sanctions against the Poonians persist, even if all of the couple&rsquo;s other debts are extinguished through bankruptcy, because the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;allows some types of debts to survive bankruptcy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debts arising from a fine, penalty or restitution order imposed by a court, and</li>
<li>Debts arising by obtaining property or services by false pretenses or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCSC argued that its sanctions &ndash; both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders &ndash; met those criteria.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously agreed with the BCSC that &ldquo;the Poonians&rsquo; scheme to mislead and exploit investors amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation.&rdquo; But it did not agree that the sanctions, despite being registered with a court, qualified as court-imposed orders.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s five-member majority said there is a direct link between the amounts of the disgorgement orders and the Poonians&rsquo; fraudulent conduct, so those debts to the BCSC survive bankruptcy. But the administrative penalties, the majority said, arose most directly from the BCSC&rsquo;s decision to sanction the couple, and only indirectly from the Poonians&rsquo; unlawful conduct. So those penalties, the majority said, are extinguished if the Poonians exit bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two justices dissented, saying that the administrative penalties, along with disgorgement, should persist to &ldquo;ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that the Poonians, as a result of this decision, will forever owe $5.6 million, which represents the money they obtained from their pump-and-dump scheme,&rdquo; Leong said. &ldquo;However, this has always been about more than this one case, and we are disappointed that people who cheat or swindle investors can avoid paying administrative penalties through an exit from bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2001, more than 40 individuals and companies, owing a total of about $80 million to the BCSC, have gone through bankruptcy, and as a result, have had their BCSC debts extinguished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its written opinion, said that Parliament could have drafted the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;to expressly say that financial sanctions of regulatory bodies or administrative tribunals are exempt from bankruptcy discharge. But the Act does not say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An obvious solution is to revise the law to deal with this &lsquo;escape hatch,&rsquo;&rdquo; Leong said.</p>

<title>The EBA And ECB Release A Joint Report On Payment Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-and-ecb-release-a-joint-report-on-payment-fraud/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-and-ecb-release-a-joint-report-on-payment-fraud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) published today a joint Report on payment fraud data. The report assesses payment fraud reported by the industry across the European Economic Areas (EEA), which amounted to &euro;4.3bn in 2022 and &euro;2.0bn in the first half of 2023. The Report confirms the beneficial impact of strong customer authentication (SCA) on fraud levels.</span></p>
<p>The Report examines the total number of payment transactions and the subset of fraudulent transactions in terms of value and volume. In addition to the aggregated values, the Report also presents data based on volumes and also sorted by type of payment instruments, i.e. credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals, and e-money transactions.</p>
<p>SCA-authenticated transactions featured lower fraud rates than non-SCA transactions, especially for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes. Furthermore, fraud shares for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes, were 10 times higher when the counterpart is located outside the EEA, where the application of SCA is not legally required and may therefore not have been requested. Hence, the report confirms the beneficial impact of the SCA requirements that were introduced by the PSD2 and the supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj">technical standards</a>&nbsp;that the EBA had issued in 2018 in close cooperation with the ECB.</p>
<p>The Report also finds that losses due to frauds were distributed differently among liability bearers depending on the payment instrument.</p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB will continue to monitor fraud data and going forward, will publish the aggregate data on an annual basis. This initial rReport presents observations in a descriptive way, while future editions will also include explanations of the data and observed trends.</p>
<p><span>Background and legal basis</span></p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB, in their respective roles as supervisory authority of payment service providers and overseer of payment systems, instruments, schemes and arrangements, closely monitor developments in payment fraud. Both the EBA and the ECB thereby rely on statistical information on the volumes and values of payment transactions and corresponding fraud reported by payment service providers (PSPs) located in the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 96(6) of PSD2, PSPs are required to report statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities (NCAs). NCAs, in turn, are required to provide both the EBA and the ECB with this data in aggregated form. In support of these provisions, the EBA Guidelines on fraud reporting under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2018/05, hereafter &ldquo;EBA Guidelines&rdquo;), which apply since 1 January 2019, specify the data that should be reported under the PSD2. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 1409/2013 of the European Central Bank on payments statistics (ECB/2013/43), as amended (hereafter &lsquo;ECB Regulation on payments statistics&rsquo;), requires PSPs located in the euro area to report inter alia detailed information on payment fraud to their national central banks, which in turn shall share the data in aggregated form with the ECB. &nbsp;Data under both the EBA Guidelines and the ECB Regulation on payments statistics is reported on a semi-annual basis.&nbsp;<br />This Report, jointly prepared by the EBA and the ECB, presents a comprehensive overview of the latest data collected under the above-mentioned frameworks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISI Markets, the leading provider of macroeconomic data, industry, company and sovereign intelligence, today announces the acquisition of EPFR, the global leader in fund flows and allocation data.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of EPFR, ISI Markets gains a proprietary macro funds flow dataset and proposition, reinforcing ISI&rsquo;s strategy of curating and delivering difficult-to-source &ldquo;macro to micro&rdquo; data, helping inform buy- and sell-side firms&rsquo; strategies and investment decisions across global markets, including on the world&rsquo;s fastest growing and highest potential economies.</p>
<p>EPFR, which is renowned for its breadth, granularity, and frequency of global fund flows coverage, will operate alongside ISI Markets&rsquo; leading global macroeconomic and financial market data business, CEIC. Combining the firms&rsquo; offerings provides ISI Markets&rsquo; clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and banks, comprehensive data and insight on investor sentiment and money movements across regions and asset classes, whilst streamlining workflows and enhancing investment models for economists, quantitative analysts and investment professionals with the tightest integration of datasets.</p>
<p>Steve Pulley, CEO of ISI Markets, commented: &ldquo;The strategic acquisition of EPFR marks a pivotal step in the evolution of ISI Markets. Bringing greater scale in terms of breadth of buy- and sell-side relationships across North America and Europe and material expansion of our proprietary data asset, ISI Markets is now positioned as a unique global data and intelligence platform providing excellent coverage of developed markets whilst remaining best in breed on emerging markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pascal Ambrosi, Partner at Montagu, commented: &ldquo;This acquisition reflects the strong synergy that has developed between EPFR and ISI Markets over time, as the two became truly global service providers with a strategic focus on more deeply supporting buy- and sell-side client workflows. The transaction will also enable the companies to expand their geographic reach and tap into markets in North America/Europe and Asia respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acquisition follows the partnership announced earlier this year which saw ISI Markets integrate EPFR fund flows and asset allocation data across all major asset classes, tracking over 150,000 traditional and alternative fund-share classes, into CEIC&rsquo;s workflow and analytics platform. By combining EPFR's data with over 3,500 other economic and financial data sources, the combined offering has equipped investment professionals with the ability to better understand the linkages between economic factors, investor sentiment and asset class performance.</p>
<p>EPFR was carved out from Informa PLC by Montagu in October 2022 and is the second acquisition by ISI Markets since Montagu acquired ISI in December 2020 and follows the acquisition of REDD Intelligence, the leading emerging market corporate and sovereign intelligence provider for high yield, private credit, distressed and event-driven special situations.&nbsp; ISI Markets also offers EMIS, the award-winning AI powered market intelligence and research platform.</p>
