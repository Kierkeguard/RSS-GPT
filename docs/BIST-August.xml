<div> Equity, Mortgage debt, Tappable equity, Leverage ratio, Underwater mortgages
Summary:<br><br>Outstanding mortgage debt at all-time high of $13.8T, but home prices drive equity to record $17.6T. Tappable equity hits $11.5T. Underwater mortgages at 0.60%. Texas, Florida, and Louisiana worth watching.<br> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Even as outstanding mortgage debt hit an all-time high of $13.8T in June, rising home prices outpaced that growth, driving mortgage holder equity to its own new record high of $17.6T in Q2 2024</li>
<li>Climbing equity has eased overall leverage in the market, with total mortgage debt equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, down from 44.6% in Q1 and the third lowest leverage ratio of the past 20+ years</li>
<li>Tappable equity &ndash; the amount a borrower can access while maintaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; also hit a new peak in June at $11.5T, a +4% gain from Q1 and +9.2% year over year</li>
<li>32M mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and nearly 1.2M have $1M or more, with higher equity holders tending to have lower first lien rates as well</li>
<li>Borrowers with 760+ credit scores hold two-thirds of tappable equity; a similar share is held by those with sub-4% first lien rates, an inherent incentive to use second lien debt to tap equity, should the need arise</li>
<li>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater nationwide, representing just 0.60% of active mortgages, with another 4.2% having less than 10% equity in their homes</li>
<li>Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas, increasing the number of borrowers in negative equity positions</li>
<li>Nationally, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in markets where prices have pulled back from recent highs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its August 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>Though the ICE Home Price Index (HPI) has shown a general slowdown in the rate of home price growth through June &ndash; and in some locales, price declines driven by surplus inventory &ndash; mortgage holders&rsquo; equity levels continue to hit new heights. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, there is more outstanding mortgage debt today than at any point in history, but at the same time, overall market leverage remains near all-time lows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outstanding mortgage debt, including both first and second liens, hit an all-time high in June, but growth in home prices has outpaced that gradual rise in debt,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Total cumulative debt leverage &ndash; essentially a loan-to-value ratio for the entire mortgage market &ndash; is equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, the third lowest leverage ratio we&rsquo;ve seen in the past 20-plus years. Rising home prices have also continued to build the fortunes of existing homeowners, pushing tappable equity &ndash; the amount a mortgage holder can leverage while retaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; to its highest level ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine out of ten of mortgage holders (48.5M) have some degree of tappable equity. A fair representation of the addressable market for second lien lending, tappable equity continues to be held primarily by higher credit score borrowers with low first lien interest rates. Two-thirds of such equity is held by mortgage holders with credit scores of 760 or higher, with a similar share held by those with first lien rates below 4%.</p>
<p>Three out of five (32M) mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and 1.2M have $1M or more. Higher equity levels tend to correspond with lower first lien interest rates, as those borrowers, on average, were able to capitalize on record low interest rates while also buying into the market earlier at lower prices. The average first lien rate of borrowers without tappable equity is approximately 5.5%, nearly a full percentage point above those with up to $50K available to borrow against (4.45%). Borrowers with $50-$199K to borrow against have average first lien rates of just above 4%, while those with $500K or more to borrow against have average rates of around 3.75%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home equity lending has been sluggish since interest rates began their climb higher early in 2022,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;As the Fed raised short-term lending rates, accessing equity became more expensive for homeowners, evidenced by the anemic growth in such lending despite record levels of available, tappable equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Industry expectations that the Fed will soon begin easing short-term rates could gradually change that dynamic, given the more direct impact short term rates have on home equity rate offerings, and lenders would do well to prepare. The ability to originate and service home equity loans alongside first lien mortgages will be key &ndash; to say nothing of using data-driven portfolio analysis to identify potential second lien customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater on their mortgages nationwide, putting just 0.60% of active loans in a negative equity position, with another 4.2% holding less than 10% equity in their homes. That said, Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas.</p>
<p>In Austin, for example, home prices are more than 15% off 2022 peaks, resulting in some 2.6% of mortgage holders owing more than their homes are currently worth. Similarly, in San Antonio, 2.7% of homes are underwater. Negative equity rates are also rising in Florida, as Cape Coral, Lakeland, North Port and Jacksonville &ndash; where inventories have surged and home prices are softening &ndash; have all seen an increase in negative equity. The same is true of New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana. Nationwide, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in areas like San Antonio, Austin, Cape Coral and North Port, where prices have pulled back from recent highs.</p>

<title>Save The Date! ACER Workshop: Designing Electricity Network Tariffs To Fit The Energy Transition (30 September 2024)</title>

<div> workshop, tariffs, ACER, network, electricity<br>
Summary: 
ACER organizes a workshop on electricity tariffs, discussing dilemmas, solutions, and best practices, and collecting stakeholders' views. <div>
<p>Achieving the EU's climate and energy goals requires significant investment in new network capacities, which increases pressure on network tariffs. Meanwhile, the ongoing electrification and changing grid usage patterns challenge existing tariff designs.</p>
<p>In a decentralised and digitalised energy landscape, these challenges also present opportunities (such as more flexible users and increased automation). Cost-reflective and transparent tariffs can encourage efficient network connection and usage, reducing costs for users.</p>
<p>Setting tariffs is complex, with no &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; design, as regulators need to balance different principles and national specifics. Regulators and stakeholders can benefit from discussing challenges and sharing effective tariff solutions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the event about?</span></p>
<p>Every two years,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECAFSBFFUBUwNVAxSHVYKBgMdUFwHVhpRUVcDAwsNUw8AVFMdUFFVAgkFVlsdVg8NVR0GXwBXGgwHAAYZClZWUlMOBgBTUFoHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER reviews</a>&nbsp;national tariff practices and reports on methodologies and the most effective approaches.</p>
<p>Ahead of ACER&rsquo;s next electricity tariff report (early 2025), ACER organises a workshop to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the most pressing transmission and distribution tariff dilemmas;</li>
<li>debate potential solutions and best practices to address them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save the date &amp; get involved!</span></p>
<p>The workshop will take place on Monday, 30 September 2024 (14:00-17:00 CEST), in Brussels and online.</p>

<div> July, small business, consumer spending, retail, restaurant
Summary:<br>Small business sales rose 3.5% year-over-year and 1.3% month-over-month, with strong retail growth and declining restaurant sales. Utilities and hospitals were the fastest growing categories. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index rises to 141</i> </li>
<li><i>Small business sales grew 3.5% year-over-year, and 1.3% month-over-month</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade; for July 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and nature of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fiserv Small Business Index provides timely and granular insight into consumer spending at small businesses, which is often a bellwether for the broader economy,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;Following modest declines in June, consumer spending rebounded nicely in July to help many small businesses start the second half of the year strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for July rose to 141. This jump in consumer spending followed a four-point decline in June. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+3.5%) and transactions (+3.3%) grew compared to July 2023. Month-over-month small business sales grew (+1.3%) despite transactions slightly declining (-0.7%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending patterns continue to shift, most notably with Retail spend experiencing a decisive bounce back compared to June,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Specialty trade and professional services also performed very well due to seasonal demand and stabilizing inflation rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Retail</span></p>
<p>July saw strong retail spending growth as the national Retail index rose by four points to 146. Year-over-year retail sales (+4.6%) and transactions (+5.8%) increased and all retail subsectors showed growth compared to June. General Merchandise (+10.9%) led retail in yearly growth, followed by Health and Personal Care (+8.6%), Building Equipment and Garden Materials (+6.2%), Food and Beverage Retailers (+4.9) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.7%).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, retail sales (+2.5%) and transactions (+0.1%) grew as higher average ticket sizes drove short-term spending, even though foot traffic remained relatively flat. Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers (+4.8%) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.8%) led growth compared to June, followed by General Merchandise (+3.5%) and Health and Personal Care (+3.1%).</p>
<p><span>Restaurant</span></p>
<p>Food Services and Drinking<span>&nbsp;</span>Places<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 123 for July, a 4-point decline from June. On an annual basis, restaurant sales declined (-1.6%) despite seeing modest growth in foot traffic (+0.7%). Consumers dining out have also seen a significant decrease in average ticket size (-2.4%) compared to July 2023.</p>
<p>Month-over-month restaurant sales (-3.1%) and transactions (-1.4%) both decreased compared to June 2024, marking a second consecutive month of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Similar to the yearly trend, average ticket sizes also declined (-1.7%) on a monthly basis &ndash; indicating that consumers may be feeling some pricing relief when dining out.</p>
<p><span>Other Industry Movers</span></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services continue seeing significant growth in sales (+15.2%) and transactions (+13.9%) year-over-year. Month-over-month performance was strong as well with both total sales and transactions growing (+3.6%) compared to June. Gains in this industry were across a broad range of services, some of which saw increased demand following harsh weather events in June.</li>
<li>Specialty Trade Contractors grew sales (+5.7%) and transactions (+2.5%) year-over-year. Month-over-month sales (+3.0%) also rose despite total transactions (+0.1%) holding steady. Demand for air conditioning and related services drove most of the spending increase, along with broader demand for general construction and carpentry.</li>
<li>Additional year-over-year growth categories included Web Search, Libraries and Information Services (+20.4%), Amusement/Gambling/Recreation (+8.3%) and Food Manufacturing (+8.1%); the sharpest annual declines were in Real Estate (-12.3%) and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing (-10.5%).</li>
<li>Utilities (+6.2%) and Hospitals (+5.7%) were the fastest growing small business categories on a monthly basis; Performing Arts, Spectator Sports and Related Industries (-2.4%), Accommodation (-1.2%) and Insurance (-0.1%) each saw modest month-over-month declines.</li>

<div> electronic trading platform, fixed-income securities, trading volume, variable transaction fees, strategic priority<br />
Summary: MarketAxess Holdings Inc. reported 24.1% increase in total credit ADV in July 2024. Record portfolio trading ADV of $972 million and 35% Open Trading share. Preliminary FPM for total credit was $143. Rates ADV increased 32% year-over-year. U.S. credit market share declined. Municipal bond ADV increased by 65.2% and reached a record estimated market share of 8.6%. The preliminary variable transaction fees per million for total credit was approximately $143, down from $160 in the prior year. The total rates ADV was $22.3 billion, up 32.0% versus the prior year.  <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for July 2024.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;In July, we delivered 12% growth in total credit ADV, driven by an 18% increase in U.S. high-grade, an 18% increase in Eurobonds, a 7% increase in emerging markets and a 65% increase in Municipal bonds on record estimated market share. We also generated record portfolio trading ADV of $972 million. These strong results helped offset a decline in U.S. high-yield ADV. We are not pleased with the progression of U.S. credit market share in July, but we are encouraged by the prospect for potential increases in market volatility in the coming months. We believe that our strategy, including the expansion of our portfolio trading offering and dealer solutions, through the roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro to our global client base, will drive future market share expansion in U.S. credit.&rdquo;</p>

</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>London Property Investments (U.K) Limited (LPI) arranged mortgages while NPI Holdings Limited (NPI) bought properties and rented them back to the sellers, both without FCA authorisation. Daniel Stevens, the director of LPI and NPI, and his father, Tony Stevens, were also found liable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt described these breaches as &lsquo;serious contraventions, conducted over an extended period, involving high levels of culpability including deception of the consumers and the lenders, and which took advantage of the consumers&rsquo; vulnerability&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4 defendants are ordered to pay around &pound;4 million to the FCA. This is an important next step in the case. The FCA will need to recover funds before any compensation can be paid to affected individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LPI is required to remove restrictions registered against the titles of 4 properties. These restrictions were used to force individuals to pay exorbitant fees to LPI. If these fees were not paid, then the individual could not sell or re-mortgage their property. In some cases, this trapped individuals into high-interest bridging loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;&lsquo;These sham brokers preyed on vulnerable people who were struggling financially and trapped them with exorbitant fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The defendants used a smokescreen of deception which cost consumers and lenders dearly. This was a complex case, but the ruling shows that these were serious breaches of our rules. &nbsp;It is only right that we can now pursue LPI, NPI, Daniel and Tony Stevens to compensate for the losses they caused the victims.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div> MOU, ESG Data Platform, financing, collaboration, sustainability<br />
Summary:<br />
SET and EXIM Thailand collaborate to enhance sustainable finance, develop ESG-linked financing, and support businesses in achieving sustainability goals. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Thailand) to enhance the ecosystem for sustainable finance. This collaboration, under the ESG Data Linkage and Exchange Project, aims to leverage sustainability performance data of listed companies via the ESG Data Platform. In addition, the partnership will support the SET Carbon system for EXIM Thailand's clients to achieve sustainability goals, aligning with SET&rsquo;s commitment to driving all sectors towards sustainable growth.</p>

<div> Interoperability, Legal Entity Identifier, Financial Data Transparency Act, FDTA, data standards
Summary:<br /><br />Implementation of FDTA for financial data transparency examined for costs, benefits, and practicality, emphasizing public input and flexibility in rulemaking. <div>
<p>I support issuing this proposal, which is the first step in implementing the Financial Data Transparency Act (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), which seeks to enhance the accessibility, usefulness, and interoperability of data reported to federal financial regulators. Together with other US financial regulators, we are proposing joint data standards, which we will then apply to our respective rulebooks in agency-specific rulemakings.</p>
<p>If well implemented, the FDTA could enhance the analytical capability of regulators, investors, and other market participants and reduce compliance costs for regulated entities. However, this result is not guaranteed. Mangling implementation could result in costs disproportionate to the benefits. FDTA regulations, for example, could drive municipal issuers away from securities markets, prevent companies from going and staying public, or force the publication of unreliable data. To maximize the potential for the FDTA to serve the public interest, we need broad public input. I urge commenters to address the questions in the proposing release and my additional questions below, as well as to provide advance thoughts on the second, agency-specific, phase of the FDTA rulemaking process.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Costs and benefits</i>: The Commission did not conduct an economic analysis for this proposal, so I particularly welcome commenters&rsquo; input on the proposal&rsquo;s costs and benefits and the economic consequences of subsequent choices that individual agencies might make in their second phase rulemakings.<ol>
<li>Costs of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the total direct and indirect costs of adopting the contemplated data standards? Do these costs vary based on factors such as firm size or type of regulatory filing?</li>
<li>How have standardized data costs changed over time? Will these trends continue?</li>
<li>How much of the FDTA compliance burden is likely to stem from the one-time cost of setting up new data systems as opposed to ongoing compliance costs?</li>
<li>Will certain types of entities, such as municipal issuers, bear disproportionate FDTA-related costs? If so, what can we do to reduce those costs?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Benefits of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the potential benefits of FDTA implementation?</li>
<li>How could the Commission maximize the utility of financial regulatory information filed in compliance with the FDTA-mandated data standards? For example, should the Commission work to reduce error rates in structured data filings?</li>
<li>In light of the Commission&rsquo;s broad discretion in implementing the second phase of FDTA rulemaking, are there areas where full application of these proposed data standards would be particularly helpful or unhelpful?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Financial Data Interoperability.&nbsp;</i>The FDTA aims to promote the interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><ol>
<li>What could the benefits of interoperability be in the intermediate and longer term? What level of interoperability is necessary to achieve these benefits?</li>
<li>What are the largest hurdles to interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators? How should we address those hurdles?</li>
<li>How could we achieve the benefits of interoperability without imposing unnecessary costs on reporting firms, particularly smaller ones?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Legal Entity Identifier</i>: The FDTA mandates a &ldquo;common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license for all entities required to report to&rdquo; the regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The proposal specifies this standard as&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), which the Global LEI Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) manages and supports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><ol>
<li>Mandating the adoption of any product or service managed by a third-party carries risks, including the possibility that the third-party could use its regulatory-mandated advantage to, for example, raise fees inordinately, demand obtrusive information from registrants, or provide poor service. Is this a risk of the LEI mandate? If so, how can we mitigate this risk, or does the existing regulatory oversight of the GLEIF already adequately manage this risk?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Would timely obtaining and maintaining the required LEIs be manageable for small entities and for large entities with many subsidiaries?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>How would an LEI mandate integrate with other entity identifiers such as the Central Index Key (&ldquo;CIK&rdquo;), which identifies EDGAR filers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>CUSIP and FIGI</i>:&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>The proposal&rsquo;s scope designates as an identifier of financial instruments the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (&ldquo;FIGI&rdquo;), which is &ldquo;established by the Object Management Group . . . an open-membership standards consortium.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The joint rulemaking does not include the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedure (&ldquo;CUSIP&rdquo;), a common securities identifier, because CUSIP is &ldquo;proprietary and not available for open license in the United States.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><ol>
<li>Does the FDTA&rsquo;s statutory mandate extend to financial instruments?</li>
<li>Is the proposing release correct that the FIGI does and the CUSIP does not meet the FDTA&rsquo;s criteria for designation as a joint standard? If CUSIP does not now meet the criteria, what changes would enable it to do so?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>What, if any, policy issues arise from the FIGI being managed by a standards consortium?</li>
<li>How should the Commission consider FIGI and CUSIP in setting data standards for financial instruments in the second-phase rulemaking?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Scope of the data standards</i>: To implement the FDTA successfully, we need to scope it properly and remain within statutory parameters.<ol>
<li>Did the joint regulators strike the right balance when choosing the proposal&rsquo;s scope, in light of the statutory mandate?</li>
<li>What policy issues should the Commission consider when adapting its rulebook to conform to the joint data standards, particularly given the statutory discretion afforded to the Commission (and other implementing agencies) in the second-phase rulemaking?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Principles-based regulation and maintaining updated FDTA standards</i>: Hardwiring a technology into a rule runs the risk of preserving that requirement far after that technology&rsquo;s expiration date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;To benefit from FDTA implementation, we need meaningful consistency of data standards across agencies, which requires at least some specificity regarding data standards. If we are not vigilant, however, the FDTA could inhibit data standards from evolving over time or force firms to maintain parallel data systems. The proposal affords some flexibility in data transmission and schema and taxonomy format standards,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;while specifying other data standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><ol>
<li>Does the proposal strike the right balance between principles and prescription? If not, how should the approach change?</li>
<li>Would the balance the proposal strikes allow data standards to be updated in a timely manner? If not, what would work better?</li>
<li>How often should regulators revisit the mandated standards to ensure that they remain current? Should we build a requirement to revisit the standards into the final rule?</li>
<li>How, if at all, will artificial intelligence or other technologies influence the need for structured data? How should we take these potential future developments into account in implementing the FDTA?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed rule is a reasonable first step in the FDTA implementation journey. For this process to have the best chance of unlocking the FDTA&rsquo;s promise and avoiding its peril, public discussion is essential. I welcome commenters&rsquo; thoughts on these questions and how the second phase should unfold, particularly given the meaningful flexibility that the joint regulators will have during that phase.</p>
<p>Joint rulemakings are inevitably challenging. I therefore particularly appreciate the hard work of staff in the SEC&rsquo;s Divisions of Corporation Finance, Economic and Risk Analysis, Investment Management, and Trading and Markets, and in the Offices of the Chief Data Officer, Credit Ratings, the General Counsel, and Municipal Securities, along with staff at the other financial regulators who have worked on this first stage of FDTA implementation.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Data Standards, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<div> Joint Data Standards, LEI, FDTA, Commission, proposal
Summary:<br />The Commission proposes joint data standards, including LEI, for financial reporting, considering concerns over mandating payments to private organizations. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>As part of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Congress directed the Commission and other financial regulatory agencies to jointly propose data standards for (1) certain collections of information reported to each agency by financial entities and (2) the data collected from the agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint standards with the other agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;One part of the proposal establishes International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17442-1:2020, Financial Services &ndash; Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), as the joint standard for the legal entity identifier. While LEI satisfies the FDTA&rsquo;s requirements for a joint data standard, I have concerns were the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and other agencies to ultimately mandate the exclusive use of LEI from a specific organization.</p>
<p>LEI is managed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) and issued through &ldquo;local operating units&rdquo; (&ldquo;LOUs&rdquo;). Although GLEIF is overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee, of which the Commission is a member, neither the committee nor any LOU is a federal or state regulator. Entities must pay a fee to an LOU both to initially obtain an LEI and to renew the LEI annually.</p>
<p>While the fee may be&nbsp;<i>de minimis</i>&nbsp;to some entities, mandating payments to a private third party as a condition to satisfying legal requirements raises significant concerns &ndash; especially when such fees are not subject to approval by Congress or the Commission. If a company wants to raise capital by filing a registration statement, then it needs to first purchase an LEI from a third party.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;If a school or water district seeks to issue tax-exempt bonds to pay for infrastructure, then it needs to purchase an LEI before it can submit materials to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The FDTA amends section 124(c)(1)(A) of the Financial Stability Act to require the joint standards to include &ldquo;a common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The term &ldquo;open license&rdquo; means a legal guarantee that a data asset is made available at no cost to the public and with no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing, or adapting such asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Given these concerns, the Commission should consider alternatives to requiring regulated entities to pay for something &ndash; such as an LEI &ndash; if free alternatives, such as the Central Index Key (CIK) used to make EDGAR filings with the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;or the file number issued by the Delaware Department of State&rsquo;s Division of Corporations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;are available and may also satisfy the FDTA&rsquo;s data standard requirements. One option, consistent with certain of the Commission&rsquo;s forms,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;is to require an entity to use and disclose its LEI only if that entity has already obtained one for other purposes.</p>
<p>I look forward to reviewing the public comments from investors and market participants on the LEI requirement and other aspects of the proposal. In receiving feedback, I am particularly interested in whether the joint data standards being proposed, including LEI, can be obtained or used by non-traditional business organizations that exist today or that may exist in the future, such as those in the crypto and digital assets industry.</p>
<p>Because of the Congressional mandate to undertake this rulemaking, I will support the joint proposal. I thank staff from across the Commission who worked on this proposal, and I would especially like to recognize the staff of the Office of the Chief Data Officer, the Division of Corporation Finance, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis for their involvement and engagement with my staff and me.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Rulemaking, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Aug. 2, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint data standards for information collected by nine financial regulators (the &ldquo;Agencies&rdquo;). Through the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), Congress mandated that the Agencies propose such standards. In fulfilling the Congressional mandate, I&rsquo;m pleased to support this proposal, as it will make financial data collected by the Agencies more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public.</p>
<p>Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.</p>
<p>The proposal puts forward standards with regards to data identifiers, as well as ways to transmit and structure data.</p>
<p>First, with regards to identifiers, the Agencies propose a number of identifiers related to entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For instance, with regards to entities, the joint proposal would establish Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;) as a common entity identifier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, as it relates to geographic jurisdictions, the proposed joint standards use U.S. postal service abbreviations, as well as country codes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;With regard to products and instruments, the proposed joint standard uses three internationally recognized standards for financial instrument identifiers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>All of these common identifiers are non-proprietary and available under an open license.</p>
<p>Secondly, the joint proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to transmitting and structuring data. Under the proposal, any specific format (e.g., eXtensible Markup Language) that enables the structuring and transmission of high-quality, machine-readable data would be permitted.</p>
<p>In addition, Congress required in the FDTA that the joint data standards must, to the extent practicable, &ldquo;use, be consistent with, and implement applicable accounting and reporting principles&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the Agencies are seeking comment on whether to establish joint data standards regarding existing definitions of generally accepted accounting and financial reporting terms. Doing so would benefit both investors and the financial entities who report data.</p>
<p>Upon finalization of these joint standards, Congress has mandated that the SEC and certain other Agencies issue Agency-specific rules that implement the standards. In accordance with the FDTA, Agencies will be permitted flexibility in considering how best to implement the final joint standards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Department of the Treasury, Commodity Futures Trading Commission<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for working with the SEC on this joint rule.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Data Transparency Act, joint data standards, financial regulatory agencies, interoperability <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC proposes joint data standards for financial regulatory agencies to promote interoperability and enable high-quality, machine-readable data submission from financial institutions. <div>
<p>Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed joint data standards under the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 that would establish technical standards for data submitted to certain financial regulatory agencies. Eight additional agencies have proposed or are expected to propose the joint standards: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>The proposed joint standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the agencies by establishing common identifiers for entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proposal will make financial data more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, the proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to data transmission and schema and taxonomy formats, which would enable financial institutions to submit high-quality, machine-readable data to the agencies.</p>
<p>The agencies are in various stages of approving the proposed joint standards, with some agencies scheduled to vote in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The public comment period for the proposed joint standards will remain open for 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<div> resolution, IMF, Executive Directors, Sub-Saharan Africa, representation
Summary: IMF Board of Governors approved a resolution to add a 25th chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on the Executive Board, effective November 1, 2024. <div>
<p>On July 16, 2024, the IMF Board of Governors, the highest decision-making body of the IMF, issued a new resolution to increase the number of Executive Directors on the IMF&rsquo;s Executive Board by adding a 25th chair intended for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>This resolution follows the call, made by the International Monetary and Financial Committee during the 2023 Annual Meetings in Marrakech, for the creation of a 25th chair to improve Sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s voice and representation and the overall balance of regional representation at the Board (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/10/14/pr23353-chairs-statement-forty-eighth-meeting-of-the-imfc">See Press Release 23/353</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board of Governors have taken an important step towards creating an additional 25th&nbsp;chair at our Executive Board to increase Sub-Saharan Africa's representation in IMF decision making, to make our Board more inclusive, and to reflect the region's role in the global economy,&rdquo; said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approval by the Board of Governors to change the size of the Executive Board requires an 85 percent majority of the total voting power. The Fund&rsquo;s membership approved the resolution allowing for the creation of a 25th chair, exceeding the required threshold.</p>
<p>The new Executive Board of 25 Executive Directors will take office on November 1, 2024.</p>

<div> exemption, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Singapore, swap execution facility, regulation <br />
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance.<br />
Summary: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it unanimously approved an amended order that exempts two recognized market operators (RMOs) authorized within Singapore from CFTC swap execution facility (SEF) registration requirements. The exempted RMOs are FMX Securities (Singapore) Pte. Limited and LMAX Pte. Ltd.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Section 5h(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides that the CFTC may grant such an exemption if it finds that a foreign SEF is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in the facility&rsquo;s home country.&nbsp;</span>Likewise, t<span>he CFTC may revoke exempt status when a facility is no longer authorized and/or in good standing in its home country.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On March 13, 2019, the CFTC issued an order determining the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulatory framework for approved exchanges (AEs) and RMOs satisfies the standard in CEA section 5h(g) to exempt a SEF from registration with the CFTC. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7887-19"><span>7887-19</span></a><span>] Under the order, MAS agreed to, on an ongoing basis, request such exemptions for facilities meeting certain legal requirements within Singapore. MAS also agreed to notify the CFTC when an AE or RMO no longer satisfies those requirements and to request the non-compliant facility be removed from exempt status.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This amendment brings the total number of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/International/ForeignMarketsandProducts/ExemptSEFs#Singapore"><span>exempted AEs and RMOs</span></a>&nbsp;<span>to 18.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>"Cboe reported another strong quarter with record net revenue of $514 million, diluted EPS of $1.33, and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $2.15, up a robust 21% from the second quarter of 2023," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "The second quarter results illustrate the durability of the Cboe business model with year-to-date net revenue increasing by a strong 8% and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;coming in 17% higher as compared to first half 2023 levels. I am incredibly pleased with the progress we continue to make as we work through our strategic review, the early output of which is evidenced by our solid expense management trends, improved year-over-year EBITDA margins, and additive capital allocation actions with $90 million of share repurchases during the second quarter and a total of $180 million for the first half of the year. Each component of our exchange ecosystem performed well during the second quarter, and we are well positioned for the second half of the year."</p>
<p>"Cboe reported strong 10% year-over-year net revenue growth in the second quarter as each category of our business posted solid year-over-year trends," said Jill Griebenow, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. "Cash and Spot Markets performance was robust with net revenues growing 15% during the second quarter of 2024. Derivative trends were also solid, up 11% year-over-year, and Data and Access Solutions delivered 5% year-over-year net revenue growth. Notably, adjusted EBITDA margins<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;reached 67% through the first half of 2024, up more than two percentage points as compared to the first half of 2023, and we returned nearly $300 million in capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Moving forward, we anticipate organic total net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to finish in the 6-8% range, up from our prior guidance of the higher end of 5-7%. We are reaffirming our Data and Access Solutions organic net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of 7-10%, but anticipate finishing at the lower end of the guidance range. Additionally, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted operating expense guidance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of $795 to $805 million. We have produced strong results for the first half of 2024 and look forward to delivering durable returns for shareholders in the quarters ahead."</p>

<li>Total operating expenses were $303.7 million versus $222.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $81.4 million, primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets recognized in the Digital reporting unit. Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $197.1 million increased 2 percent compared to $192.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services, partially offset by a decline in travel and promotional expenses.</li>
<li>The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 30.8 percent as compared with 30.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to the valuation allowance associated with the impairment of the Globacap investment.

<p><b>Options:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Options net revenue of $306.7 million was up $23.5 million, or 8 percent, from the second quarter of 2023. Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased primarily as a result of a 9 percent increase in index options trading volumes versus the second quarter of 2023. Access and capacity fees and market data fees were 3 percent higher than the second quarter 2023.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased $27.3 million, or 11 percent, reflecting a 1 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV") and a 9 percent increase in total options RPC compared to the second quarter 2023. The increase in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a higher percentage of total options volume.</li>
<li>Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 31.2 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 33.3 percent in the second quarter of 2023, a result of lower multi-list market share as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>

<p><b>North American (N.A.) Equities:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>N.A. Equities record net revenue of $98.3 million increased $7.5 million, or 8 percent versus the second quarter of 2023, reflecting higher net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>, proprietary market data fees, and access and capacity fees.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased by $7.0 million, or 25 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by stronger U.S. exchange and off-exchange net capture rates, as well as stronger volumes and market share in Canadian Equities as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>
<li>Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 11.4 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 12.7 percent in the second quarter of 2023 given higher off-exchange and closing auction share. Cboe's U.S. Equities off-exchange market share was 17.8 percent, down from 19.9 percent in the second quarter of 2023 as overall industry alternative trading systems ("ATS") market share declined as a percentage of off-exchange share.

European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was &euro;9.6 billion, up 4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2023 given a 10 percent increase in industry market volumes, partially offset by lower market share. Japanese Equities ADNV was 71 percent higher and Australian Equities ADNV was 12 percent higher than the second quarter of 2023.</li>
<li>For the second quarter of 2024, Cboe European Equities had 22.5 percent market share, down from 23.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Total market share was negatively impacted by elevated closing auction activity on listing venues and lower lit book market share. Cboe European Equities net capture rate increased 9 percent given a mix shift to higher capture products. Cboe Australia had 20.8 percent market share for the second quarter of 2024, up from 18.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Cboe Japan grew market share to 5.5 percent in the second quarter of 2024 from 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2023.</li>

<div> Westminster magistrates court, Peterson Okoh, mortgage fraud, FCA, unauthorized activities
Summary:
Westminster magistrates court hearing alleged mortgage fraud by Peterson Okoh, accused of unauthorized activities and false representation, sent to trial. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Peterson Okoh (of Peckham, London SE15) appeared in Westminster magistrates court on 31 July 2024 for allegedly advising on and arranging mortgages, between January 2018 and December 2023, without being authorised.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also alleges a significant number of mortgage applications advised on and arranged by Mr Okoh contained false information and/or were supported by forged documents.</p>
<p>Mr Okoh has been charged by the FCA with 3 counts of fraud by false representation and 1 count of carrying on regulated activities without authorisation. Mr Okoh has pleaded not guilty to all counts.</p>
<p>The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 28 August 2024.</p>
<p>Peterson Okoh has been released on conditional bail with conditions of home residence, not to carry on acting as a mortgage advisor while unauthorised, and not to contact prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly pending his next appearance.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of Birth: Peterson Okoh (01/10/1960)</li>
<li>The most obvious example of a 'regulated mortgage contract'&nbsp;is a loan made to an individual to enable the individual to buy a home for themselves where the loan is secured on that home. For legal definition of a 'regulated mortgage contract',&nbsp;please refer to Article 61(3)(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001.</li>
<li>Carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation is contrary to section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and is punishable by a fine or up to 2 years in prison.</li>
<li>Fraud by False Representation is contrary to section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 and is punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Okoh has been charged with: 
<ul>
<li>3 counts of fraud by false representation; and</li>
<li>1 count of breaching s19 FSMA</li>

<div> Expansion, Dormant Assets Scheme, Charities, Social Enterprises, Financial Assets
Summary:<br /><br />Millions in dormant funds unlocked for charities and social enterprises, supporting UK growth. FCA facilitates expansion of Dormant Assets Scheme to empower local businesses. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>We have amended our rules and guidance to enable dormant investment assets and client money to be available to the Dormant Assets Scheme (DAS).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Millions in dormant funds have been unlocked for charities and social enterprises, as new rules set out today facilitate the expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme.&nbsp;<span>This second phase of the expansion will bring dormant investment assets and client money in scope.</span></p>
<p>Led by industry and backed by government, the Dormant Asset scheme aims to reunite people with their financial assets. Where that is not possible, this money supports UK growth through good causes such as getting young people into work or offering affordable credit to families.</p>
<p>Since 2011, the UK Dormant Assets Scheme has unlocked more than &pound;745m for social and environment initiatives, from over &pound;1.35 billion in dormant bank and building society accounts. The expansion of the scheme is estimated to potentially unlock a further &pound;880m.</p>
<p>This initiative not only reunites people with their lost money but also empowers local businesses to drive positive change across local communities.</p>
<p>The policy statement outlines technical changes in our Handbook to facilitate the full expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme in the remaining expanded asset classes. The FCA&rsquo;s intention is to ensure any Handbook changes allow firms to participate in the Dormant Assets Scheme and consumers to access reclaims.</p>

Iress acquired the Mortgages business over 10 years ago, during which time it has become a leading provider of mortgage origination software in the UK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group CEO, Marcus Price, said</span></strong><span>: &ldquo;This is the fourth and largest divestment we have successfully executed under our transformation program. The net proceeds of all divestments have been used to retire debt, with our debt to leverage ratio seeing considerable improvement - paving the way for a return to maintainable dividends. As we enter the final months of our transformation program, we can already see a stronger Iress with an improved earnings profile, balance sheet strength and execution discipline priming Iress for future growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group Executive - Wealth &amp; UK, Harry Mitchell</span></strong><span>, said: &ldquo;Completion of the sale was contingent on the novation of existing MSO client contracts to the new owners and we&rsquo;re pleased to have gained the full support of all Mortgages clients. We are confident this is a great result not only for Iress, but also for our clients and people, with Bain Capital fully committed to re-investing in the technology and capabilities that power MSO. Iress&rsquo; UK operations now have a streamlined focus on its core competencies, and we remain committed to driving excellence for our clients in the UK.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Net proceeds from the sale are expected to be approximately &pound;75m ($A147m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>). Iress will provide support services for a period of up to 12 months after the transaction on a cost recovery basis to ensure a smooth transition.</span></p>

<title>ASX Commences Final Of Two Consultations To Decide Scope And Implementation For CHESS Replacement</title>

<div> consultation, ASX, CHESS replacement, settlement cycle, T+1
Summary:<br />ASX consults on CHESS replacement and T+1 settlement cycle, proposes implementation in 2026 and 2029, seeks stakeholder feedback by September 2024.<br /> <div>
<p>ASX today released a public consultation paper which proposes the CHESS replacement settlement and subregister services be implemented in 2029. The paper is the second of two consultations undertaken by ASX this year to gather industry feedback on scope and implementation for the project to replace Australia&rsquo;s cash equities clearing and settlement system (CHESS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also today, ASX published its summary of feedback received on the industry whitepaper it released in April that sought input on a potential move to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1.</p>
<p>Taken together, these papers underscore the ongoing stakeholder engagement ASX has been undertaking to ensure it continues to work closely with industry on the delivery of CHESS replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance</b> said &ldquo;Our commitment to transparent and collaborative consultation is central to the success of the CHESS replacement project as well as Australia&rsquo;s approach to T+1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposal to implement CHESS replacement across two main releases reflects how we&rsquo;ve listened to industry feedback. The staged approach to implementation, where we are delivering the clearing services first in Release 1, followed by delivery of settlement, subregister and additional clearing enhancements in Release 2 is designed to manage several factors, including materially reducing delivery risk and allowing for industry readiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stakeholder input provided via working groups and other forums is incorporated in the consultation paper published today and is reflected as part of the functional scope of Release 2. Industry driven improvements outlined in the consultation paper include items such as continuous netting, account segregation and corporate action elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to the industry whitepaper on T+1 settlement were also a key input into the consultation paper, helping inform the proposed sequencing of CHESS replacement implementation stages and the potential move to T+1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of responses from industry suggest a clear preference to avoid implementing T+1 at the same time as Release 2 of CHESS replacement,&rdquo; Mr Triance said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In light of the feedback received to the industry whitepaper and having regard to the experiences of transitioning to T+1 in other markets we have presented a number of options on timing to transition to T+1 in Australia, and outlined the risks and benefits of each of the options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a decision is made to move to T+1, the paper recommends the option where that would take place at an appropriate time after the implementation of CHESS replacement Release 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX confirmed in June that the delivery of Release 1 is expected to occur in H1 2026. This consultation paper proposes that Release 2 be delivered in 2029, aligning with indicative timeframes previously communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Next steps in consultation process</b></h4>
<p>We encourage feedback from CHESS users and software providers (including both external vendors and CHESS users developing in-house systems), as well as other interested stakeholders on the proposals outlined in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASX is seeking stakeholder feedback by Friday, 13 September 2024. ASX will then take time to review submissions and proposes to provide a consultation response paper in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p>CHESS is the clearing and settlement system for Australia&rsquo;s cash equities market. ASX is undertaking a project to replace CHESS and in November 2023 ASX announced it would proceed with a product based solution design for CHESS replacement that would be delivered by global technology provider TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).&nbsp;</p>

Summary: The MAS has set up a Review Group to strengthen Singapore's equities market, focusing on market challenges, listings, regulatory enhancements, and stakeholder participation. <br /><br /> <div>

<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced that a Review Group has been set up to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore. The Review Group will be chaired by Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister for Finance and Board Member of MAS, and comprise key private sector stakeholders and public sector representatives.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>A dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain, alongside Singapore&rsquo;s growing private equity and venture capital ecosystem. A deep and liquid public equities market enables companies to access capital as they expand regionally and globally. It also allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies. Improving the attractiveness of Singapore&rsquo;s equities market can therefore enhance Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub. This in turn complements Singapore&rsquo;s innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Government has introduced various initiatives to support enterprise financing and enhance Singapore&rsquo;s equities markets. These include the set-up of cornerstone funds to support initial public offerings of high-growth companies, introduction of corporate structures and share classes to facilitate such listings, and measures to improve research coverage.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will build on these efforts to position Singapore&rsquo;s equities market for growth. The Group will consider additional initiatives to improve the vibrancy of our equities market, and study ways to galvanise greater private sector participation in this effort, including from capital market intermediaries, investors, and listed companies. The Review Group will be supported by two workstreams:</p>
<p>a. The Enterprise and Markets workstream will aim to address market challenges, foster listings, and facilitate market revitalisation; and<br />b. The Regulatory workstream will focus on enhancing the regulatory regime to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.<br /><br />The Terms of Reference and composition of the Review Group are set out in Annex A.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Through the two workstreams, the review process will involve stakeholders with expertise and experience in diverse fields in the capital markets, including corporate finance, investment banking, asset management, legal services, and corporate governance. The Review Group will recommend a set of measures to strengthen the Singapore equities market and complete its report within 12 months.<br /><br /></p>

<title>ASIC’s First Greenwashing Case Results In Landmark $11.3 Million Penalty For Mercer</title>

<div> Penalty, Greenwashing, Financial Services Industry, ESG Claims, Mercer Superannuation<br />
Summary:<br />
- Mercer Superannuation fined $11.3 million for misleading ESG claims<br />
- ASIC's first greenwashing case for financial services industry<br />
- Found to have made misleading statements about sustainable investment options<br />
- Importance of accurate ESG claims highlighted<br />
- Additional cases and infringement notices issued for alleged greenwashing practices<br /> <div>
<p>In a landmark case for ASIC, the Federal Court has ordered Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited to pay a $11.3 million penalty after it admitted it made misleading statements about the sustainable nature and characteristics of some of its superannuation investment options.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, 'This was ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case brought before the Federal Court; a landmark case both for ASIC and for the financial services industry. It demonstrates the importance of making accurate ESG claims to investors and potential investors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court found Mercer made misleading statements on its website about seven &lsquo;Sustainable Plus&rsquo; investment options offered by the Mercer Super Trust, of which Mercer is the trustee. These statements marketed the Sustainable Plus options as suitable for members who &lsquo;are deeply committed to sustainability&rsquo; because they excluded investments in companies involved in carbon intensive fossil fuels like thermal coal. Exclusions were also stated to apply to companies involved in alcohol production and gambling.</p>
<p>The Court found members who took up the Sustainable Plus options had investments in companies involved in industries the website statements said were excluded, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 companies involved in the extraction or sale of carbon intensive fossil fuels (including AGL Energy Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Glencore PLC and Whitehaven Coal Ltd),</li>
<li>15 companies involved in the production of alcohol (including Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, Carlsberg AS, Heineken Holding NV and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd), and</li>
<li>19 companies involved in gambling (including Aristocrat Leisure Limited, Caesar&rsquo;s Entertainment Inc, Crown Resorts Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;s matter is a strong example to the financial services industry of the greenwashing action we will take. We will continue to monitor the market for ESG-related claims that cannot be validated by evidence to ensure the market is fair and transparent,&rsquo; Ms Court added.</p>
<p>When handing down his decision Justice Horan remarked, &lsquo;The contraventions admitted by Mercer are serious. They arose from failures by Mercer to implement adequate systems to ensure that ESG claims in relation to its superannuation products were accurate, and to monitor and enforce the application of any sustainability exclusions associated with such ESG claims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Horan also commented: &lsquo;&hellip;it is vital that consumers in the financial services industry can have confidence in ESG claims made by providers of financial products and services.  As is the case in many other industries, consumers may place great importance on ESG considerations when making investment decisions. Any misrepresentations in relation to ESG policies or practices associated with financial products or services, whether as an aspect of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; practices or otherwise, undermines that confidence to the detriment of consumers and the industry generally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mercer Super has agreed to pay ASIC&rsquo;s costs.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Strike Force, unfair pricing, illegal pricing, anticompetitive practices
Summary:
SEC Chair addresses the mission of the SEC, enforcement actions against unfair pricing, rulemaking projects, market oversight, and the potential impact of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good afternoon. I&rsquo;m honored to take part in the first meeting of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>As President Joe Biden said at our most recent Competition Council meeting with him, if you are &ldquo;engaging in illegal practices that are fraudulent or unfair or deceptive or anti-competitive &hellip; we will enforce the law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain that which sits in the middle: fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Thus, guarding against deceptive, fraudulent, or anticompetitive practices is at the heart of what we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>When Congress established the SEC 90 years ago, they embedded antifraud provisions in our key statutes. Congress gave us additional authorities in the 1970s to promote competition and guard against anticompetitive practices when the word competition was added to our statute 20 times.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC pursues these important mandates from Congress every day in overseeing the more than $110 trillion capital markets.</p>
<p>As President Biden further said when announcing the Strike Force, capitalism without competition is not capitalism.</p>
<p>The SEC addresses unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive business practices in all of our work, through enforcement, rulemaking, and market oversight.</p>
<p>The SEC, working through its Enforcement Division, is the cop on the beat for the securities markets. The Commission brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, resulting in $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;While there are many cases related to fraud or unfair practices, I&rsquo;ll highlight three that directly relate to unfair and illegal pricing. Earlier this year we settled an action against TIAA-CREF for making recommendations to retail customers while failing to disclose that substantially equivalent lower-cost shares were available.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we settled a case against Wells Fargo for overcharging advisory accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In 2022, we charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries for not disclosing they were sweeping cash to its affiliate bank, loaning it out, and then keeping the difference between the interest earned on the loans and what it paid in interest to clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through rulemaking projects, works to enhance competition across all three parts of our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;We do so by promoting transparency, access, and fair dealing in the markets. Among the most important projects are focusing on promoting greater competition and access in the $27 trillion U.S. treasury markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;as well as the more than $50 trillion equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through our market oversight, examines registrants. We review the tens of thousands of filings we receive every year from broker-dealers, investment advisers, stock exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory organizations, and issuers. As we conduct such oversight, we stay true to the mandates Congress laid out to guard against fraud and deceptive practices and promote competition.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to mention what may be one of the most transformative technologies&mdash;not only for this time but perhaps our lives, artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This technology offers tremendous promise for individuals and our economy. At the same time, all of our agencies will be pressed to grapple with what this technology means when it comes to guarding against deception, fraud, and anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>As it relates to the securities markets, bad actors might seek to use AI to deceive or defraud the public, investors, and the market. Make no mistake, though, under the securities laws, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>As it relates to the potential for anticompetitive behavior, we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere in our economy that one or a small number of tech platforms can come to dominate a field. Due to cost, reach, and network economics, we may see the same come to pass in the fields of AI and related data aggregation. Further, bad actors might try to use AI to game the system and signal to competitors about pricing or otherwise to undermine competition.</p>
<p>I look forward to collaborating with others here on these important matters.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Calls For Amending Federal Bankruptcy Law To Protect Canadian Investors</title>

<div> Supreme Court of Canada, BCSC, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, financial sanctions, Poonians
<br />
The BCSC seeks changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after the Supreme Court ruled that financial penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy. The court ruled in favor of BCSC's disgorgement orders but against administrative penalties. BCSC has had over 40 debts extinguished through bankruptcy since 2001. The BCSC is calling for a revision of the law to address this loophole.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The BCSC is calling for changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after a Supreme Court ruling regarding financial penalties and bankruptcy. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is calling for changing the federal&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some financial sanctions can be extinguished through the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>The court, in a 5-2&nbsp;<a href="https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/20555/index.do" target="_blank">decision</a>, said that administrative penalties, which are imposed by the BCSC and other Canadian securities regulators to deter future misconduct, can be eliminated from a person&rsquo;s debt upon being discharged from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case demonstrates one of the many challenges securities regulators face in collecting financial penalties from lawbreakers,&rdquo; said BCSC Chair &amp; CEO Brenda Leong. &ldquo;The fact that administrative penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy seriously undermines securities regulators&rsquo; duty to protect investors, and highlights a significant flaw in federal bankruptcy law that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruling came in litigation between the BCSC and a B.C. couple, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian. A BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2014/73-bcsc-panel-finds-that-five-bc-residents-engaged-in-market-manipulation" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;that they ran a pump-and-dump scheme involving an Ontario company whose shares traded on the TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel concluded that the Poonians inflated the company&rsquo;s share price through trading among themselves, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and then illegally obtained approximately $7 million by selling shares to unsuspecting buyers, many of them living paycheck to paycheck. Most of them had no idea they were victims of misconduct until they were contacted by the BCSC.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel levied two types of financial sanctions against the Poonians:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative penalties of $13.5 million, intended to deter future misconduct by the Poonians and others who might contemplate committing similar wrongdoing</li>
<li>Disgorgement of $5.6 million, representing the amount the Poonians obtained from their illegal activity. Any funds collected for disgorgement orders can be returned to victims of that misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Poonians have not made any effort to pay. After the BCSC imposed its sanctions, they filed for bankruptcy. The Poonians asked the B.C. Supreme Court to extinguish their debts, including those owed to the BCSC but that request &ndash; which was opposed by the BCSC &ndash; was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2020/33-bc-couple-owing-19-million-to-bcsc-must-remain-in-bankruptcy" target="_blank">denied</a>&nbsp;by the court in 2020.</p>
<p>The BCSC also applied to the court for an order that its financial sanctions against the Poonians persist, even if all of the couple&rsquo;s other debts are extinguished through bankruptcy, because the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;allows some types of debts to survive bankruptcy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debts arising from a fine, penalty or restitution order imposed by a court, and</li>
<li>Debts arising by obtaining property or services by false pretenses or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCSC argued that its sanctions &ndash; both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders &ndash; met those criteria.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously agreed with the BCSC that &ldquo;the Poonians&rsquo; scheme to mislead and exploit investors amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation.&rdquo; But it did not agree that the sanctions, despite being registered with a court, qualified as court-imposed orders.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s five-member majority said there is a direct link between the amounts of the disgorgement orders and the Poonians&rsquo; fraudulent conduct, so those debts to the BCSC survive bankruptcy. But the administrative penalties, the majority said, arose most directly from the BCSC&rsquo;s decision to sanction the couple, and only indirectly from the Poonians&rsquo; unlawful conduct. So those penalties, the majority said, are extinguished if the Poonians exit bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two justices dissented, saying that the administrative penalties, along with disgorgement, should persist to &ldquo;ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that the Poonians, as a result of this decision, will forever owe $5.6 million, which represents the money they obtained from their pump-and-dump scheme,&rdquo; Leong said. &ldquo;However, this has always been about more than this one case, and we are disappointed that people who cheat or swindle investors can avoid paying administrative penalties through an exit from bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2001, more than 40 individuals and companies, owing a total of about $80 million to the BCSC, have gone through bankruptcy, and as a result, have had their BCSC debts extinguished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its written opinion, said that Parliament could have drafted the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;to expressly say that financial sanctions of regulatory bodies or administrative tribunals are exempt from bankruptcy discharge. But the Act does not say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An obvious solution is to revise the law to deal with this &lsquo;escape hatch,&rsquo;&rdquo; Leong said.</p>

<title>The EBA And ECB Release A Joint Report On Payment Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-and-ecb-release-a-joint-report-on-payment-fraud/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-and-ecb-release-a-joint-report-on-payment-fraud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) published today a joint Report on payment fraud data. The report assesses payment fraud reported by the industry across the European Economic Areas (EEA), which amounted to &euro;4.3bn in 2022 and &euro;2.0bn in the first half of 2023. The Report confirms the beneficial impact of strong customer authentication (SCA) on fraud levels.</span></p>
<p>The Report examines the total number of payment transactions and the subset of fraudulent transactions in terms of value and volume. In addition to the aggregated values, the Report also presents data based on volumes and also sorted by type of payment instruments, i.e. credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals, and e-money transactions.</p>
<p>SCA-authenticated transactions featured lower fraud rates than non-SCA transactions, especially for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes. Furthermore, fraud shares for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes, were 10 times higher when the counterpart is located outside the EEA, where the application of SCA is not legally required and may therefore not have been requested. Hence, the report confirms the beneficial impact of the SCA requirements that were introduced by the PSD2 and the supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj">technical standards</a>&nbsp;that the EBA had issued in 2018 in close cooperation with the ECB.</p>
<p>The Report also finds that losses due to frauds were distributed differently among liability bearers depending on the payment instrument.</p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB will continue to monitor fraud data and going forward, will publish the aggregate data on an annual basis. This initial rReport presents observations in a descriptive way, while future editions will also include explanations of the data and observed trends.</p>
<p><span>Background and legal basis</span></p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB, in their respective roles as supervisory authority of payment service providers and overseer of payment systems, instruments, schemes and arrangements, closely monitor developments in payment fraud. Both the EBA and the ECB thereby rely on statistical information on the volumes and values of payment transactions and corresponding fraud reported by payment service providers (PSPs) located in the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 96(6) of PSD2, PSPs are required to report statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities (NCAs). NCAs, in turn, are required to provide both the EBA and the ECB with this data in aggregated form. In support of these provisions, the EBA Guidelines on fraud reporting under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2018/05, hereafter &ldquo;EBA Guidelines&rdquo;), which apply since 1 January 2019, specify the data that should be reported under the PSD2. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 1409/2013 of the European Central Bank on payments statistics (ECB/2013/43), as amended (hereafter &lsquo;ECB Regulation on payments statistics&rsquo;), requires PSPs located in the euro area to report inter alia detailed information on payment fraud to their national central banks, which in turn shall share the data in aggregated form with the ECB. &nbsp;Data under both the EBA Guidelines and the ECB Regulation on payments statistics is reported on a semi-annual basis.&nbsp;<br />This Report, jointly prepared by the EBA and the ECB, presents a comprehensive overview of the latest data collected under the above-mentioned frameworks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISI Markets, the leading provider of macroeconomic data, industry, company and sovereign intelligence, today announces the acquisition of EPFR, the global leader in fund flows and allocation data.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of EPFR, ISI Markets gains a proprietary macro funds flow dataset and proposition, reinforcing ISI&rsquo;s strategy of curating and delivering difficult-to-source &ldquo;macro to micro&rdquo; data, helping inform buy- and sell-side firms&rsquo; strategies and investment decisions across global markets, including on the world&rsquo;s fastest growing and highest potential economies.</p>
<p>EPFR, which is renowned for its breadth, granularity, and frequency of global fund flows coverage, will operate alongside ISI Markets&rsquo; leading global macroeconomic and financial market data business, CEIC. Combining the firms&rsquo; offerings provides ISI Markets&rsquo; clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and banks, comprehensive data and insight on investor sentiment and money movements across regions and asset classes, whilst streamlining workflows and enhancing investment models for economists, quantitative analysts and investment professionals with the tightest integration of datasets.</p>
<p>Steve Pulley, CEO of ISI Markets, commented: &ldquo;The strategic acquisition of EPFR marks a pivotal step in the evolution of ISI Markets. Bringing greater scale in terms of breadth of buy- and sell-side relationships across North America and Europe and material expansion of our proprietary data asset, ISI Markets is now positioned as a unique global data and intelligence platform providing excellent coverage of developed markets whilst remaining best in breed on emerging markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pascal Ambrosi, Partner at Montagu, commented: &ldquo;This acquisition reflects the strong synergy that has developed between EPFR and ISI Markets over time, as the two became truly global service providers with a strategic focus on more deeply supporting buy- and sell-side client workflows. The transaction will also enable the companies to expand their geographic reach and tap into markets in North America/Europe and Asia respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acquisition follows the partnership announced earlier this year which saw ISI Markets integrate EPFR fund flows and asset allocation data across all major asset classes, tracking over 150,000 traditional and alternative fund-share classes, into CEIC&rsquo;s workflow and analytics platform. By combining EPFR's data with over 3,500 other economic and financial data sources, the combined offering has equipped investment professionals with the ability to better understand the linkages between economic factors, investor sentiment and asset class performance.</p>
<p>EPFR was carved out from Informa PLC by Montagu in October 2022 and is the second acquisition by ISI Markets since Montagu acquired ISI in December 2020 and follows the acquisition of REDD Intelligence, the leading emerging market corporate and sovereign intelligence provider for high yield, private credit, distressed and event-driven special situations.&nbsp; ISI Markets also offers EMIS, the award-winning AI powered market intelligence and research platform.</p>
