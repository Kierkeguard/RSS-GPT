Summary:
The SET and maiA have launched the eighth annual SET Social Impact GYM to develop essential business skills for Social Enterprises, encouraging collaboration. Over 80 SEs have been empowered. Job creation, education, health and environmental benefits have resulted. <br><br>Summary: <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), celebrating its 50th anniversary, has collaborated with the mai Listed Company Association (maiA) to launch the eighth annual SET Social Impact GYM 2024, a bootcamp for social enterprises coached by successful entrepreneurs and business people. Joined by three new alliance partners, the initiative aims to strengthen Social Enterprises (SEs) by developing essential business skills and fostering connections with the private sector, thereby broadening opportunities for collaboration in creating concrete social impact.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b> said that SET has promoted sustainable business practices with a focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. SET is committed to being exemplary in following ESG principles to ensure the sustainability of Thailand's capital market. One of the key sustainability strategies is to equip social entrepreneurs with entrepreneurial skills through the SET Social Impact GYM, launched in 2017 in collaboration with maiA, a primary partner providing volunteer coaches who share invaluable business insights.</p>
<p>This year's program is further strengthened by three new partners: The Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth), which will share networks and knowledge with the project's participants; The Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation (TCG), which will provide insights on financial planning and preparedness for seeking funding sources; and PwC Thailand, which will offer expert advice on taxation and accounting-related matters.</p>
<p>The program welcomes 10 intensively selected SEs, covering four crucial social impact areas: community and agricultural development (three SEs), healthcare (three SEs), environment (three SEs), and vulnerable groups (one SE). Most participants have at least three to five years of business experience and are at the growth stage. However, they still lack business skills necessary for further sustainable growth."</p>
<p>Over the past seven years, the SET Social Impact GYM has empowered more than 80 SEs, equipping them with clear strategic plans and business directions for immediate implementation and expansion. The program has also facilitated Business Co-Creation opportunities between SEs and the private sector in various aspects, resulting in job creation, product and service promotion, sales channel support, and business mentorship.</p>
<p>The impact of this initiative is far-reaching, having created careers for over 114,000 vulnerable individuals, farmers, and community members. It has also enhanced educational opportunities for more than 8,000 people, addressed health issues for about 6,000 individuals, and implemented environmental solutions benefiting over 110,000 people.</p>

<title>ASIC Prosecutes 78 Individuals For Failing To Assist Registered Liquidators</title>

<div> prosecuted, individuals, liquidators, ASIC, obligations
Summary:<br />ASIC prosecuted 78 individuals for failing to assist liquidators, resulting in fines of over $430,000. Corporate insolvencies rising, individuals failing to meet obligations. Enforcement action taken. Registered liquidators can report misconduct. <br /> <div>
<p>ASIC has prosecuted 78 individuals for failing to assist registered liquidators over the six months from 1 January to 30 June 2024.</p>
<p>These enforcement actions followed the failure of company officers and other individuals to provide registered liquidators with access to company books and submit a report on company activities and property (ROCAP).</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;In the first six months of this year ASIC prosecuted 78 individuals for 146 offences under the Corporations Act for failing to assist liquidators, with fines of more than $430,000 imposed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Corporate insolvencies have continued to rise over the last 12 months. It is important that individuals assist liquidators by meeting their statutory obligations to minimise the impact of a company&rsquo;s failure on creditors. ASIC continues to prosecute those who frustrate the winding up of a company by not submitting reports and providing company books required.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The individuals involved were prosecuted summarily in Local and Magistrates&rsquo; Courts by ASIC and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before undertaking a prosecution, ASIC gives individuals an opportunity to comply with their statutory obligations to assist registered liquidators and avoid prosecution. ASIC will then take enforcement action if individuals continue to prevent liquidators from having access to company books and ROCAP.</p>
<p>Registered liquidators can report misconduct via the Liquidator Assistance Program.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Innovation And Market Structure</title>

<div> Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, CFTC, market structure, innovation, roundtable<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Commissioner Pham calls for public engagement on market structure innovation. Emphasizes need for understanding and preparation through roundtable discussions. <div>
<p><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham is renewing calls for open public engagement by the CFTC on evolving trends and innovation in market structure. Her statement comes as the CFTC approved Kalshi Klear LLC&rsquo;s registration as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt that we are seeing a renaissance in markets, ushered in by new technology that enables direct access and continuous all-to-all trading. What and how participants can buy, sell or trade&mdash;and with who&mdash;is changing rapidly. These new products and markets present new opportunities that are more accessible to more people, as well as risks.&nbsp; As U.S. regulators, we must recognize the trends in democratization of markets or we will be left behind.&nbsp;It is time for the Commission to take a forward-looking approach to prepare for the future by developing a robust administrative record with studies, data, expert reports, and public input.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;It is imperative that we fully understand these shifts in market structure to determine how best to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants. I urge the Commission to support my recent proposal to hold a CFTC staff roundtable and invite input from industry leaders, market participants, other experts, and public interest groups to examine the issues presented by innovation in market structure such as direct access for both trading and clearing, increased retail participation, and new types of products.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;A CFTC staff roundtable is open and transparent and will provide the Commission with the best information and latest data to safeguard our markets while allowing innovation to flourish. The CFTC has successfully held many similar roundtables for decades as a best practice to address changes in the derivatives markets. Adopting a holistic approach to evolving market trends, rather than relying on ad hoc enforcement or registration orders, will help to establish clear rules of the road that promote responsible innovation and strengthen American competitiveness on a global stage.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it awarded over $4 million to an insider whistleblower who provided information that&nbsp;led the&nbsp;Division of Enforcement (DOE)&nbsp;to open an investigation into ongoing misconduct. The whistleblower shared knowledge about the complex products and transactions involved in the misconduct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The violations would have been difficult to detect without the knowledge of an insider,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.&nbsp;&ldquo;The whistleblower&rsquo;s information played a key role in putting a stop to the misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whistleblower brought to the CFTC&rsquo;s attention failures to comply with certain CFTC rules to protect against fraudulent, deceptive, and manipulative acts or practices, and the whistleblower continued to cooperate with DOE&rsquo;s investigation as it progressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not always easy to come forward, particularly when it involves where you work or people you work with,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young. &ldquo;The CFTC appreciates whistleblowers who make that difficult choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attorney Advisor Rachel Anderson Rynders of the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Office handled this whistleblower award.</p>
<p>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</p>
<p>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to more than $380 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions exceeding $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Anyone with information related to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTC&rsquo;s rules and regulations can submit a tip electronically by filing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip">Form TCR</a>.</p>

<div> fraud, commodities, CEA, restitution, criminal action
<br />
The U.S. District Court found Landgarten defrauded pool participants, commingled funds, and violated CEA regulations. He was also involved in a related criminal action.
<br /><br />Summary: The court found Landgarten guilty of defrauding pool participants and violating CEA regulations, leading to a related criminal action and penalties. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a consent order finding&nbsp;<strong>Harris Bruce Landgarten</strong>, a resident of Old Brookville, New York, defrauded pool participants. He also commingled pool funds with his own funds in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order requires Landgarten to pay $91,000 in restitution to defrauded pool participants and imposes a $91,000 civil monetary penalty along with permanent trading and registration bans as well as a permanent injunction against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Case Background&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The order finds that from July 2014 through March 2017 (relevant period), Landgarten operated the Tradeanedge Members Fund (TMF) commodity pool, consisting of three pool participants who invested $150,000 total. Landgarten incurred purported pool expenses and subsequently withdrew money from the TMF account to reimburse himself for such expenses. Rather than disclose he was incurring purported expenses and using pool participants&rsquo; funds to reimburse himself for these expenses, Landgarten instead misrepresented to the pool participants &ndash; on statements he prepared and provided &ndash; that their investments were worth an amount that included the funds he had already spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order also finds that, on numerous occasions, Landgarten withdrew more money from TMF, in the form of cash withdrawals and electronic transfers to himself, than he had incurred in claimed expenses, and thus commingled pool funds with his own funds. At times during the relevant period, the amount Landgarten withdrew in excess of claimed expenses and commingled with non-pool funds exceeded $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CFTC does not tolerate fraud or any attempts to obstruct our mission to ferret out fraudsters and wrongdoers and hold them accountable,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring payment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Criminal Action&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District filed a related criminal action charging Landgarten with one count of commodities fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of attempt to obstruct an official proceeding [<em>See United States v. Landgarten</em>, No. 18-cr-328 (E.D.N.Y. June 28, 2018).]&nbsp; On February 3, 2023, Landgarten pled guilty to attempting to obstruct an official proceeding and was later sentenced to 10 months imprisonment, along with 100 hours of community service, and a period of supervised release after he is released from prison. Landgarten was also ordered to pay $91,000 in restitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the National Futures Association.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Michael Berlowitz, Trevor Kokal, David Acevedo, Lenel Hickson, Jr., Manal M. Sultan, and former staff member Gabriella Geanuleas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CFTC&rsquo;s Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/learnandprotect/learningresources" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_commoditypool.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_forex.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Forex Trading Fraud Advisory</a>, which help customers identify these scams.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.&nbsp; A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NFA BASIC</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>CFTC Staff Extends Brexit-Related No-Action Positions</title>

<div> Division of Market Oversight, Market Participants Division, no-action positions, United Kingdom, European Union <br />
Summary: The CFTC extends temporary no-action positions for Brexit, adds MTFs in UK, amends existing positions, and works for regulatory certainty. <br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight (DMO) and Market Participants Division (MPD) announced today they are extending temporary no-action positions in connection with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), known as Brexit. [See CFTC Staff Letter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-11/download">24-11</a>]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In addition, DMO is amending its no-action position to include two additional multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) authorized in the UK. The no-action position was also amended to remove an MTF and an organised trading facility because the facilities are no longer authorized in the UK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On February 25, 2019, the CFTC issued a statement in conjunction with the Bank of England, including the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the Financial Conduct Authority to provide regulatory certainty on the continuity of derivatives trading and clearing activities between the UK and the United States. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7876-19">7876-19</a>]&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The letter announced today extends the positions previously announced in CFTC Staff Letter No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/22-16/download">22-16</a>. It seeks to maintain the regulatory certainty established when the CFTC originally acted to issue EU comparability determinations and exemptive orders for certain EU entities. MPD and DMO continue to believe that maintaining these no action positions is proper while the CFTC works with the relevant UK authorities to analyze relevant UK law and, where appropriate, issue UK comparability determinations and exemptive orders for certain UK entities.</span></span></p>

<div> resolution, accountability, transformation, cultural change, independent investigation
Summary:<br />Acting Comptroller Michael J. Hsu supports resolution promoting accountability, cultural transformation, independent investigation, and structural change for a safe, fair, and inclusive FDIC workplace.<br /> <div>
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu today issued the following statement in support of his vote on a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) resolution to support a safe, fair and inclusive workplace for all FDIC employees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Yesterday, I joined the Board in supporting a resolution promoting accountability at the FDIC. This action is part of our broader effort to transform the culture and structure of the agency so that it is a safe, fair, and inclusive workplace for all FDIC employees. The measure promotes accountability by ensuring that independent, third-party investigations of executives and Board members can proceed immediately, pending the full operationalization of the Office of Professional Conduct (OPC) and Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO). The resolution also provides a fair means for Cleary Gottlieb to share information regarding allegations against FDIC executives and Board members with independent investigators, while protecting the confidentiality and anonymity of those who engaged in the Cleary Gottlieb review.</em></p>
<p><em>This is just one of a number of important actions taken by the FDIC to transform the culture and structure of the agency. As co-chair of the Special Review Committee which oversaw the independent review conducted by Cleary Gottlieb, I remain fully committed to implementing all of the recommendations in the Cleary Gottlieb report.</em></p>
<p><em>Real transformation requires continued oversight and monitoring. At my request, the Board also recently received an update on the implementation of the agency&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/action-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Action Plan</a>. The Action Plan synthesizes all of the recommendations from the Cleary Gottlieb review, the Office of Inspector General review, and internal initiatives into a single, coherent set of workstreams and projects with sponsors and deadlines. Actions included in the plan include protecting victims and survivors, making structural changes in how incidents are reported and leaders are held accountable, finalizing new anti-fraternization and anti-retaliation policies, and developing a table of penalties to ensure that disciplinary actions are consistently applied.</em></p>
<p><em>For the Action Plan update, the Board was joined by Carrie Cohen, Esq. whom, along with her law firm Morrison &amp; Forester LLP, was recently selected unanimously to serve as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2024/fdic-board-selects-carrie-h-cohen-independent-monitor-support-cultural" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Independent Transformation Monitor</a>. Ms. Cohen has been charged with monitoring and auditing the FDIC&rsquo;s transformation efforts including implementing recommendations from the Action Plan, the Cleary Gottlieb report, reports from the FDIC Office of the Inspector General, and related work.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, the Board voted unanimously to hire a Third-Party Expert who will advise the Board on the agency&rsquo;s transformation efforts. An announcement is forthcoming.</em></p>
<p><em>Cultural transformation requires strong leaders. The Board will soon select Directors to lead the OPC and the OEEO, which were established on June 20, 2024. These offices report directly to the Board rather than management, thus mitigating the risk of retaliation, which the Cleary Gottlieb report identified as one of the root causes of the agency&rsquo;s issues. Hiring the most qualified and independent Directors to lead these offices with all deliberate speed is a top priority for me, as it represents yet another step towards credible reporting channels that can be trusted by all FDIC employees.</em></p>
<p><em>Sustained cultural transformation requires structural change. Taken together, implementing the Action Plan, hiring the Independent Monitor and Third-Party Expert, and standing up the OPC and OEEO represent significant structural improvements for the FDIC. These changes are necessary to truly transform the culture. They are actions, not just words, and are intended to demonstrate to FDIC employees that this time will be different.</em></p>
<p><em>Throughout this process, I have put the interests of FDIC employees first and repeatedly emphasized the need to focus on substance &ndash; namely, the steps necessary to transform the culture and structure of the agency. The proposal adopted by the Board today provides a clear path for executives and Board members to be held accountable in a timely and fair manner pending the full operationalization of the OPC and OEEO, while also respecting the confidentiality and anonymity of those who engaged in the Cleary Gottlieb review. I was surprised by Director McKernan&rsquo;s objection, as his counterproposal distracts from our substantive goals.</em></p>
<p><em>I remain committed to protecting and serving the employees of the FDIC and continuing to work with all members of the Board to seek consensus to make the agency safe, fair, and inclusive for all.</em></p>

<title>New Research Reveals Why Some Canadians Choose DIY Investing Over Financial Advisors</title>

<div> Convenience, control, lower costs, Canadian investors, DIY investors
Summary:<br /><br />Canadian investors are turning to self-managed investing for autonomy, cost savings, and financial knowledge. Social media is increasingly influential in investment decisions. <div>
<p>Convenience, control and lower costs are among the main reasons why some investors choose to manage their own investment portfolios instead of working with a financial advisor, according to new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/About/Reports-and-Publications/2024-DIY-Investing-Full-Report.pdf" target="_blank">research</a>&nbsp;from the B.C. Securities Commission&nbsp;<span>(BCSC)</span>.</p>
<p>The national survey of Canadian investors, conducted by Innovative Research Group, was commissioned to better understand the attitudes, behaviours and trends of do-it-yourself (DIY) investors, also known as self-directed or self-managed investing.</p>
<p>The study focused on how DIY investors differ from those who work with advisors, how they research investment opportunities, and the influence and role of social media in their decision-making. While DIY investing is growing gradually, the findings show that it&rsquo;s catching on faster with younger and newer investors.</p>
<p>Forty-three per cent of Canadian investors have some DIY investments, while 64 per cent have an advisor. Of those who have an advisor, about a third also self-manage some of their investments.</p>
<p>DIY investors are diverse in their reasons for investing and how engaged they are in managing their own portfolios.</p>
<p>While 77 per cent of all investors say their main investment goals are long-term savings or retirement, DIY investors are more likely to say they also invest for other reasons like generating additional income, the chance of receiving a very large return, or just to have fun.</p>
<p>Thirty-three per cent of DIY investors cited having more control over their investments as the most important reason for managing some or all of their investments themselves. DIY investors tend to have less trust overall in media, government and financial institutions. Those who choose not to work with advisors cite concerns about the value of the advice they provide, costs, and a desire to bear personal responsibility for any losses they may incur. Other key reasons for managing their own investments include convenience and gaining more financial literacy.</p>
<p>Most Canadian investors &ndash; 67 per cent &ndash; still look first to advisors or financial institutions like banks for information on investing, followed by family and friends, online sources and social media. When it comes to social media, YouTube is the most popular source of financial information overall with 10 per cent of Canadians using the platform. TikTok is where 20 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds say they turn to first to help them make decisions about money.</p>
<p>DIY investors are more likely than those using financial advisors to turn to social media for information and are generally more trusting of what they find there. Ten per cent of all Canadians report purchasing an investment they first learned about on social media within the last year, but that number climbs to 25 per cent for young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While many investors still seek traditional advisory services, a notable number of Canadians are drawn to DIY investing for its autonomy, potential cost savings, and the pursuit of financial knowledge,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director, Communications &amp; Education. &ldquo;As we navigate an evolving investment landscape, understanding investors&rsquo; motivations will help us, as regulators, provide the resources and protections they need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/About/Reports-and-Publications/2024-DIY-Investing-Full-Report.pdf" target="_blank">research</a>&nbsp;is available on the BCSC&rsquo;s investor education website.</p>

<div> Opinion, EBA, Dutch Central Bank, risk weight, residential real estate market
Summary:
Opinion published by EBA on Dutch Central Bank's extension of risk weight measure for residential real estate market, addressing systemic risks and inviting close monitoring. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published an Opinion following the notification by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank - DNB) of its intention to extend a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-opinion-measures-address-macroprudential-risk-1" title="EBA issues Opinion on measures to address macroprudential risk following notification by De Nederlandsche Bank"><span>measure originally introduced in 2022</span></a><span>&nbsp;for a further two years until 2026. The measure aims to maintain the resilience of institutions against a potential severe downturn in the residential real estate market. This action comes amidst&nbsp; recent sustained real estate price increases.&nbsp;Based on the information provided by the DNB, the EBA does not object to the extension of the measure.</span></p>
<p>The measure imposes a minimum average risk weight on Dutch housing loan portfolios for credit institutions that have adopted an internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. The minimum average risk weight is based on a risk weight function which relies on the Loan-to-Value (LTV) of each loan. The measure does not apply to exposures which are wholly or partly covered by the Dutch National Mortgage Guarantee scheme (NHG).&nbsp;The period of application of the two-year extension will start from 1 December 2024.</p>
<p>In its Opinion, addressed to the Council, the European Commission, and the DNB, the EBA takes note of the continued elevated level of systemic risk related to the housing market in the Netherlands. The EBA continues to acknowledge&nbsp;the risks from the high household indebtedness in the Netherlands and the large share of banks&rsquo; exposures to the residential real estate mortgage market, including high-LTV loans. The EBA invites the DNB to closely monitor any overlaps of the proposed measure with the output floor and to stand ready to review the calibration of the proposed measure.</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>On 22 July 2024, the European Banking Authority (EBA) received a notification from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) on the intention of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Central Bank of the Netherlands &ndash; DNB), to apply Article 458(9) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms&nbsp;(Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR). In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 458(4) of the CRR, within one month of receiving notification from the designated or competent authority entrusted with the national application of Article 458 of the CRR, the EBA is required to provide its opinion on the points referred to in Article 458(2) of the CRR to the Council, the European Commission and the Member State concerned.</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On NFX Settlement Order</title>

<div> de-registered, exchange, incentive programs, anti-competitive, settlement

Summary:
Commissioner Pham dissents on the CFTC's settlement order regarding NFX, criticizing its anti-competitive nature, unsupported assumptions, and prescriptive approach. <div>
<p><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham today released the following statement on the CFTC&rsquo;s settlement order regarding Nasdaq Futures, Inc. (NFX):</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;Unfortunately, today&rsquo;s action is about beating a dead market that de-registered with the CFTC in 2020. Exchange incentive programs are commonplace in both securities and derivatives markets, although the CFTC has less experience with program features that are widely used to provide liquidity in equities. I am concerned that the CFTC&rsquo;s anti-competitive speaking order will create confusion and discourage exchanges from maintaining liquid, efficient markets to promote accurate pricing and tight spreads by the appropriate use of incentive programs. Today&rsquo;s order also makes assumptions and characterizations that are not supported by the facts. And, this settlement continues the CFTC&rsquo;s campaign against highly respected legal and compliance professionals by slapping on allegations of making false statements even when information was provided honestly to the best of their knowledge in good faith and without intent to defraud. The CFTC&rsquo;s standard is apparently that everyone must know everything everywhere all at once. Finally, this settlement order is a new prescriptive approach to the CFTC&rsquo;s longstanding Core Principles regulatory framework for futures exchanges. You can&rsquo;t play by the rules when the game keeps changing. For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Orders Nasdaq Futures, Inc. To Pay $22 Million For Core Principle Violations, Failing To Fully Disclose Incentives, Providing False And Misleading Information</title>

<div> order, Nasdaq Futures Inc., incentive program, CFTC, violation
Summary: CFTC charges Nasdaq Futures Inc. for failing to disclose incentive program details, making false statements, and not following regulatory recommendations. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Nasdaq Futures, Inc., formerly a designated contract market (DCM). The order finds Nasdaq Futures, Inc. failed to properly establish, monitor, or enforce rules related to an incentive program Nasdaq Futures, Inc. offered to certain traders on its DCM. The order also finds Nasdaq Futures, Inc. did not fully disclose this incentive program&rsquo;s details to the CFTC or the public consistent with the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission Regulations. In addition, the order finds Nasdaq Futures, Inc. made false and misleading statements to the CFTC regarding the incentive program. The order requires Nasdaq Futures, Inc. to pay a $22 million civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="xmsonormal">&ldquo;The CFTC&rsquo;s oversight regime depends upon CFTC-designated exchanges providing the CFTC and market participants accurate information,&rdquo; said&nbsp;CFTC Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Nasdaq Futures, Inc.&rsquo;s conduct here represents significant violations of both its duty to provide such information and several statutory Core Principles applicable to CFTC-designated exchanges.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order finds from July 2015 through July 2018, Nasdaq Futures, Inc. operated as a DCM focused on energy commodity futures contracts. Nasdaq Futures, Inc. offered various incentive programs to certain traders on its contract market, including its &ldquo;Designated Market Maker&rdquo; (DMM) program. The DMM program, as disclosed to the CFTC and the public, paid a fixed monthly stipend to&nbsp;market makers. However, Nasdaq Futures, Inc. also made payments to a select number of DMM program participants that were based on the total volume of contracts those participants traded; this volume-based component was not disclosed to the CFTC, as required by the CEA and associated regulations. In fact, Nasdaq Futures, Inc.&rsquo;s rule submissions to the CFTC regarding its incentive programs omitted or explicitly denied the existence of a volume-based incentive as part of the DMM program. In addition, when interviewed by CFTC staff about whether Nasdaq Futures, Inc. paid DMM program participants for trade volume, its employees repeatedly stated there was no volume-based component to the DMM program. Nasdaq Futures, Inc. reasonably should have known all such denials, statements, and omissions were false and misleading at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, Nasdaq Futures, Inc.&rsquo;s failure to disclose this volume-based component of the DMM program to the CFTC, the public, its own compliance staff, and regulatory service provider led to the violation of several DCM Core Principles mandated in the CEA. Finally, Nasdaq Futures, Inc. did not follow its regulatory service provider&rsquo;s recommendation to contact three DMM program participants about certain trading activity or document why it did not, in violation of a CFTC Regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the National Futures Association.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Brett Shanks, Elsie Robinson, Jeff Le Riche, Brandon Wozniak, Margaret Aisenbrey, Jordon Grimm, Christopher Reed, Charles Marvine, and former staff member Jo Mettenburg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>Saxo Bank Announces H1 2024 Results</title>

<div> clients, assets, profit, restructuring, diversification
<br />
Saxo Bank reported a 35% increase in adjusted net profit, reaching EUR 68 million, and a record 1.2 million clients with EUR 109 billion in assets. The bank achieved a balanced income from various business areas and strengthened its financial position with an S&amp;P rating upgrade. The restructuring in the Asia-Pacific region resulted in EUR 6 million in costs. The bank aims to maintain its adjusted net profit within the range of EUR 114-134 million for the full year.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Saxo Bank's H1 2024 results showed increased net profit, a record number of clients and assets, balanced income from different business areas, and a restructuring initiative in the Asia-Pacific region. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.home.saxo/about-us/media-center" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>The Saxo Bank Group</b></a><b>&nbsp;reported an adjusted net profit of EUR 68 million, compared to EUR 50 million for the same period last year, corresponding to an increase of 35%.</b></p>
<p>During 2024, the Saxo Bank Group rolled out a new competitive pricing structure that lowers costs for clients as well as improvements to the client experience, leading to a record number of clients and client assets, with over 1.2 million end clients and EUR 109 billion in client assets as of 30 June 2024.</p>
<p>Volatility across financial markets has been low in the first half of 2024 resulting in lower trading and investing activity, while the higher interest rates and positive inflow of client funding impacted the financial performance positively.</p>
<p>Despite the short-term negative impact of reduced pricing, total income increased slightly to EUR 311 million in the first half of 2024 and was diversified almost equally between the business areas with trader clients accounting for 34%, investor clients 34%, and institutional 32%.</p>
<p>Moreover, S&amp;P upgraded Saxo Bank&rsquo;s rating to A- from BBB during the first half of the year in a testament to the Saxo Bank Group&rsquo;s strong financial position.</p>
<p>To increase focus, strengthen compliance, reduce risk, and enhance operational efficiency, the Saxo Bank Group initiated a restructuring of its distribution model in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the strategic opportunities for its offices in Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia, while the office in Shanghai is in the process of being closed. This has led to recognition of restructuring costs of EUR 6 million in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>The Saxo Bank Group expects the full year&rsquo;s adjusted net profit to be maintained in line with the previously guided range of EUR 114 - 134 million.</p>
<p><b>H1 2024 key financial figures (H1 2023)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Total income: EUR 311 million (EUR 300 million)</li>
<li>Net profit (adjusted): EUR 68 million (EUR 50 million)</li>
<li>Net profit: EUR 62 million (EUR 38 million)</li>
<li>Total client assets: EUR 109 billion (EUR 97 billion)</li>
<li>Total capital ratio: 28% (31.9%)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commenting on the results,&nbsp;<b>Kim Fournais</b>, CEO and Founder of Saxo Bank, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The positive momentum we&rsquo;ve experienced in the first half of the year is a strong indicator that our strategy is resonating with our clients. More than 1.2 million clients now trust Saxo with more than EUR 109.38 billion in assets. This is a result of our relentless focus on enhancing our investment platforms, products, and services, and offering very competitive pricing that empowers our growing client base to make more of their money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also encouraging to see our clients increasingly recognising the value of diversifying their portfolios across different markets and asset classes. In these uncertain times, we remain fully focused on facilitating diversification across asset classes, making it easier and more attractive for investors to build healthy and profitable portfolios and manage their risks. Diversification is truly the "only free lunch" in investing - and we are here to provide the tools, product range, and insights to help our clients navigate their portfolios with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Please note: the Saxo Bank Group&rsquo;s annual report is presented in DKK (Danish Kroner). All figures in this press release have been converted to EUR using an exchange rate of 7.46, as of August 27, 2024.</i></p>

<title>Financial Education Among Young Austrians Still In Need Of Improvement: Vienna Stock Exchange Strengthens Cooperation With University Colleges Of Teacher Education</title>

<div> Education, Austria, Financial literacy, Vienna Stock Exchange, PISA assessment
<br />
Summary:<br />
Financial literacy in Austrian students is above average, but lacking in capital market and pension topics. Vienna Stock Exchange promotes financial education. <div>
<p>Next Monday, the school bells will ring again in the eastern part of Austria. A familiar sound for the students, in contrast to that of the stock exchange bell. When it comes to financial education, there is still room for improvement in Austria. The results of the 2022 PISA assessment on financial literacy, in which 20 OECD countries took partand which was published this summer confirm that Austrian students have above-average financial knowledge by comparison. However, financial literacy generally lags behind when it comes to capital market and pension topics in particular. The Vienna Stock Exchange is counteracting the lack of financial knowledge with its educational programme and is also intensifying its cooperation with University Colleges of Teacher Education.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/young-austrians-financial-knowledge-2024.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Financial education among young Austrians still in need of improvement" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/e/7/csm_young-austrians-financial-knowledge-2024_1757625922.jpg" title="Financial education among young Austrians still in need of improvement" width="514" /></a></p>
<p>"The ranking in the PISA test may sound pleasing at first glance, but in fact we are only in 6th place in the regional league in an international comparison. In detail, the results show that there is still a lot to be done, especially in the areas of investment and the capital market. Many students are very uncertain about investment products such as stocks, which are essential for building wealth. Important basic knowledge, such as diversification and/or compound interest, is often lacking," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange, categorising the study results.</p>
<p>This is because the level of competence is generally moderate when compared on a global level. On average, no participating country achieves the second-highest of five competence levels. Students at this competence level can understand and explain more complex financial products, make long-term financial decisions also taking into account total costs and interpret detailed financial documents. Austria is in the third competence level.</p>
<h2>"Aktienbarometer": Lack of knowledge hampers young people's pension provision</h2>
<p>However, there is certainly a wish among young people to deepen their knowledge in this area, as the Austrian &ldquo;Aktienbarometer&rdquo; &ndash; a survey on securities ownership by Aktienforum, the Federation of Austrian Industries and the Vienna Stock Exchange &ndash; clearly shows. According to the study, one in five teenagers and young adults aged 16 to 19 already invests money in the capital market, while around two thirds of this age group who do not own securities are interested in investing. However, three quarters of them feel that their financial knowledge of the securities market is insufficient &ndash; and therefore refrain from investing. According to PISA, there is also a large socio-economic gap, with students from better-off families tending to have more financial knowledge.</p>
<p>"Our demand is therefore very clear: financial education must be included in the school curriculum across the board and accessible to everyone," says Boschan, "after the curriculum reform with more economic and financial education in the 5th to 8th grade, more financial knowledge must also be taught at upper secondary level. After all, a lack of knowledge today will cost many young people prosperity and financial security tomorrow."</p>
<h2>Vienna Stock Exchange promotes financial education with its own academy, lectures and materials</h2>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange has been helping to raise the level of financial education in Austria for many years with free school presentations and teaching materials for lower and upper secondary schools. The exchange also co-operates with University Colleges of Teacher Education, where teachers are supported in teaching financial knowledge in joint workshops and seminars. This cooperation will be further expanded in the future and soon be extended from two to eight University Colleges of Teacher Education.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Wiener B&ouml;rse Akademie&rdquo; also offers a wide range of training and further education programmes. Both newcomers to the stock market and experienced investment professionals have the opportunity to improve their education about the capital market and benefit from practical courses and the many years of experience of a team of experts. The Vienna Stock Exchange Academy has been a co-operation between the WIFI Management Forum and Wiener B&ouml;rse AG since 2005.</p>
<p>As part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmf.gv.at/en/the-ministry/National-Financial-Literacy-Strategy.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">National Financial Literacy Strategy</a>, the Vienna Stock Exchange is committed to increasing financial knowledge in Austria and actively supports the initiative with five educational measures that fulfil the strategy's strict quality standards.</p>

<div> ESMA, financial markets, risks, EU, liquidity
Summary:
ESMA reports high risks in EU financial markets, including market volatility, deteriorating credit risk, and liquidity issues. Structural developments and market monitoring are also highlighted. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, today publishes its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-08/ESMA50-524821-3444_TRV_2_2024.pdf">second risk monitoring report of 2024</a>, setting out the key risk drivers currently facing EU financial markets. External events continue to have a strong impact on the evolution of financial markets, and ESMA also sees high or very high overall risks in the markets within its remit.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Less volatile markets earlier in 2024 and a return of search-for-yield behaviour in riskier market segments suggested a general market anticipation of a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo;. However, more recent events show how markets remain very sensitive, especially to interest rate developments, deteriorating credit risk and to political and electoral news. There remains a high risk of corrections in a context of fragile market liquidity, in equity and in other markets.</p>
<p>Verena Ross, ESMA&rsquo;s Chair, said:</p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;Markets are getting more nervous about the economic outlook and political events, as the dip in equity valuations in early August and&nbsp;market volatility around recent European and French&nbsp;elections shows.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>Close monitoring of the financial markets in our remit and strong coordination of supervisory efforts with national authorities remains our priority.</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>We continue to see risks in the fund area linked to liquidity mis-matches, particularly in the real estate sector, and deteriorating quality of assets linked&nbsp;to interest rate, credit risk and valuation issues.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>Beyond the risk drivers, ESMA&rsquo;s report provides an update on structural developments and the status of key sectors of financial markets, during the first half of 2024.</p>
<h4><span>Structural developments</span></h4>
<p><a><span>Market-based finance:</span>&nbsp;</a>Capital availability for European corporates through capital markets has been broadly stable in 2024 so far. Although the market environment remains very challenging for equity issuance, there were signs of improvement in IPO activity. Corporate bond issuance was high in 1Q24 but fell in the second quarter of the year. The corporate bond outlook continues to show a significant upcoming maturity wall from 2024 until 2028. In this context, corporate debt sustainability remains a considerable risk, especially in lower quality segments.</p>
<p><a><span>Sustainable finance:</span>&nbsp;</a>In the last few years, a strong interest in and uptake of sustainable investments has been sending positive signals about investors&rsquo; willingness to finance the green transition. However, recent ESG-related market developments have sparked concerns on the ability to mobilise private capital, with green bond issuance slowing and sustainable funds facing outflows for the first time in 2H23. Looking ahead, firms&rsquo; ability to announce credible transition plans could steer broader willingness to invest in transitioning firms, supported by transition finance instruments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a><span>Financial innovation:</span>&nbsp;</a>Crypto-assets markets continued to surge in the first half of 2024, fuelled by the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs&nbsp;in the US, to reach a total global market valuation of EUR 2.2tn by end-June (+40% since end-2023). Liquidity also recovered to pre-FTX levels. However, the market developments in early August led to volatility and some substantial falls in crypto-asset valuations. High concentration also continues both for crypto-assets and crypto exchanges.</p>
<h4><span>Market monitoring</span></h4>
<p><span>Securities markets:&nbsp;</span>Asset prices in early 2024 trended upwards with little volatility suggesting future rate cuts were being anticipated. Episodes of market volatility took place linked to elections in the EU in June and July, and a short-lived dip in global equity valuations in early August was&nbsp;associated with weaker-than-expected US macroeconomic indicators. In fixed income markets, corporate bond spreads have continued to fall, especially for high-yield corporates while the credit quality of high-yield non-financials has continued to decline, particularly real estate. This may indicate search-for-yield behaviour with a possible underestimation of risks.</p>
<p><span>Asset management:</span>&nbsp;EU fund performance was positive across categories and funds exposed to fixed income instruments (bond funds and MMFs) recorded inflows. The increase in interest rates has been offset by a broad-based market perception of declining credit risk, reflected in low credit spreads. However, bond fund portfolio credit quality, as measured by credit rating, has continued to deteriorate, raising the risk of a disorderly repricing of risky assets. Risks continue around liquidity risks and potential losses related to interest rate, credit risk and valuation issues. Open-ended real estate funds remain particularly vulnerable given their structural liquidity mismatch and downward pressure on valuations in housing markets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The increase in the number of online accounts to 1.679 million, accounting for 95% of all investment accounts, reflects the dynamic development of digitalisation in the Polish capital market.

<p>In 2021, GPW modified its methodology of sourcing data necessary to calculate the share of different groups of investors in turnover on the exchange. Such data are now sourced from broker&rsquo;s orders placed in the Exchange&rsquo;s trading system. As a result, the aggregation and presentation of data on the percentage share of domestic individual investors was modified. The number of online accounts is determined in a GPW survey covering domestic brokers. The number of active investment accounts is sourced from the Exchange&rsquo;s trading system and represents the number of accounts for which at least one order was placed on GPW in the period under review.</p>
<p>The detailed results of the survey concerning the share of investors in financial instruments turnover are published on the GPW website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gpw.pl/analysis-investor-share-in-trading">https://www.gpw.pl/analysis-investor-share-in-trading</a>.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify">Main recommendations for the European Commission&rsquo;s consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EU Taxonomy</span>&nbsp;should become the sole, common reference point for the assessment of sustainability and should be embedded in all Sustainable Finance legislation;</li>
<li>The EU Taxonomy should be completed for all activities that can substantially contribute to environmental sustainability and a social taxonomy developed;</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">definition of transition investments</span>&nbsp;should be incorporated into the Framework to provide legal clarity and support the creation of transition-related products;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All financial products should disclose some minimum basic sustainability information</span>, covering environmental and social characteristics;</li>
<li>A&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">product categorisation system</span>&nbsp;should be introduced catering to sustainability and transition, based on a set of clear eligibility criteria and binding transparency obligations;&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ESG data products</span>&nbsp;should be brought into the regulatory perimeter, the consistency of ESG metrics continue to be improved, reliability of estimates ensured; and</li>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges Sets Out Good Practice For Crypto-Asset Custody Providers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> WFE, crypto-asset custody, regulations, investor protection, financial markets<br />
Summary:<br />
WFE recommends best practices for crypto custody providers, including client asset segregation, cyber risk management, and conflict of interest resolution. <br />The industry should follow the recommendations for stronger investor protection and market integrity. <br />Training Webinar for members on crypto custody best practice is available. <div>
<p>Today the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and central clearing counterparties, has published recommendations that establish good practice for crypto-asset custody providers, drawing lessons from traditional financial markets to guide the emerging digital asset space.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ruling against FTX and Alameda in the US earlier this month exemplifies the broader shift in expectations for the crypto industry to be held to higher standards closer to that of well-functioning finance, ensuring stronger protections for investors.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next area that needs addressing is the inadequate custody control amongst crypto platforms, which underscores the risk to both market integrity and investor protection. Without proper custody controls there is a heightened risk of financial loss, fraud and mismanagement. This undermines investor confidence and the overall integrity of markets.<br /><br />The report addresses the urgent need for regulation and best practices in the wake of high-profile failures within the crypto industry and this can make the difference in attracting investment from institutions yet to allocate to crypto.<br /><br />The WFE recommends that crypto custody providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider segregating client assets to ensure they are protected in the event of a company&rsquo;s bankruptcy.</li>
<li>Ensure client assets remain bankruptcy-remote, ie, separate from those of other persons, whether legal or natural.</li>
<li>Address cyber risks through thoughtful technology architecture decisions and the operation of mature cyber security programmes.</li>
<li>Provide more than a place to hold or administer assets.</li>
<li>Ensure that conflicts of interest are adequately managed and addressed.</li>
<li>Manage all aspects of operational resilience across their support model.</li>
<li>Disclose risks in a way that is clear and understandable, particularly for retail customers.</li>
<li>Have adequate insurance and/or surety bonds and disclose these policies in clear understandable terms.</li>
<li>Seek independent audits from reputable and credible auditors to provide an assessment of financial statements, process and controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nandini Sukumar, Chief Executive Officer, at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The FTX collapse and longstanding worries about insufficient custody controls in the crypto industry highlight risks to both market integrity and investor protection. Crypto custody providers should learn from more traditional markets that have a track record of functioning well and can start by following the recommendations we have set out today.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;While these technological innovations and the associated concerns about managing generative AI are significant, it is important to remember that, as trusted third parties providing secure and regulated platforms for trading securities, our members are already carefully scrutinising tools and establishing controls to govern AI use. The US Treasury should therefore take care to design an AI regulatory framework which is principles based, to maintain flexibility and encourage innovation. We also need to have an incremental approach to AI regulation, allowing for gradual adjustments and learning, ensuring that regulations do not hinder technological progress.&rdquo;<br /><br />Read the full paper&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=faf3e01aa3&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />The WFE will be holding a Training Webinar for members on crypto custody best practice.

<div> ETFs, Fixed Maturity, Bonds, ESG, Active Management
<br />
BNP Paribas Asset Management listed 3 fixed maturity ETFs and launched 2 fixed maturity active funds. The funds offer diversified, sustainable, and liquid investment solutions.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The article discusses the characteristics of BNPP AM's new fixed maturity ETFs and active funds, focusing on diversification, sustainability, and active management. <div>
<p>BNP Paribas Asset Management (&lsquo;BNPP AM&rsquo;) announced this week the listing of 3 fixed maturity ETFs on Euronext Paris and Xetra (with Borsa Italiana next week) as well as the launch of 2 fixed maturity active funds in May this year.</p>
<p>Fixed Maturity Plans (&lsquo;FMPs&rsquo;) are diversified portfolios composed of bonds with similar maturity dates and possibly other debt securities. They are designed to provide investors visibility on the estimated yield to maturity. The portfolio typically has a short to medium-term maturity such as three or five years, depending on the investment horizon.</p>
<p><strong><span>Common features across BNPP AM&rsquo;s active and passive fixed maturity funds&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>are</span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Expose an actively or passively managed portfolio to numerous bonds with similar maturity dates ensuring diversification across issuers, sectors, ratings, and yield to maturity</span></li>
<li><span>Follow the life cycle of a single bond, provide regular interest payment and distribute the final payout at maturity</span></li>
<li><span>Daily liquidity</span></li>
<li><span>Integration of BNPP AM&rsquo;s ESG&nbsp;</span><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=NNTC65D7PVM4N&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-1" id="footnote-marker-light-1-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;<span>methodology with an SI</span><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=NNTC65D7PVM4N&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-2" id="footnote-marker-light-2-1">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;commitment &ge; 30%</span></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pieter Oyens, Global Head of Marketing at BNP Paribas Asset Management:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>With interest rates at their current levels, investors are looking for ways to lock in those rates</em>.<em>&nbsp;Fixed Maturity Products (&ldquo;FMP&rdquo;) can be an excellent way to do this as they give access to a diversified portfolio of bonds which are maturing at a similar point in time and before the product's maturity date. Through FMPs they also enjoy regular income and a predictable total return, assuming they stay until maturity and subject to any credit events.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><span>Characteristics of BNPP AM&rsquo;s 3 fixed maturity ETFs</span></strong><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=NNTC65D7PVM4N&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-4" id="footnote-marker-light-4-1">[4]</a></sup><strong><span>&nbsp;in the Active Beta fixed income range:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three maturity dates</strong>&nbsp;available: December 2027, December 2029 and December 2032</li>
<li><strong>Euro-denominated investment-grade (IG) bonds</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tradeable throughout the day just like any ETF</strong>&nbsp;until maturity</li>
<li>Positions in individual issuers capped at 3% each; final year using uncapped government bond exposure for cash management</li>
<li><strong>Benchmarks</strong>: Bloomberg Euro Corporate indices with December 2027/2029/2032 maturity dates</li>
<li>Replication method:&nbsp;<strong>physical</strong>, with no securities lending.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lorraine Sereyjol-Garros, Global Head of ETF and Index Solutions Business Development:</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This new generation of fixed maturity ETFs should meet specific market demands for sustainable, diversified, liquid and transparent investment solutions with predictable outcomes. Fixed Maturity ETFs can help mitigate reinvestment risk since investors know the duration of their investment and can plan accordingly. Offering a new investment solution that combines fixed maturity with sustainability and low Tracking Error can differentiate this new range of ETFs from traditional options, potentially attracting both retail and institutional clients. It is the perfect complement to the existing range that answers our clients&rsquo; needs on sustainable investments, including on Fixed Income&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><span>Characteristics of BNPP AM&rsquo;s fixed maturity active funds:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The first two funds of BNPP AM active FMPs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two maturity dates</strong>&nbsp;available: June 2027, June 2029</li>
<li><strong>Euro aggregate bond universe&nbsp;</strong>(during investment period)<strong>:</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Active management&nbsp;</strong>to seize opportunities for additional spread and manage downside risks using fixed and floating rate bonds and active allocations in different sectors, geography, issuers, etc.</li>
<li>Diversification within a single portfolio (around 100 securities each)</li>
<li><strong>Minimum 75% IG / maximum 25% in high-yield (HY)</strong><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=NNTC65D7PVM4N&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-5" id="footnote-marker-light-5-1">[5]</a></sup></li>
<li>Developed markets &ndash; only OECD countries (no emerging markets)</li>
<li>Only euro-denominated instruments</li>
<li>No securities with maturities longer than the fund&rsquo;s maturity date + 6 months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Daily NAV (net asset value) to buy or sell</strong>: a distinctive feature of this generation of active FMPs: investors can buy (and sell) any day, up to six months before maturity. The fund applies swing pricing. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Portfolio to&nbsp;<strong>be monitored against the closest OAT</strong><sup><a href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com/WorldClient.dll?Session=NNTC65D7PVM4N&amp;View=BlankMessageBody#footnote-light-6" id="footnote-marker-light-6-1">[6]</a></sup>,&nbsp;hence offering yield visibility at anytime.</li>
<li><strong>A minimum 10% will be invested in green, social and sustainable bonds</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Peter Benschop, Euro Bond Fund Manager: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our new generation Fixed Maturity Plans aim to capture yield, to protect the investor from downside risks, and to generate incremental returns by actively managing the funds. The current rate environment is very favourable for investors seeking to lock in attractive yields for the next few years. With these new products, we offer a solution to achieve this in a risk-controlled manner. Credit selection and monitoring is key to avoid exposure to potential negative credit events. That is why fundamental credit research forms the basis of our rigorous investment process. Another plus of the new generation FMPs is the added flexibility of active management. It enables us to seize opportunities for additional return and to adjust the overall risk level of the funds in changing market conditions.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Appital Expands Offering To Include Pre-Trade Price Discovery Functionality</title>

<div> Price Discovery, Appital Insights, buyside traders, liquidity, bookbuild
Summary:<br />Appital introduces Price Discovery in Appital Insights™, enabling buyside traders to stimulate liquidity and discover pricing dynamics, reducing bookbuild duration and increasing liquidity. <div>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong><span>An industry-first, Price Discovery in Appital Insights&trade; enables buyside traders to stimulate liquidity at market levels, or outside of the spread, before committing to a bookbuild</span></strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong><span>New functionality allows trading desks and investment teams to interact with each other in outsized liquidity price formation, and opportunistic alpha generation, optimising deals before they launch on the platform</span></strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong><span>Driven by client demand, Price Discovery in Appital Insights&trade;, significantly shortens the period of time where shares are locked in to Appital whilst also providing more time for investment teams to react to situations</span></strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong><span>Buyside traders retain full control over how and when they interact with their counterparts and platform liquidity</span></strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Appital, the peer-to-peer price discovery and liquidity sourcing technology for asset managers, today announced the launch of a new functionality designed to stimulate natural liquidity among Appital&rsquo;s buyside clients and discover pricing dynamics on larger ADV orders on their pad.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Price Discovery in Appital Insights&trade;</span><span>&nbsp;is an industry-first functionality that enables buyside traders to invite select feedback on live orders and gain insights on potential pricing and volume before committing an order to a bookbuild or before launching a bookbuild themselves.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Buyside traders retain full control over how and when they interact with their counterparts and platform liquidity. PMs can respond to price discovery processes without generating an order in their EMS, allowing for opportunistic liquidity discovery and alpha generation. The Appital workflow now enables new, uncommitted order types during price discovery, which can transition to committed order types once traders decide to launch a bookbuild. This significantly reduces bookbuild duration while increasing the likelihood of its success. At the same time, buyside firms retain anonymity and minimise the risk of leakage or price erosion.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Price Discovery in Appital Insights&trade;</span><span>&nbsp;evolves the existing workflow and goes one step further:</span><span>&nbsp;Appital clients can unlock latent liquidity by inviting specific firms to provide feedback on potential orders and - if sufficient demand is captured in price discovery - the information flows anonymously back to the originator to launch a bookbuild, and the liquidity is realised.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Brian Guckian, Chief Business Development Officer at Appital, said</span><span>: &ldquo;Our clients are very excited about this new price discovery functionality. They can pick their counterparts, expose a potential deal to them, and get feedback on volume and pricing, before deciding to go ahead with a bookbuild.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is a new and unique workflow that gives clients full control over the bookbuilding process and the ability to proactively stimulate market liquidity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Mark Badyra, CEO of Appital, said</span><span>: &ldquo;With&nbsp;</span><span>Price Discovery in Appital Insights&trade;</span><span>&nbsp;we are digitising yet another step in the high-touch trading mechanism while also minimising risk of information leakage and price erosion. This aligns with our strategy to deliver unique workflows to trading and investment teams. I believe that illiquidity issues can be solved globally by bringing technological innovation into the equity market and providing distinctive functionality to the buyside. With&nbsp;</span><span>Price Discovery in Appital Insights&trade;</span><span>, firms are able to generate orders that would otherwise not exist, resulting in increased deal flows and liquidity events.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The first half of 2024 has been a period of remarkable growth for Appital, with consistent, month-on-month increases. As well as this, our liquidity profile has diversified from a client perspective, with more and more firms joining and using our technology every day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Appital has reached $12bn of buyside liquidity on its platform, with average orders of 2.7 days ADV and opportunities between $1 million and $260 million. 43 asset managers with &gt;$20trn AUM are now signed up, with 60+ more in the onboarding stage, managing an additional $30trn AUM.</span></p>

<title>ASIC: CLSA Pays Penalty For Providing Incorrect Regulatory Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> penalty, regulatory data, market misconduct, technology systems, market participant <br />
Summary:<br />CLSA Australia Pty Limited paid a penalty for failing to provide accurate regulatory data, post trade confirmations, and immediate off-market transaction reports. Inaccuracies arose from a system change oversight. <div>
<p>CLSA Australia Pty Limited has paid a penalty of $144,300 to comply with an infringement notice given by the Markets Disciplinary Panel (MDP) for failing to provide correct regulatory data to the relevant Market Operator.</p>
<p>The MDP also had reasonable grounds to believe that CLSA failed to give post trade confirmations to its clients and immediately report off-market transactions.</p>
<p>Providing accurate regulatory data is a core obligation of market participants as that data is used by ASIC to carry out its mandated function of supervising and ensuring the integrity of the market. It enables ASIC to detect market misconduct and analyse market structure and trends. CLSA inadvertently distorted the data provided to the market operator, potentially hindering ASIC&rsquo;s market surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>The MDP considered that from 23 September 2022 to 3 February 2023, CLSA contravened Rule 7.4.2(1) and Rule 7.4.2(2) by incorrectly tagging Orders as agency instead of principal on 9,243 occasions and Trade Reports on 27 occasions.&nbsp;<span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak">By tagging Orders and Trade Reports as agency instead of principal, CLSA represented that they were conducted on behalf of its clients when in fact they were conducted on CLSA's own behalf, thus giving incorrect information about the origin of those Orders and Trades.</span></p>
<p>The regulatory data failures arose from a planned system change to CLSA&rsquo;s global order management system. The MDP were concerned this system change was not adequately scoped and tested before implementation to capture potential unintended impacts in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The establishment and maintenance of technology systems is a fundamental responsibility of a market participant and although the inaccurate reporting resulted from an inadvertent error, the MDP considered changes made to CLSA systems without appreciation of the global impact was a &lsquo;serious oversight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The MDP considered that global participants need to be mindful that changes in one market may have implications for other markets where they operate. They need to identify these implications and engage with local market participants, such as Australian market participants, to ensure any changes they make do not have adverse flow on effects that may cause the local participants to breach their obligations.</p>
<p>The MDP further considered that CLSA contravened Rule 3.4.1 on 27 occasions by failing to give post trade notifications to its clients and that CLSA contravened Rule 6.3.1(2)(1)(a) by failing to immediately report a pair of Block Trades after their execution, taking 25 minutes to report them.</p>
<p>Compliance with the infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability, and by doing so CLSA is not taken to have contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>View the infringement notice on the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/markets-disciplinary-panel/mdp-outcomes-register/" title="MDP Outcomes Register">Markets Disciplinary Panel Outcomes Register</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CLSA is a market participant of markets operated by ASX Limited and Cboe Australia Limited.<br />On 16 January 2023, CLSA reported two Block Trades, also known as Special Crossings, that generated volume alerts on ASIC&rsquo;s surveillance systems. As a result of ASIC enquiries, it became apparent that a technology change to CLSA&rsquo;s global order management systems (Cobra) was causing the default tagging of facilitation orders to change from &ldquo;Principal&rdquo; to &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; (Cobra Tagging Issue). The Cobra Tagging Issue also resulted in CLSA not providing post trade confirmations to clients in some circumstances.</p>
<p>Unrelated to the Cobra Tagging Issue, the Special Crossings, the subject of the initial enquiries, were executed at around 11.57 am but not reported to the market until approximately 12.24 pm.</p>

<div> Capital requirements, stress test, Federal Reserve, large banks, common equity tier 1 requirement
<br />
Summary:<br /> 
Federal Reserve announced final capital requirements for large banks based on stress test results. Goldman Sachs had its stress capital buffer requirement adjusted. Continuous improvement in stress testing framework is being pursued. <div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Following its stress test earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced final individual capital requirements for all large banks, effective on October 1.</p>
<p>Large bank capital requirements are informed by the Board's stress test results, which provide a risk-sensitive and forward-looking assessment of capital needs. The table shows each bank's common equity tier 1 capital requirement, which is made up of several components, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum capital requirement, which is the same for each bank and is 4.5 percent;</li>
<li>The stress capital buffer requirement, which is based in part on the stress test results and is at least 2.5 percent; and</li>
<li>If applicable, a capital surcharge for the largest and most complex banks, which is updated in the first quarter of each year to account for the overall systemic risk of each of these banks.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>If a bank's capital dips below its total requirement announced today, the bank is subject to automatic restrictions on both capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.</p>
<p>Also today, the Board announced that it had modified the stress capital buffer requirement for Goldman Sachs, after the firm's request for reconsideration. Based on an analysis of additional information presented by the firm in its request, the Board determined it would be appropriate to adjust the treatment of particular historical expenses incurred by the bank in the stress testing models' input data, due to the non-recurring nature of those expenses. As a result, the bank's stress capital buffer requirement has been adjusted to 6.2 percent from a preliminary 6.4 percent.</p>
<p>The Board is focused on continuously improving the stress testing framework. To that end, the Board will analyze whether to revise regulatory reporting forms to better capture these types of data and to explore possible refinements to certain model component</p>

<title>Too Short To Report: Statement On Adoption Of Form N-PORT And Form N-CEN Reporting - Guidance On Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Aug. 28, 2024</title>

<div> SEC, Form N-PORT, amendments, market stress, public disclosure
Summary:<br />Chair Gensler opposes SEC rulemaking on Form N-PORT, citing limited benefits, increased costs, and potential risks to regulated entities. <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler, and good morning. When the market&rsquo;s green arrows flip upside down and turn an alarming red, the demand for explanations and information is immediate. Common questions for the SEC are which funds will be affected and how significantly? We saw such calls for data and real-time analysis at the onset of the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and government response, and Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. As one who seeks answers in times of market stress, I am sympathetic to one of the stated goals of today&rsquo;s rulemaking: ensuring the Commission can conduct informed analysis on funds&rsquo; portfolios as contemporaneous to the events as possible. But the Commission oversells the benefits of today&rsquo;s amendments and gives too little attention to the costs, perhaps because the Commission failed genuinely to seek needed public input on these changes. Accordingly, I cannot support this rulemaking.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2022, the Commission proposed amendments to the open-end fund liquidity risk management regime.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Largely lost amidst the vigorous debate about swing pricing and hard close requirements were the proposed changes to Form N-PORT. Rather than re-propose to give commenters the opportunity to focus exclusively on the N-PORT amendments, the Commission is finalizing modified Form N-PORT changes without much commentary to help us weigh the costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Had we heard more from commenters, we might have concluded that the costs of these changes outweigh the benefits. The amendments will yield benefits, but they are limited. We already collect a tremendous amount of information from registered entities, and it is incumbent upon us to make full use of it before we demand more.</p>
<p>Funds now file Form N-PORT quarterly with up to a 60-day delay. Under the new requirements, filings will be due monthly within thirty days after the end of the month to which they relate. The benefits of the change are that the Commission&rsquo;s information about fund portfolio holdings will be less stale than it would be under the current rule. But the information still will be stale. The Commission will receive information about what funds are holding at the time of a market event sooner than it would under current rules, but the Commission still will have to wait for at least a month for that information. In other words, the Commission, even under the accelerated filing timelines, will have to do legwork at the time of a market event to determine which funds hold what.</p>
<p>The accelerated filing schedule will not do much to &ldquo;enable [the Commission] to further our mission to protect investors by assisting the Commission and its staff in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities related to the asset management industry.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In the case of a discrete event like the Russian invasion, any market-wide shock would be immediate, and information still would be coming in no earlier than thirty days after the shock. Although shorter than the four months it would take under the current rule, the difference would be inconsequential with respect to the Commission&rsquo;s ability to do its immediate analytical job at the time of the market shock.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s other functions&mdash;exams, policy formulation, and enforcement actions&mdash;all operate at a speed that does not demand immediate information. The acknowledged possible increase in data errors that the shortened filing schedule will produce<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;degrades the reliability of the information for all the Commission&rsquo;s functions.</p>
<p>The Commission already can get the information it needs in times of market stress. Under current recordkeeping rules, funds maintain monthly holding information and make it available upon Commission staff request. With access to existing Form N-PORT data, along with discrete pieces of instructive information&mdash;<i>e.g</i>., fund names&mdash;Commission staff can issue tailored enquiries concerning the make-up of relevant fund portfolios.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;This option, the release protests, is &ldquo;challenging for Commission staff,&rdquo; which &ldquo;encountered limits on its ability to identify the funds most directly affected&rdquo; by market stress events.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The challenges to exploiting existing data may be real, but they are not beyond the talented staff&rsquo;s ability to overcome. In any event, those challenges will persist under the new rule, which does not provide real-time information either (nor would it be the right thing to do for many reasons).</p>
<p>While the benefits of an amped-up filing schedule may be debatable, the costs of these amendments are not, especially for smaller fund complexes. Industry commenters of all sizes expressed concerns about the costs of these amendments While the Commission suggests that the costs associated with the new filing deadline are not so bad in light of existing recordkeeping obligations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;commenters provided detailed rebuttals emphasizing that &ldquo;aggregat[ing] the information within 30 days for internal collection purposes&rdquo; &mdash;which they must do under current rules&mdash; is a very different exercise than preparing that information for filing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;As one commenter pointed out, &ldquo;Form N-PORT is an extraordinarily detailed report, requiring funds to provide a variety of information regarding assets and liabilities, performance and flows, portfolio holdings, portfolio risk metrics, liquidity and liquidity risk management, derivatives and derivatives risk management and securities lending.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Ensuring that this complicated form has been completed correctly involves the focused involvement of multiple employees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Many of the employees charged with Form N-PORT filing duties &ldquo;are also responsible for preparing (or contribute information to) funds&rsquo; annual and semi-annual reports, including the associated Schedules of Investments.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;In hopes of mitigating these calls on strained resources, some commenters requested an expansion of the new 30-day filing requirement to 45-days<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;or more for small entities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;We ignored those calls.</p>
<p>Other commenters pointed to the less quantifiable, but more fundamentally damaging, costs arising from the new public disclosure rules. The amendments will make funds&rsquo; monthly reports on Form N-PORT public 60 days after the end of each month. Currently, only information for the third month of a quarter is publicly available. Commenters are concerned &ldquo;that monthly disclosure of portfolio holdings could result in information leakage that is harmful to funds and their shareholders.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The risk is particularly great for certain types of funds, which is reflected in the different approaches to voluntary portfolio disclosure that funds take currently. Contrary to the comfort the Commission draws from the existing voluntary disclosure practices,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;the variation in practice suggests that the costs of monthly public disclosure outweigh the benefits for some funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The public disclosure may prompt frontrunning and other predatory trading practices. The Commission &ldquo;recognizes an increase in risk for a small universe of funds,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;but assures us that predatory trading is not all bad.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;In so doing, the Commission continues to undervalue the work that goes into deciding which securities to buy and sell.</p>
<p>Capital markets participants should be rewarded for good investment decisions and punished for bad ones. The release threatens this broader principle of market discipline. One of the justifications for the change is that we need information during times of market stress so that we or our financial regulatory colleagues can do&nbsp;<i>something</i>. If history is any guide, that&nbsp;<i>something</i>&nbsp;is likely to be a bailout of some sort. And then our friends on the Financial Stability Oversight Council will use that rescue to argue for more control over open-end funds. Changes like the ones we are making today set the groundwork for replacing market discipline with regulatory micromanagement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>In addition to the rule changes, the adopting release includes new guidance to clarify a number of issues related to the liquidity rule. I hope that this guidance is helpful and that we remain attentive to industry calls for clarity following the issuance of these amendments and guidance.</p>
<p>Despite my inability to support this rulemaking, I could not be more grateful to the Commission staff for their demonstrated care and professionalism. The women and men of the Divisions of Investment Management, and Economic and Risk Analysis, in particular, have done their best to address commenters in their formulation of these final amendments. I am particularly grateful for their patience. Despite their often-punishing drafting schedules they never failed to respond to my many questions promptly and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>I have several questions:</p>
<ol>
<li class="pf0">As we collect more and more information from registered entities on more compressed timetables, I increasingly worry about our ability to protect that information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;What assurance can we provide to regulated entities that we are taking every effort to protect their confidential information?</li>
<li class="pf0">A 45-day lag between the end of the month and the Form N-PORT due date (as compared to the 30-day lag that we are adopting) would help to mitigate any damage should any information be misappropriated from Form N-PORT. Why are we not adopting a 45-day lag?</li>
<li class="pf0">Commenters raised concerns about the increased threat of predatory trading that the enhanced public reporting creates. In the release we say that we &ldquo;minimiz[e] the risks of exposing funds to predatory trading by delaying public reporting by 60 days.&rdquo; What do you say to those funds who argue that 60 days is not enough, particularly for certain types of funds? That depending upon the issuer, for instance, it can take far longer to purchase or sell a position without tipping their hand and increasing costs?</li>
<li class="pf0">Funds may be able to shield strategies from prying eyes for a year by &ldquo;report[ing] as &lsquo;miscellaneous securities&rsquo; an aggregate amount of portfolio investments that does not exceed 5% of the total value of the fund&rsquo;s portfolio investments.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Is the 5% ceiling sufficiently high to afford vulnerable funds the level of protection they require to pursue aggressive investing strategies?</li>
<li class="pf0">Today&rsquo;s amendments made up a small portion of the original proposal. As swing pricing and establishing a hard close dominated the discussion, do we feel that commenters had sufficient opportunity to weigh in on the costs associated with expedited filing and increased public disclosure? Did we give any thought to re-proposal?</li>
<li class="pf0">What are the plans for conducting a retrospective review to understand the effects of this rulemaking?</li>
</ol>

In the intervening years, the SEC has introduced new and complex reporting items related to the derivatives and liquidity risk management rules, and Form N-PORT stands to grow further in complexity in light of recent SEC proposals (such as the Names Rule proposal). Moreover, numerous reporting items on Form N-PORT require the use of significant judgment in the analyses necessary to produce the reports. These changes, their complexity, and the judgment that the form requires mean that data quality reviews are an increasingly important part of the process, both for reporting funds (who want to avoid errors) and for the SEC (for which data integrity is undoubtedly important). Accordingly, the SEC should allow at least 45 days after month end for filing Form N-PORT in order to permit appropriate data review and correction and reduce the potential for errors in reporting.&rdquo;)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-26-22/s72622-20157331-325678.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-26-22/s72622-20157331-325678.pdf</a>.

The increased data required in Form N-PORT filings, and such data&rsquo;s complexity, make the review of such data all the more important and challenging. To help ensure sufficient time for appropriate data reviews and pre-filing error corrections, and in order to prevent immaterial inconsistencies between a fund&rsquo;s Form N-PORT and Form N-CSR filings for periods with the same end date (which could result in unnecessary uncertainty and create inefficiencies), we would recommend a more extended Form N-PORT filing deadline after month end, such as 45 days generally and 60 days for any periods for which a Form N-CSR will be filed.&rdquo;)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-26-22/s72622-20157189-325524.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-26-22/s72622-20157189-325524.pdf</a>.

<title>Statement On Amendments To Forms N-PORT And N-CEN Reporting And Guidance On Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Aug. 28, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Form N-Port, liquidity rules, public reporting, transparency, guidance<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC updates Form N-Port for more frequent reporting. Funds must make monthly portfolio holdings public. Guidance on liquidity rules provided. <div>
<p>Today the Commission addresses several important matters.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Most prominently, we update Form N-Port.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;N-PORT collects core information from registered investment companies about funds and their portfolio holdings &ndash; including information about counterparty and sector exposure, liquidity, volatility risk, leverage, and net asset value.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;It provides the Commission with critical data, especially in times of market stress. The problem with the Form as it exists right now is the infrequency of reporting.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments are aimed at fixing this timing issue.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Getting data on a more frequent basis means that, when there is potential for market disruptions &ndash; like those resulting from Covid, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of the Ukraine, the LIBOR transition, or regional bank failures &ndash; our staff will be armed with current and critical data to assess rapidly developing situations and craft targeted responses, instead of either relying on information that is up to 5 months stale, or starting anew by sending out mass data requests to registrants at a time that could require immediate action. We need sharp tools to protect investors and markets when circumstances are most volatile, not tools dulled by the passage of time. Putting current fund data into the hands of our capable staff to help avoid mass investor harm is a step that I&rsquo;m happy to support. More generally, the provision of data on an improved timeline will enhance our oversight and monitoring of funds, even in non-volatile times.</p>
<p>Likewise, today&rsquo;s amendments will require funds to make public their monthly portfolio holdings 60 days after months-end.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Giving investors the ability to see more information about their holdings in registered funds is common sense to me. This will allow investors to better assess their investments (either on their own or with the help of third parties), make informed decisions about their money and long-term plans, and assess whether fund managers are hewing to their stated investment and risk strategies. Many fund managers currently understand that fund transparency is good for business, as they already voluntarily provide such information. Today&rsquo;s rule will provide investors with conformity, consistency, and clarity.</p>
<p>I understand the concerns that we have heard from certain fund managers relating to difficulties they may encounter in building or liquidating positions, or in copycat trading, as a result of public reporting. The final rule endeavors to mitigate those concerns. For example, there is still a delay in reporting &ndash; that delay has simply been reduced from up-to-5 months to up-to-3 months. Moreover, funds will still have the ability to anonymously build a position up to 5 percent of their portfolio.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And, as always, there will be an opportunity to report back to the Commission on real world experiences after the rule becomes effective.</p>
<p>Additionally, today we provide guidance on liquidity rules for open-end funds. Today&rsquo;s guidance &ndash; relating to the required frequency of liquidity classifications, the definition of cash, and highly liquid investment minimums &ndash; is based on the staff&rsquo;s ongoing observations, outreach and monitoring of the industry.</p>
<p>I support all of the measures we adopt today, which provide for greater transparency to both the Commission and the public, clarity to the industry about their practices, and hopefully, overall, safer and more robust markets.</p>
<p>Thank you to the staff in the Divisions of Investment Management, Economic Risk and Analysis, the General Counsel&rsquo;s office, among many others, who crafted this important release, which helps us fulfill our mission.</p>

<div> Mutual funds, investment companies, portfolio data, timely access, investor protection
Summary:
Current rules provide delayed portfolio data to investors and the Commission, impacting 70 million households. Reforms are deemed an improvement. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Under current rules, registered investment companies, a $28 trillion industry of largely mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, provide the Commission and investors with periodic portfolio holdings data. The Commission relies on this data to assess trends and risks, and to support its rulemaking, examination, and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>Institutional and retail investors benefit from access to the same data that can help them make more informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>The current rules impact approximately 70 million US households.</p>
<p>Concerns about whether data provided under current timelines renders it stale, both for oversight and investment decision purposes, are well-founded.</p>
<p>Delayed information in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical events and other market stresses in recent years, has limited the Commission&rsquo;s timely understanding of the market impacts of these events.</p>
<p>More importantly, investors are left to make decisions with incomplete or outdated information. Data aggregators and other market participants can be a source of some information for investors. And many funds voluntarily post periodic information on their websites or through third parties. But practices vary. The data provided is not standardized, often lacks risk metrics, and may only be available for a fee.</p>
<p>If adopted, reforms that yield more timely fund portfolio information will no doubt help the Commission better assess the impact and risks of market stresses, closer to when they are unfolding.</p>
<p>Relative to the status quo, today&rsquo;s reforms will also offer investors more timely access to data.</p>
<p>But the current framework, where investors gain access to the information much later than the Commission, will remain unchanged. That is, fund information will be made public on a 60-day delay &ndash; leaving investors at a significant disadvantage.</p>
<p>In light of this disparity, I urge that Commission staff explore future amendments to this rule so that investors can benefit from more timely access to fund portfolio data.</p>
<p>As I see it, fulfilling the investor protection part of our mission means elevating the interests of investors, retail investors in particular, to the forefront.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reforms fall short of that. But I will support them because, taken together and on balance, these reforms represent an improvement over the current rule.</p>

This thorough modernization of TS Imagine products and services propels TS Imagine users to the cutting edge of innovation within global capital markets.</p>
<h4><i>Highlights of TS Imagine Platform 3.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;</i></h4>
<h4 class="elementToProof"><b>Massive expansion of data coverage and integration with Snowflake</b></h4>
<p>Over the past three years, TS Imagine established a dedicated data and analytics function and recruited a global team of data experts who delivered an extensive expansion of data coverage seamlessly integrated in&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="OWAAutoLink safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.snowflake.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Snowflake</a></span></span>. They drove the merging of data sources, datasets, interfaces and data management processes.

<p>The expanded data set provides unparalleled price discovery and liquidity access, including a cross-asset class liquidity network encompassing over 300 endpoints. New users receive immediate access to all asset classes on their first day of usage, and client service teams are more wholistically informed.</p>
<p>The transformation creates efficiencies and significantly lowers the total cost of ownership for users. In fixed income specifically, there are tangible benefits such as new issue bonds being available within TradeSmart Fixed Income EMS on or before the auction day, providing a significant advantage for users navigating global bond markets.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Embedded AI for continuous insights and faster, more precise decision making&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p>Platform 3.0 introduces AI into TS Imagine products across trading and risk management. AI converts unstructured data into structured data primed for machine learning and automation. The automation provides users access to a broad set of data in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Users benefit from intraday insights produced by AI-driven automation, empowering them to optimize their workflows and make rapid decisions supported by real-time data and analytics. Additional research and development continue as breakthroughs in AI transform the financial technology landscape.</p>
<h4><b>Automation and liquidity sourcing tools within TradeSmart EMS streamline trading workflows</b></h4>
<p>Platform 3.0 includes the integration of AutoRoute, an advanced EMS automation tool designed to simplify and enhance order flow management. AutoRoute automatically routes orders to block venues, automatically assigns orders to brokers and traders, and much more. The automation tools also allow traders to automatically classify trades and customize rules for workflow efficiency. Compliance with regulations such as the Best Execution Rule can automated.</p>
<h4 class="elementToProof"><b>Increased data coverage aligns with advances in electronic fixed income trading and the growing need for financial risk management in commodities markets</b></h4>
<p>Platform 3.0 delivers an even wider range of instruments to traders and their teams in more asset classes. With the data expansion, TS Imagine products cover over 20 million financial instruments, including all listed securities and bonds from terms and conditions of a financial instrument to quantitative data structures including yield curves, volatility surfaces and time series.</p>
<p>The expansion allows fixed-income traders and their teams to diversify their trading strategies and access new markets including municipal bonds. This access gives a clear competitive advantage by expanding their opportunity set. Other new asset classes within TS Imagine&rsquo;s platform include warrants, structured products and derivatives.</p>
<h4 class="elementToProof"><b>Advanced financial risk management for buy-and sell-side firms</b></h4>
<p>Platform 3.0 significantly fortifies the comprehensive financial risk management solutions within Risk Smart + and RiskSmart X, allowing users to manage and mitigate their financial market risk, and safeguard their investments better and more effectively. In RiskSmart X, the industry&rsquo;s most comprehensive margin calculator tool prepares sell-side financial institutions to defend and challenge margin calls during extreme volatility. Small and mid-sized investment firms using TS One can view live analytics via a seamless front end which also includes end of day calculations such as VaR. Throughout both RiskSmart solutions, automation powers the delivery of fresh, accurate P&amp;L vectors at the start of each trading day.</p>
<h4 class="elementToProof"><b>Post-trade transaction management and control &nbsp;</b></h4>
<p>Platform 3.0 features robust post-trade transaction management and reporting, including automated, detailed tracking of trade history and validation of best execution against hundreds of benchmarks optimized for transaction cost analysis (TCA). The post-trade functionality allows users to automatically maintain accurate records, streamlining their post-trade processes, and allowing for more control over compliance processes.</p>
<h4 class="elementToProof"><b>Flex-packaging of components to deliver sophisticated trading and risk management tools to small and mid-sized investment firms</b></h4>
<p>Through TS One, small and mid-sized investment firms access the same tools used by the world&rsquo;s most sophisticated investors. Platform 3.0 delivers these tools within modules representing important operational functions such as compliance, accounting and risk. The modules allow users to customize their technology stacks according to their unique requirements, and to add modules as they grow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement On Form N-PORT And Form N-CEN Reporting Amendments - Guidance On Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Aug. 28, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> liquidity risk management, Form N-PORT, public disclosure, fund investment, regulatory transparency <br />
Summary: The SEC proposed changes to Form N-PORT and N-CEN, requiring more frequent public disclosure, causing concern for fund investment and market diversity. <br /> <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler. The recommendation before the Commission is to adopt certain changes to Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;and to provide guidance to funds on certain aspects of their liquidity risk management programs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Form N-PORT was adopted in 2016 and made important changes to the information collected by the Commission about funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Form N-PORT requires funds to report individual portfolio holdings, risk metric calculations, and other information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Currently, funds file Form N-PORT for each month in a fiscal quarter within 60 days of the end of that quarter. The third month of each fiscal quarter is made available to the public, while the first and second months remain confidential.</p>
<p>In response to financial stability concerns, there has been an increased demand by prudential regulators to know market-wide positions held across funds in recent years. Today&rsquo;s amendments would require this information to be reported to the Commission within 30 days after the end of each calendar month, providing faster regulatory transparency into fund holdings and information based on timing that is not dependent on a fund&rsquo;s fiscal quarter. Had these amendments been limited to such regulatory transparency, I could have supported them.</p>
<p>However, the amendments also require that monthly Form N-PORT&rsquo;s information be made available to the public 60 days after month end. This means detailed fund holdings will be made publicly available twelve times per year.</p>
<p>Why does the difference between regulatory transparency and public transparency matter? Why does the difference between twelve public data points versus four public data points matter? It is because fund portfolios represent the intellectual work product of investment advisers. Thus, the idea that fund advisers need to provide their investment ideas to the general public for free is highly concerning. If fund investment advisers are not compensated for their skill in conducting fundamental investment research and effective trading strategies, then such efforts will be less likely to occur at all &ndash; and the public good of price discovery will be significantly harmed.</p>
<p>The Commission has not adequately justified the decision to substantially increase the frequency of public disclosure of Form N-PORT data and makes only cursory efforts to reverse a policy considered less than eight years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Commenters, including asset managers that pursue an active management investment style, raised substantial concerns about the harmful effects that such public disclosure could have on fund investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;For example, asset managers that follow a value style may take months to build a position as their decisions are based on narrow predetermined price ranges.</p>
<p>Similarly, some funds may have a focused portfolio consisting of a handful of companies, in which each investment decision is highly impactful. As such, public disclosure of Form N-PORT data raises the risk of predatory trading, where the manager&rsquo;s careful investment decisions can be easily and cheaply copied.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Further, I am concerned that more frequent disclosure of portfolio holdings can put the fund at a disadvantage relative to other investment pools that compete in the same markets, such as hedge funds, family offices, and collective investment trusts, that are not subject to these requirements, not to mention separately managed accounts. This may be particularly acute for funds that invest in high yield bonds, where counterparties and other market participants may seek to benefit from the information that a fund is building or selling a position, thus exposing the fund to wider bid-ask spreads and lowered performance.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s decision to minimize these concerns is puzzling. Form N-PORT, as the Commission has repeatedly observed, is primarily designed to assist the Commission and its staff.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;It is not retail investor friendly. Instead, the Commission believes that individual investors will benefit from third-party service providers that aggregate and analyze the data for a fee, as well as the efforts of academics.</p>
<p>The Commission summarily dismisses the concern that a fund&rsquo;s portfolio could be copied &ndash; merely because of the 60-day lag &ndash; and points to the fact that some funds voluntarily disclose portfolio holdings on their websites in support of more frequent public disclosure. However, the information that funds publish on their websites is not the same as required on Form N-PORT; it may consist solely of top ten holdings, or exposures to different sectors. Form N-PORT information includes not only all of the fund&rsquo;s portfolio holdings but also information on risk metrics and other data. But more importantly, just because&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span>&nbsp;funds have decided that the benefits of public disclosure outweigh the harm does not mean that we should mandate more frequent disclosure for&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span>&nbsp;funds.</p>
<p>These concerns are heightened given advances in artificial intelligence, the availability of fractional shares and the ability to buy and sell them through electronic trading platforms with no commissions, and the increased use of structured data, including as required by the Financial Data Transparency Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;This means that it might be even easier in the future to copy the investment strategy of a successful fund manager. Artificial intelligence could peruse the monthly holdings of all funds using structured data and automatically follow the fund adviser with the best performance at the moment. Mobile apps from brokerage platforms can offer the ability to hold a portfolio that mimics one&rsquo;s favorite investment manager using fractional shares and zero commissions, avoiding the payment of any fund fees to do so.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Commission assumes that public disclosure of monthly portfolio holdings may benefit fund investors. I do not think that is true. What is my basis for this belief? It stems from my involvement as the Assistant Director for Disclosure Regulation in the Division of Investment Management, when I participated in extensive investor testing of information contained in fund shareholder reports. The results were not surprising. Fund investors were most interested in performance and they were far less interested in a complete listing of portfolio holdings. Many fund investors were more interested in understanding portfolio holdings by category, which is information that is not even disclosed in Form N-PORT. I highly doubt those investor views have changed since then. But if the Commission wanted to know, it could have conducted a new round of investor testing before charging ahead today.</p>
<p>In fact, fund investors could be harmed by increased trading costs, as managers may try to concentrate their trading activity within a shorter time frame or otherwise change their strategies to protect fund shareholders from the effects of predatory trading or less favorable bid-ask spreads. This may result in decreased fund performance which could cause these fund investors to redeem from these funds and could lead to the fund&rsquo;s eventual liquidation. When an investor can obtain the same portfolio exposures as a fund manager for free, what is the incentive for the investor to invest in the fund?</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s decision to require more frequent public disclosure of certain Form N-PORT information may have broader, unwelcome implications for investor choice and the diversity of our markets. Index funds and index-based investing have grown in popularity, and actively-managed fund assets may be declining.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Some of this decline may be to market forces. It can be difficult to compete with index funds with enormous economies of scale that can be managed at low cost.</p>
<p>In this regard, I have repeatedly voiced my concerns that the rules imposed over the past three years can have a disproportionate effect on smaller asset managers, which include many active managers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Whether intended or not, the Commission should not be implementing a regulatory regime that favors passive investment strategies over active management strategies.</p>
<p>Lastly, I reject the premise that frequent public disclosure of consistent information made available for all funds is a &ldquo;public good.&rdquo; The capital markets function efficiently because there are financial incentives to conduct value-adding fundamental research for securities and their prices, which is one reason for the very existence of fund investment managers. The results are the intellectual work product of the fund manager and its skill; that information is not a public good to which everyone may have access for free, while the active management itself&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span>&nbsp;a public good given that it contributes to price discovery. Thus, with this rulemaking we run the danger of undermining the public good at issue here.</p>
<p>Although I cannot support this rulemaking, I appreciate the efforts of the staff of the Divisions of Investment Management, and Economic and Risk Analysis, as well as the Office of the General Counsel. I also recognize the efforts of other offices that have contributed to this rulemaking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div> amendments, reporting, requirements, investment, transparency
<br />
The Commission is considering amendments to reporting requirements for funds to provide more transparent and frequent portfolio data.
<br /><br />Summary: The amendments aim to provide more transparency and frequent portfolio data for funds, benefiting investors and the Commission's oversight of the asset management industry. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today, the Commission is considering amendments to reporting requirements for registered mutual funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds (&ldquo;funds&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I am pleased to support this adoption because it will benefit investors through greater transparency of funds&rsquo; investment portfolios and improve the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of the asset management industry.</p>
<p>Adam Smith, known as the father of modern economics, noted in The Wealth of Nations more than 200 years ago that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free. Smith&rsquo;s maxim is relevant every day in our modern capital markets.</p>
<p>Reliable, accessible data benefits everyone. No one private entity, though, has the incentive to create a database with reliable, comparable, and accessible data, even if they themselves may benefit. Thus, such data is a public good.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Similarly, consistent, accessible information for funds is a public good.</p>
<p>I believe the Commission understood this back in 2004, in requiring that funds&rsquo; investment portfolios be provided to investors on a quarterly basis.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-form-n-port-amendments-082824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Twenty years later, life moves so much more quickly.</p>
<p>By making portfolio data available more frequently to the public, the amendments will enhance investors&rsquo; ability to review and monitor their funds. For instance, investors could more regularly assess how their funds are meeting their investment objectives, and to what extent their funds&rsquo; portfolios overlap.</p>
<p>The amendments also provide the Commission with timelier information. As the primary regulator of the asset management industry, the Commission relies on such information in its oversight. Increasing the timeliness of the reports helps the Commission monitor industry trends, identify risks, inform policy and rulemaking, and examination and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>More timely fund data is particularly important in enhancing the Commission&rsquo;s ability to respond during times of stress or fast-moving events. Lest we need any reminders, the past few years have brought disruptions in markets, reacting to the start of COVID-19, wars abroad, and major bank failures.</p>
<p>The amendments balance the benefits of timelier information with the desire to protect sensitive data. Consistent with the current rule, information will be made public only 60 days after the period. Thus, funds will have two months before information reaches the public.</p>
<p>Additionally, the adopting release provides guidance related to an existing rule that requires open-end funds to have liquidity risk management programs. Since that rule was implemented, Commission staff has monitored funds&rsquo; liquidity classifications and observed funds&rsquo; liquidity risk management programs in practice, including during the market stress event in March 2020.</p>
<p>The guidance addresses questions raised through this staff outreach and monitoring. It also reflects the importance of our staff observing how rules work in practice and providing guidance where appropriate based on these observations.</p>
<p>These amendments will provide more public information for investors and the Commission. As Adam Smith said, this information will better protect investors and protect the public good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on this adopting release, including:</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Reporting Enhancements For Registered Investment Companies And Provides Guidance On Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs</title>

<div> amendments, Form N-PORT, reporting requirements, SEC, investment companies
Summary:
SEC adopted amendments to Form N-PORT reporting requirements for investment companies to provide more timely and transparent information to investors and enhance regulatory oversight. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted amendments to reporting requirements on Form N-PORT to provide the Commission and investors with more timely information about certain registered investment companies (funds). Form N-PORT reports provide important information about a fund&rsquo;s portfolio holdings and related information to help assess a fund&rsquo;s risks. The amendments will provide the Commission with timelier information about funds&rsquo; portfolio investments, which will promote more effective regulatory monitoring and oversight of the fund industry for the benefit of fund investors.&nbsp;The amendments also will triple the amount of Form N-PORT data available to investors in a given year, enhancing investors&rsquo; ability to review and monitor information about their funds&rsquo; portfolios.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reliable, accessible data benefits everyone,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;These amendments will benefit investors through greater transparency of funds&rsquo; investment portfolios and improve the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of the asset management industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Form N-PORT amendments will require funds that are required to report on the form&mdash;generally registered open-end funds, registered closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds organized as unit investment trusts&mdash;to file reports on Form N-PORT on a monthly basis within 30 days after the end of the month to which they relate. Currently, funds file these monthly reports on a quarterly basis within 60 days after quarter-end. The amendments will also make funds&rsquo; monthly reports on Form N-PORT available to the public 60 days after the end of each month instead of every third month of a quarter only.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission adopted reporting amendments and provided guidance related to open-end fund liquidity risk management program requirements. Specifically, the Commission adopted amendments to Form N-CEN requiring open-end funds to report certain information about service providers used to fulfill liquidity risk management program requirements so that the Commission can track certain liquidity risk management practices. The Commission also provided guidance related to certain aspects of open-end fund liquidity risk management program requirements to address questions raised through outreach and monitoring.</p>
<p>The amendments to Forms N-PORT and N-CEN will become effective on November 17, 2025. Funds generally will be required to comply with the amendments for reports filed on or after that date, except that fund groups with net assets of less than $1 billion will have until May 18, 2026, to comply with the Form N-PORT amendments.</p>

<div> wheat, futures, spread, contracts, CME Group
Summary:<br />CME Group to launch new wheat spread futures contracts in USD, allowing clients to manage price exposure efficiently and trade in a single currency. <div>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that it will launch two new wheat spread futures contracts on&nbsp;October 14, pending regulatory review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CBOT Wheat - Euronext Milling Wheat No. 2 Spread futures contract and the KC HRW Wheat - Euronext Milling Wheat No. 2 Spread futures contract will each be&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;dollar-denominated in metric tons and based on the spread between either CBOT Wheat futures prices or KC HRW Wheat futures prices and Euronext Milling Wheat No. 2 futures prices.</p>
<p>"As the wheat trade becomes increasingly global and interlinked, we are pleased to provide our clients with innovative new tools to manage their wheat price exposure more efficiently," said&nbsp;
John Ricci, Managing Director and Global Head of Agriculture Products at&nbsp;CME Group. "These new spread futures contracts will eliminate the need to transact and clear on multiple venues, allow clients to trade these products in a single currency and expand access to these important benchmark markets."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new spread futures will be listed by and subject to the rules of CBOT. For contract specifications, or for more information on&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;wheat benchmarks, please visit here: &nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4241370-1&amp;h=2602333423&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2Fwheatspread&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2Fwheatspread" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cmegroup.com/wheatspread</a>.</p>

<title>Euronext Announces The Launch Of Spread Contracts On Agricultural Commodities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-announces-the-launch-of-spread-contracts-on-agricultural-commodities/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-announces-the-launch-of-spread-contracts-on-agricultural-commodities/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Euronext, spread contracts, agricultural commodities, trading, futures
Summary:<br />Euronext introduces spread contracts on agricultural commodities, reducing transaction costs, execution risks, and margin requirements, bringing more liquidity to their markets. <div>
<ul>
<li>First spread contracts to be introduced on Euronext markets </li>
<li>The spread contracts, traded on Optiq&reg; and cleared by Euronext Clearing, will be launched on 14 October 2024 </li>
<li>Two spread contracts will be based on the price differential between Euronext-listed and CME Group-listed wheat futures </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Euronext today announced the upcoming launch, pending regulatory review, of three spread contracts on agricultural commodities. Spread contracts are financially-settled futures contracts whose underlying is a price differential between two different products, and in this case two different futures. The spread contracts will start trading on 14 October 2024.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The three spread contracts have the following underlying products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Euronext Milling Wheat no.2 Futures&nbsp;<span>vs</span>&nbsp;CBOT Wheat Futures</li>
<li>Euronext Milling Wheat no.2 Futures&nbsp;<span>vs</span>&nbsp;CBOT KC HRW Wheat Futures</li>
<li>Euronext Milling Wheat no.2 Futures&nbsp;<span>vs</span>&nbsp;Euronext Corn Futures</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">There will be four expiries per year for each spread contract, referring to the months of March, May, September and December. At launch, five expiries will be available for trading, from December 2024 to December 2025.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">USD-denominated versions of the two spread contracts based on the price differential between Euronext-listed and CME Group-listed wheat futures will be launched on and subject to the rules of the Chicago Board of Trade (&ldquo;CBOT&rdquo;) on the same day.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Until now, market participants had to trade the different futures contracts separately, executing a spread strategy in two inverse trades on each outright. The listed spread contracts launched by Euronext will allow financial investors and hedgers to execute a spread strategy in one trade only, bringing significant benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce transaction costs, as investors and hedgers will no longer have to trade two different products but one single contract.</li>
<li>Mitigate execution risks and avoid a situation where they see only one of their orders executed, leaving them with an unwanted exposure.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Gain visibility or even avoid foreign-currency risks that arise when trading a spread strategy between CME Group-listed and Euronext-listed futures.</li>
<li>Unlock margin efficiencies, as traders can expect lower margins for a spread contract compared to trading each leg individually, in particular when the legs are cleared by different exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Camille Beudin,&nbsp;Head of Diversified Services&nbsp;at Euronext, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Euronext is pleased to announce the upcoming launch of spread contracts on agricultural commodities. As the first spread contracts ever listed on Euronext, they emphasise our&nbsp;</em>commitment<em>&nbsp;to constantly innovate on our markets and enable our clients to deploy their trading and hedging strategies. This is another demonstration of how Euronext can leverage its full value chain with a presence in trading and clearing, shortly after the migration of the clearing of agricultural commodities to Euronext Clearing in July 2024. This easier, more cost-efficient and less risky way of trading spreads between CME Group and Euronext should attract more investors from different regions and will bring American and European wheat trading communities closer, bringing additional volume and liquidity to Euronext markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> insurance, FCA, market study, pure protection, commission arrangements <br />
The FCA plans a market study on how pure protection insurance is sold, concerned about poor value and commission arrangements. Consumers' needs and fair value are priorities.<br /><br />Summary: The FCA is launching a study into the sale of pure protection insurance products amid concerns about poor value and commission arrangements. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA intends to launch a market study into how pure protection insurance products are sold following concerns that competition is not working well in the market. The study will be launched later in 2024/25.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Pure protection products are designed to help individuals and their families with their finances should the policyholder die or become unable to meet their financial commitments. Around &pound;4 billion was paid out in claims in 2022. The products are mainly sold through intermediaries like independent financial advisers or mortgage brokers.</p>
<p>The FCA has concerns that the design of commission arrangements may not allow firms to deliver good outcomes to policyholders. The regulator is also concerned that some products may be providing poor value, for example if the total premiums paid over a lifetime far exceed the maximum conceivable payout.</p>
<p>In order to understand how the market is working the FCA will explore consumers&rsquo; engagement with and understanding of the products they are buying, the competitive constraints on insurers and intermediaries, and potential conflicts of interest in the structure of commission.</p>
<p>The FCA will focus primarily on the sale of 4 specific types of products &ndash; term assurance, critical illness cover, income protection insurance and whole of life insurance including policies for over 50s that offer guaranteed acceptance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Pure protection can offer peace of mind and financial security, often when people are at their most vulnerable. Consumers should be able to buy products which meet their needs and provide fair value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We have seen indications that this may not be the case across the pure protection market and we will act if we find that the market is not working well.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is keen to hear any feedback on its Terms of Reference and, ahead of launching the market study, will engage with firms, industry groups and others to gather views on the market and the issues we propose to examine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-1-1-market-distribution-pure-protection" title="MS24/1.1: Pure Protection Market Study">Market Study MS24/1.1: Market study into the Distribution of Pure Protection Products to Retail Customers - Proposed Terms of Reference.</a></li>
<li>Term assurance: a policy which pays a lump sum to beneficiaries if the policyholder dies within a specified period.</li>
<li>Critical illness cover: a policy which pays a lump sum to the policyholder if they are diagnosed with a prescribed (non-fatal) serious illness or medical condition.</li>
<li>Income protection insurance: a policy which replaces part of a policyholder&rsquo;s regular income if they become unable to work because of illness, accident, or disability.</li>
<li>Whole of life insurance, including guaranteed acceptance over 50s life insurance plans: these policies provide cover for the policyholder&rsquo;s lifetime, paying out a lump sum to beneficiaries on the policyholder&rsquo;s death. Guaranteed acceptance is a type of whole of life insurance which doesn&rsquo;t require medical or health information for an individual to qualify for cover.</li>

<div> partnership, fintech, interlinking, global payments, fast payment systems
Summary:<br />Public-private partnership for fintech innovation, interlinking fast payment systems globally, challenges of cross-border payments, importance of central bank coordination, need for continued research and experimentation.<br /> <div>
<p>Thank you to the conference organizers for the opportunity to speak this year at the Global Fintech Fest&mdash;a place where there is so much payments innovation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240828a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The technology-driven payments revolution in India has been enabled by a public-private partnership to build the "technology stack" of digital platforms that has broadened financial inclusion and done so at low costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240828a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Building on the foundation established by the public sector, innovators in the private sector seized the opportunity to enhance payments through the introduction of new capabilities that alleviate frictions while remaining within regulatory guardrails. In today's remarks, I am going to touch on how interplay between the public and private sectors may be the key to advancing cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Now that fast payment systems have been established around much of the globe&mdash;in over 70 countries and climbing&mdash;attention is turning to how these newer systems could potentially enhance global payments. Specifically, interlinking fast payment systems has been identified as a possible means to deliver enhanced cross-border payments for consumers and businesses. Interlinking arrangements would allow banks in different countries who are users of domestic fast payment systems to send payments to each other through technical connections between their respective domestic systems. As you all know, interlinking is one of the areas outlined in the G20 roadmap for further exploration as part of a holistic effort to enhance cross-border payments. The overarching G20 goal is to mitigate challenges with cross-border payments in a coordinated way at a global level, with input from key stakeholders including the private sector.</p>
<p>The G20 roadmap addresses a new topic that payments industry stakeholders have been circling around for years&mdash;more cost-effective and timely cross-border payments for consumers and businesses. This policy goal has been advanced by the Federal Reserve over time in various payment system improvement initiatives, dating back to the late 1990s when the Federal Reserve began adapting the automated clearinghouse (ACH) service to support international payments, and more recently in 2015 when we collaborated with industry to improve the payment system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240828a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Today's consumers and businesses can generally send a payment anywhere in the world, but they all seem to want faster and cheaper global payments, just like we always want faster flights and cheaper airfares. However, I am not entirely convinced that interlinking arrangements will necessarily deliver on those goals. Let me explain with some context.</p>
<p><strong>Faster and cheaper cross-border payments</strong><br />Not all frictions that slow payments down are bad. Certain frictions are purposely built into the global payment system for compliance and risk-management reasons. Slowing down the speed at which payments are cleared and settled helps banks prevent money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism, detect fraud, and recover fraudulent or misdirected cross-border payments. Granted, the practice today of sending payments through an often complex chain of correspondent banks contributes to slower payments that could benefit from efficiency enhancements. However, there is no silver bullet that increases speed and efficiency without tradeoffs. Unless new solutions are found, interlinking fast payment systems might increase the risk-management burden for banks that participate in them. That is, legal, compliance, and operational considerations are critical to the discussion of the promise and challenges of interlinking. Governance, oversight, and settlement arrangements also need to be thought through, along with considerations for data privacy.</p>
<p>In addition, can we assume that all parties to a cross-border transaction want faster payments? The fundamental friction in any transaction is that the seller of an object&mdash;a can of soup, an hour of labor, or a good manufactured for export&mdash;wants to receive their money as fast as possible. However, the buyer of the object, or the buyer's intermediary, typically has an incentive to wait as long as they can to pay for something they have purchased. Under this logic, senders need to be properly incentivized to speed up cross-border payments. The one exception may be person-to-person remittances, where workers from other countries want to send money home, and recipients want access, as fast as possible. But remittances are only a small percentage of the value of cross-border payments, so we'd need to weigh the benefits against the costs of a potential public-sector intervention to shift incentives. So, I am still left with the larger question of whether we should be incentivizing faster cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Suppose we do want to incentivize senders by lowering costs of faster payments&mdash;whose responsibility is it to do that? Should it be left to private-sector competition to drive down costs as is typically the case with other products? Or is there something unique about payments that requires central banks or payment system operators to step in to interlink their networks with the goal of bringing costs down? We have already seen examples of the private sector leveraging technology to innovate in the market for cross-border instant payments, both at the wholesale and retail level. For example, we have seen a real-time payment system built for wholesale clients that allows clearing and settlement between global clients in seconds, with necessary compliance performed upfront in less than 24 hours. Another example is the SWIFT Global Payments Innovation, which offers improved speed and transparency for the business customers of participating banks, and, by their account, has been adopted by 150 banks globally. In mentioning these examples, I am not intending to endorse certain private-sector services. Rather, these newer services are illustrative of how market forces and competition can meet consumer and business demands for more efficient cross-border payments.</p>
<p>In the United States we have experience with offering low-cost international ACH payments. We provided direct ACH linkages from the United States to Europe and Canada, but after more than 20 years, the banks were not using it, and we stopped the service. It is possible that a fast payment interlinking arrangement adopted by Federal Reserve would be more effective for our bank customers than the former ACH service, but we would proceed cautiously to carefully consider the costs and benefits. Economic viability needs to be a cornerstone for any action we may take. We need to ask ourselves whether banks would find a central bank interlinking service more effective than their existing arrangements for cross-border payments, and if they would actually use it.</p>
<p><strong>Practical aspects of interlinking fast payment systems</strong><br />We know from basic economic theory that payment systems are similar to other networks in that greater participation is necessary for the network to grow and increase value to its users. This is true on a global scale, too, which in practical terms means that valuable global interlinked networks would have to be founded on underlying domestic networks with a breadth of senders and receivers. Domestic networks need to be developed first. If this condition is not in place, interlinked networks could end up being a road to nowhere.</p>
<p>Building out domestic networks has been done in different ways. In some countries the central bank has authority to mandate participation, notably in Brazil with the successful Pix system. In other countries, notably India, united efforts by the government, central bank, and private sector established the digital public infrastructure that enabled broad adoption.</p>
<p>In the United States, it's a different story, and the payments landscape is unique. With over 9,000 depository institutions and different authorities than other countries, the Federal Reserve determined that it needed to build a fast payment system accessible to all depository institutions to achieve our policy goals. At the time of our decision, there was only one private-sector instant payment system in the market, built by the largest banks. Based on our experience, we did not believe that this system would ultimately reach all depository institutions, nor would other private-sector systems emerge to compete with it and extend the scope of that service. Yet we knew from industry engagement that smaller banks across the country wanted a broadly accessible fast payment system, so we stepped in to address the clear coordination problem. This action is very much consistent with the Federal Reserve's role in the U.S. payment system historically.</p>
<p>We have seen widespread adoption of the FedNow Service in just a little over a year since implementation, with close to 1,000 depository institutions on the network including many of the largest banks that will drive origination volume. Yet we are still at the beginning of a multiyear journey of establishing a ubiquitous network covering the majority of institutions in our country. Variation around the world in domestic fast payment network adoption means that the value of globally interlinked systems is not yet clear.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the promise of interlinking, which is essentially interoperability between or among domestic fast payment systems, is that fast payment networks can just "connect"' with each other and move payments globally. It sounds simple. In practice, however, achieving interoperability is not simple. Technology is probably the easiest part. The legal, compliance, settlement, and governance challenges I mentioned earlier are more substantial. In addition, even when technological connections are in place, payments may not actually be instant as they traverse across systems because of domestic variations in ISO 20022 implementation, which is the global standard used by most fast payment systems. To send an ISO message seamlessly from one country to another across a technical link, operators need to coordinate and align on common practices.</p>
<p>We should consider that new multilateral arrangements for interlinking could potentially address some of the challenges that I have outlined. Today, certain countries have established bilateral links between domestic fast payment systems primarily to support remittance payments. These arrangements demonstrate that linkages are technically possible and that legal and compliance issues can be addressed. Yet each link is unique and requires resource-intensive negotiation and alignment between parties. Establishing bilateral links across the globe simply will not scale. We know this to be true from our own bilateral ACH linkages, where each arrangement required bespoke agreements with correspondent banks and service providers. Multilateral arrangements might bring some efficiencies, yet they are no small undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />To sum up, overall, I do see the value of a coordination role for the public sector to improve cross-border payments, an effort in which the Federal Reserve has been and will continue to be heavily engaged. We will continue our engagement with international fora to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments and to investigate the issues critical to interlinking payment systems. Our chief focus in the near-to mid-term, however, is continuing to build the FedNow network domestically and increasing participation in the service. We are also improving existing cross-border rails by considering expanded operating hours on our large-value, real-time gross settlement system, the Fedwire Funds Service, and by adopting ISO 20022, a globally accepted messaging standard. Looking out over the longer term, we will continue to conduct research and experimentation on emerging technologies to better understand the role these innovations could play in the payments landscape of the future. I expect the technical capabilities, legal infrastructure, and use cases for faster cross-border payments will evolve, and I look forward to following the private-sector innovation that will emerge from stakeholders represented at this event.</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Commercial End-User Enforcement Action</title>

<div> accusations, CFTC, evidence, trading, manipulation
Summary:
Accusations of lacking evidence in CFTC case, concern over impact on commercial hedging, lack of complete administrative record, undermining of fair adjudication. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent on&nbsp;<i>In re TOTSA TotalEnergies Trading SA</i>&nbsp;because of the lack of evidence to support the alleged charges and the consequences of asserting that legitimate commercial hedging activity is illegal. Over the past several years, the pocketbooks of Americans and consumers all over the world have been hit hard by inflation and policies that have resulted in higher gas prices and tough choices for many families. Today, the CFTC is continuing down this road of anti-energy policies by relying on flimsy evidence that is speculative and circumstantial, on the one hand, and failing to account for the substantial evidence of market conditions and fundamentals driving supply and demand in European physical gasoline markets, on the other hand.&nbsp;Levying such a charge against a non-U.S. energy producer is no small matter and underscores the importance for the CFTC&mdash;or any other government agency&mdash;to know what it is doing and understand the facts before it makes allegations of attempted market manipulation and imposes fines of tens of millions of dollars.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This case is a textbook example of policymakers with no industry experience second-guessing commercial business decisions in a bubble. It is undisputed that there is no evidence of artificial prices in this case. Instead of accepting that, the CFTC has once again brought the immense power of the U.S. government to bear down and obtain a settlement by misapplying the CFTC&rsquo;s broad Dodd-Frank anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authorities. Far from using these new authorities as intended to go after abusive trading practices in the swaps market, the CFTC instead has used them as a blank check to go after commercial producers and merchants in the cash markets. This approach is the opposite of the CFTC&rsquo;s original mandate to promote price discovery and hedging in commodity markets, and will actively discourage commercial end-users from appropriately managing their risks with the use of exchange-traded futures.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Overall, upon reviewing the administrative record, including a previously unrevealed white paper and expert reports, I am seriously concerned about the lack of direct evidence in the CFTC&rsquo;s case, and the reliance on speculative, circumstantial evidence to support the alleged charges of attempted manipulation without refuting the evidence that supports the defense.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Importantly, from a policy perspective, I am seriously concerned about the impact that this speaking order will have on restricting the ability of commercial end-users to use derivatives markets for legitimate commercial hedging activity to manage their risks in a volatile geopolitical landscape and volatile energy markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Incomplete Administrative Record</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a threshold matter, it should be a grave concern to the Commission that Respondent&rsquo;s white paper and exhibits of multiple expert reports were not included in the administrative record presented to the Commission for adjudication in this administrative proceeding. Clearly, Respondent&rsquo;s white paper and expert reports presenting the law and facts are material to the Commission&rsquo;s deliberation and cannot be hidden from view. However, the white paper and expert reports only came to light after inquiries from my office regarding whether Respondent had made any submissions to the Commission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>After my request for Respondent&rsquo;s submissions, I only received Respondent&rsquo;s white paper and expert reports on the afternoon before the Commission&rsquo;s planned meeting for an on-the-record hearing to vote on this enforcement action, with less than 24 hours to review before a potential vote. I do not believe that the other Commissioners received the white paper or expert reports at that time.</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The Respondent&rsquo;s white paper included not just one, but the following&nbsp;<span>three</span>&nbsp;expert witness reports: (1) the former CFTC Chief Economist, (2) a former Deloitte partner and CPA who has led over 500 audits of public and private companies and was a national practice leader, and (3) a former BP gasoline executive and trader.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The continuing irregularities in the Commission&rsquo;s internal procedures are unacceptable and undermines the Commission&rsquo;s ability to fairly adjudicate in its administrative proceedings on enforcement actions because of the lack of a complete administrative record. For the past two years, I have repeatedly raised these concerns internally and then publicly regarding the Commission&rsquo;s internal procedures, and I have proposed numerous improvements as well as a GAO study.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The explanation I received for why the Commission did not initially receive the white paper and expert reports as part of the administrative record is because Respondent did not include a request, such as a footer on the cover page, specifically requesting that the white paper and exhibits be provided to the Commission. I am shocked by this gamesmanship of the investigative and administrative record to hoodwink the Commission. This would never be tolerated by any judge in a court of law. The public should always be treated fairly by the government&mdash;with or without all-caps bold text.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Review of Evidence</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As one example, the direct evidence that was contemporaneous with the alleged manipulative activity does not support the charges, and is consistent with both later expert analysis and the CFTC&rsquo;s own internal analysis regarding physical gasoline market fundamentals underlying supply and demand and Respondent&rsquo;s trading activity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>After I made a request regarding the investigative record, I received evidence of contemporaneous documentation by the TOTSA internal Market Compliance Trade Monitoring team regarding certain trading incidents. When the TOTSA Market Compliance Trade Monitoring team, an independent control function, flagged the high volume of trades in this incident, they performed an investigation into the trade rationale and determined the trading activity was legitimate, as described in Respondent&rsquo;s white paper.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement082724#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The contemporaneous trade surveillance investigation results by the independent Market Compliance Trade Monitoring team were consistent with the independent expert economic analysis performed years later finding that the physical EBOB (a type of European blended gasoline) prices were in line with typical price relationships to comparable benchmarks, and that the volume of Respondent&rsquo;s trading was uncorrelated with price changes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Although the CFTC did not have its own expert report to refute Respondent&rsquo;s experts, the CFTC&rsquo;s own independent analysis of global gasoline market conditions from 2017 to 2018 and the fundamentals driving supply and demand in physical gasoline markets was also consistent with Respondent&rsquo;s white paper and expert reports as to the other potential reasons for legitimate physical gasoline transactions and commercial hedging activity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The review of the other expert reports further provided evidence in the record of a legitimate basis for Respondent&rsquo;s trading activity that is consistent with its commercial business in the gasoline and energy markets.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Ultimately, the CFTC&rsquo;s argument boils down to this belief: a commercial producer can never sell at a discount with a hedge in place. If the CFTC continues to take this approach to global commodity markets, how can any business continue to operate without an investigation hanging over their head?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Actions have consequences, and these consequences do not solely exist within the confines of Washington, D.C. Make no mistake, even though today&rsquo;s action is about a Swiss affiliate of a French company and European gas markets, tomorrow the CFTC could hit closer to home. The CFTC&rsquo;s increasing focus on penalizing cash markets, combined with its disregard for physical market fundamentals, threatens the basic underpinnings of the global flow of commerce and trade. It is not too hard to imagine that this will end up as a future punch to the gut of the millions of Americans who have struggled to keep pace with soaring consumer prices in recent years and will further erode the amount of money that working Americans can take home from each paycheck.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I am proud of the CFTC&rsquo;s aggressive track record of pursuing market manipulation all over the world, and I am proud to have supported those cases during my time as a Commissioner.&nbsp;However, in each of those previous matters, the CFTC had sufficient evidence to support the alleged charges.&nbsp;The burden of proof in any prosecution or enforcement action is on the government. The CFTC has not met that burden here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement082724#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;I find it particularly disturbing that the CFTC accused a Compliance officer of intending to deceive the CFTC and making false statements for not being able to recall events that happened years ago, not knowing what other colleagues may or may not have done, or not being able to mind-read or understand what the CFTC&nbsp; was asking about when the CFTC used the incorrect name for an internal compliance report. I doubt that any person would find such accusations reasonable.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Orders Swiss Energy Trader To Pay $48 Million For Attempted Market Manipulation - TOTSA Attempted To Manipulate The Market For EBOB-Linked Futures Contracts</title>

<div> Violation, CFTC, manipulation, TOTSA, futures <br />
Summary: TOTSA Trading SA was penalized $48 million for attempting to manipulate the EBOB-linked futures market, violating CEA and CFTC regulations. <br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and simultaneously settling charges against&nbsp;TOTSA TotalEnergies Trading SA, formerly known as TOTSA Total Oil Trading SA (TOTSA),&nbsp;for attempting to manipulate the market for EBOB-linked futures contracts in order to benefit its derivatives positions in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. TOTSA is not registered with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The order requires TOTSA to pay a $48 million civil monetary penalty and cease and desist from violating the CEA and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benchmark manipulation is an age-old scheme firms have attempted in many markets,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.&nbsp;&ldquo;In&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;cases&nbsp;over&nbsp;the past&nbsp;20 years, the&nbsp;CFTC&nbsp;has guarded market integrity by detecting and prosecuting these benchmark-related schemes. The scheme in this matter involved an attack on the market integrity of&nbsp;CFTC-regulated futures contracts on gasoline, and this settlement demonstrates such attacks will not be tolerated in any market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>According to the order,&nbsp;TOTSA&nbsp;attempted to manipulate the market for EBOB-linked futures contracts. EBOB is a type of refined gasoline used primarily in automobiles in Europe. A number of energy-trading companies, including TOTSA, blend and sell EBOB gasoline. Futures contracts linked to the price of EBOB trade on CFTC-regulated exchanges. The value of these financially-settled futures contracts is determined based on a benchmark price for physical EBOB that is published by the London-based price-reporting service Argus (Argus EBOB Benchmark). The Argus EBOB Benchmark is based on brokered physical EBOB transactions that are reported to Argus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2018, TOTSA attempted to manipulate this market for EBOB-linked futures by selling physical EBOB in the Argus brokered market at prices below what buyers indicated they would pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;During this month, TOTSA sold more physical EBOB than it had sold in any other previous month.&nbsp;&nbsp;TOTSA&rsquo;s sales constituted more than 60% of the volume transacted by all brokered market participants. TOTSA&rsquo;s transactions were reported to Argus, and incorporated into the Argus EBOB Benchmark. In tandem with these sales of physical EBOB, TOTSA maintained a large short position in March-settled EBOB-linked futures which, because it was a short position, would increase in value if the reported price of EBOB declined.</p>
<p>In an attempt to benefit its EBOB-linked short futures position, TOTSA not only blended and sold large quantities of physical EBOB, but also attempted to sell physical EBOB at prices that were lower than what buyers indicated they were willing to pay. On multiple occasions in March 2018, TOTSA traders maintained an offer to sell EBOB for a price that was lower than another market participant&rsquo;s indicative bid. Essentially, TOTSA&rsquo;s traders were willing to accept less revenue from the company&rsquo;s sales of physical EBOB, in an attempt to depress the reported price of EBOB, and increase TOTSA&rsquo;s overall trading profits (by boosting the value of the company&rsquo;s EBOB-linked short position). This conduct constituted attempted market manipulation in violation of Section 6(c)(1) of the CEA and CFTC Regulation 180.1(a)(1).</p>
<p>In accepting TOTSA&rsquo;s Offer of Settlement, the CFTC recognizes that TOTSA provided some cooperation during the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s (DOE) investigation of this matter. However, TOTSA did not timely produce certain WhatsApp communications DOE requested or adequately preserve these communications following DOE&rsquo;s request, with the result that potentially relevant evidence was unavailable to DOE.</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the&nbsp;Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)&nbsp;and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this action are Jason T. Wright, Jennifer Blakley, Chrystal Gonnella, A. Daniel Ullman II, Paul G. Hayeck, and former staff member Lauren Bennett.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund, which is financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>

<br />
SEC charges QZ Asset, QZ Global, and CEO with $6 million fraud, false promises of investment safety, and listing on Nasdaq.
<br /><br />Summary: 
SEC charges investment adviser and CEO with fraud, false promises, and misuse of SEC's name and processes. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against China-based investment adviser QZ Asset Management Limited a/k/a Qianze Asset Management Limited (QZ Asset), its South Dakota-based holding company QZ Global Limited, and the CEO of both entities, Blake Yeung Pu Lei a/k/a Yang Pulei (Yeung), with fraud for lying to clients and prospective clients regarding the safety of their investments, the investment adviser&rsquo;s relationships with certain well-known banks and law firms, and the holding company&rsquo;s initial public stock offering.</p>
<p>The SEC complaint alleges that QZ Asset, QZ Global, and Yeung defrauded hundreds of individuals out of at least $6 million. According to the complaint, QZ Asset and Yeung falsely claimed that QZ Asset would use its proprietary AI-based technology to help generate extraordinary weekly returns while promising &ldquo;100%&rdquo; protection for client funds and that well-known and reputable financial and legal firms were providing services to the company. The complaint also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed that QZ Global had applied to have its common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and that they had positive communications with SEC staff regarding this effort. In addition, QZ Global allegedly touted its SEC filings, which were materially deficient, to lure clients and prospective clients into handing over their funds to QZ Asset. According to the complaint, after engaging in this global, multi-million-dollar fraud, the defendants allegedly stopped communicating with clients and QZ Asset&rsquo;s website, which clients used to access their funds, was taken down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The defendants&rsquo; brazen fraud alleged in our complaint, including their abuse of the SEC&rsquo;s filing process to prey on individuals in the United States and across the world, is reprehensible,&rdquo; said Jason J. Burt, Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Denver Regional Office. &ldquo;We will continue to hold accountable those who deceive investors, including by misusing the SEC&rsquo;s name and processes to provide an air of legitimacy to their fraudulent endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Yamini Piplani Grema, with assistance from Jodanna Haskins and Helena Engelhart Bean of the Denver Regional Office and additional assistance from the SEC&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs. It is being supervised by Danielle R. Voorhees, Nicholas P. Heinke, and Mr. Burt. The litigation will be led by Ms. Haskins and will be supervised by Gregory A. Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p>

<div> Keywords: Austal USA, SEC charges, fraudulent revenue recognition, civil penalty, accounting fraud<br />
Summary: Austal USA and its parent company settled SEC charges for conducting a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme, agreeing to pay a $24 million civil penalty. The scheme involved artificially reducing estimated shipbuilding costs to meet revenue budget and projections, leading to premature revenue recognition. Individuals involved were charged with accounting fraud in a parallel matter announced by the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Austal USA, LLC, a Mobile, Alabama-based shipbuilder, and its Australia-based parent company, Austal Limited, have agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges that the companies conducted a fraudulent revenue recognition scheme. As part of the settlement with the SEC, Austal USA will pay a $24 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from at least January 2013 through July 2016, the Austal companies engaged in a scheme to artificially reduce by tens of millions of dollars the estimated cost to complete certain shipbuilding projects for the U.S. Navy. The complaint alleges that Austal USA knew that its shipbuilding costs were rising and higher than planned, but arbitrarily lowered the cost estimates to meet Austal USA&rsquo;s revenue budget and projections. The complaint further alleges that based on this fraudulent manipulation of the cost estimates, Austal Limited prematurely recognized revenue and, as a result, met or exceeded analyst consensus estimates for earnings before interest and tax, known as EBIT, a key financial metric for the company.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that Austal Limited and Austal USA acted knowingly or with severe recklessness in connection with the scheme that was allegedly carried out by Austal USA&rsquo;s former president, Craig D. Perciavalle, former director of financial analysis, Joseph A. Runkel, and former director of the Littoral Combat Ships program, William O. Adams, all of whom the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-69">SEC charged</a>&nbsp;with accounting fraud in March 2023. That litigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transparency is a hallmark of financial reporting, and investors rely on companies to accurately and fairly represent their financial condition so that they can make informed decisions,&rdquo; said Jason Burt, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Denver Regional Office. &ldquo;The terms of this settlement make it clear that when companies manipulate their financial results to avoid falling short of analyst expectations &ndash; and those actions harm U.S. investors &ndash; the SEC will hold those companies accountable, wherever they are located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, charges Austal Limited and Austal USA with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Austal Limited and Austal USA each consented to permanent injunctions, and Austal USA agreed to pay the aforementioned penalty. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC plans to seek the creation of a Fair Fund for distribution of the penalty to harmed investors.</p>
<p>In a parallel matter, the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, announced settled charges against Austal USA.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Kimberly Steckling, Kenneth Stalzer, and Donna Walker and supervised by Ian Karpel, Nicholas Heinke, and Mr. Burt of the Denver Regional Office. The ongoing litigation against the individuals is being led by Sharan Lieberman and Christopher Martin and supervised by Gregory Kasper, Mr. Heinke, and Mr. Burt.</p>

<title>New York Department Of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris Secures $35 Million Settlement With Nordea For Significant Compliance Failures And Inadequate Diligence Over High-Risk Correspondent Banks - Settlement Follows Department’s Investigation Into Bank’s Role Outlined In The Panama Papers Leak</title>

<div> penalties, Nordea Bank, compliance failures, Bank Secrecy Act, due diligence<br />
Summary: 
Nordea Bank has agreed to pay $35 million in penalties for significant compliance failures, including inadequate AML safeguards and failure to conduct proper due diligence. It was implicated in the flow of illicit funds and failed to implement compliance initiatives. Additionally, the Bank's transaction monitoring system was inadequate, and it formed relationships with high-risk banking partners, exposing it to additional money laundering risks. These deficiencies created a high risk of criminal abuse in Nordea's financial channels. Moreover, it imported those risks to the New York financial system. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>New York Department of Financial Services (&ldquo;DFS&rdquo;) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris announced today that Nordea Bank Abp (&ldquo;Nordea&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Bank&rdquo;) has agreed to pay $35 million in penalties as part of a Consent Order entered into with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &ldquo;Department&rdquo;) for significant compliance failures with respect to Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (&ldquo;BSA/AML&rdquo;) requirements and the Bank&rsquo;s failure to conduct proper due diligence of its correspondent bank partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;International financial entities such as Nordea must safeguard against criminal activity in the global financial system, and for years Nordea failed in these respects,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Superintendent Harris.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is critical that such institutions maintain robust compliance programs and conduct proper due diligence of their customers and banking partners.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, the Panama Papers leak exposed Nordea&rsquo;s role in helping hundreds of its customers create tax-sheltered companies using offshore accounts. The activity at Nordea&rsquo;s former branch in Vesterport, Denmark further implicated the Bank in the flow of illicit funds with entities connected to the Russian Laundromat, the Azerbaijani Laundromat, and the Hermitage Capital Allegations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department&rsquo;s subsequent investigation revealed that the Bank&rsquo;s AML safeguards at its high-risk, former Baltic Branches, failed to adequately compensate for the increased risk level, leaving the Bank vulnerable to money laundering and the flow of suspicious transactions. Moreover, Nordea consistently failed to properly implement compliance initiatives, exposing the Bank to elevated financial crime risk. Compounding these weaknesses, the Bank formed relationships with high-risk banking partners, further exposing it to additional money laundering risks and making it possible for the Bank to facilitate financial crimes. The Department&rsquo;s investigation additionally found that the Bank&rsquo;s transaction monitoring system was inadequate, leading Nordea itself to acknowledge that its overall AML risk was &ldquo;critical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The combination of deficient AML controls, an unsophisticated transaction monitoring apparatus, and a decentralized global compliance program created a set of circumstances that exposed Nordea&rsquo;s financial channels to a high risk of criminal abuse. Nordea&rsquo;s relationships with U.S. banks imported those risks to the New York financial system.</p>

<p><span>​The European Banking Authority (EBA) updated today the 13 systemic importance indicators and underlying data for the 33 largest institutions in the EU whose leverage ratio exposure measure exceeds EUR 200 bn. This publication includes updated numbers and data items specific to the recognition of the Banking Union and of institutions that are part of the Single Resolution Mechanism. Acting as a central data hub in the disclosure process, the EBA updates this data on a yearly basis and provides user-friendly tools to aggregate it across the EU.</span></p>
<p>​This end-2023 data will assist competent authorities to identify a subset of banks as global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), following the final decision by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).&nbsp;</p>
<p>​A stable sample of 27 institutions shows that the sum for those banks&rsquo; total exposures increased by 1.3% at the end of 2023. The indicators for Securities Outstanding and Level 3 Assets increased by 14.9% and 12.6% respectively, both achieving the highest aggregate value since 2013. Assets under custody also observed a noticeable increase by 11.2%. The indicator for payments activity was the only one showing a decreasing trend (-3.7%) from 2022 to the end of 2023.&nbsp; ​</p>
<h4>Background legal basis&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The identification of a G-SII, which leads to higher capital buffer requirements, falls under the responsibility of national competent authorities. The identification is based on the disclosure of global denominators and G-SIB exercise results, which are expected to be published by the BCBS and the FSB in November each year. Any higher capital buffer requirements will then apply after about one year from the publication by competent authorities of bank-specific results and buffer rate allocation, thus allowing institutions enough time to adjust to the new buffer requirement.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2020/Guidelines%20on%20the%20specification%20and%20disclosure%20of%20systemic%20importance%20indicators/935707/Final%20report%20-%20EBA%20GLs%20on%20disclosure%20of%20G-SIIs%20indicators.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EBA Guidelines on disclosure of G-SIIs</a>, as amended by EBA/GL/2022/11, define uniform requirements for disclosing the values used during the identification and scoring process of G-SIIs, in line with the internationally agreed standards developed by the BCBS and the FSB. Having in mind the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220531.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">G-SIB assessment methodology review announced by the Basel Committee</a>&nbsp;on the 31st of May 2022, the EBA supports the disclosure by EU authorities of the cross-jurisdictional indicators and underlying data items needed to calculate the parallel set of scores specific to European Banking Union banks.</p>
<p>To promote a level playing field in the EU and to increase transparency in the internal financial market, the current level of disclosure goes beyond the minimum standards required by the BCBS, both in terms of granularity of the disclosed information and applicable scope of institutions. Consequently, some of the group-specific templates currently published belong to institutions that have not contributed directly to the BCBS's G-SIB exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2021/539/oj" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the specification of the methodology for the identification and definition of subcategories of G-SIIs</a>, and Guidelines on disclosure of G-SIIs have been developed in accordance with Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD IV) on the basis of internationally agreed standards, such as the framework established by the BCBS and the FSB.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ), in partnership with CF Benchmarks, today announced its filing with the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>&nbsp;to list and trade Nasdaq Bitcoin Index Options (XBTX). Upon regulatory approval, investors will be able to manage positions and hedge investments in cryptocurrency through options, furthering the maturity and liquidity of the asset class.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We are proud to partner with CF Benchmarks for the Nasdaq Bitcoin Index Options, providing market participants with trusted investment avenues for accessing the digital asset ecosystem,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Greg Ferrari</span>, Vice President and Head of Exchange Business Management at Nasdaq. &ldquo;This collaboration further combines the innovative crypto landscape with the resiliency and reliability of traditional securities markets and would mark a significant milestone for expanding the maturation of the digital assets market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pending regulatory approval, the index options will track the price of Bitcoin as represented by the CME CF Bitcoin Real-Time Index (BRTI). The product is intended to provide institutional and retail market participants access to an important risk management tool. The calculations powering the index are executed every second of every day by aggregating Bitcoin-USD order data from the leading cryptocurrency exchanges meeting the specific criteria.</p>
<p>XBTX will include European-style exercise and cash settlement provisions, with the final settlement value determined by the price of the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate - New York Variant (BRRNY) upon expiration, divided by a factor of one hundred (100). The BRRNY provides one set&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;dollar price through a combination of data collected&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">between 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm</span>, providing a clear reference rate and essentially acting as a closing price in a market that is hallmarked by continuous global trading.</p>
<p>"CF Benchmarks is delighted to partner with Nasdaq on the launch of options settling to the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate &ndash; New York Variant (BRRNY), the most liquid and widely recognised BTC price benchmark for the US market,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Sui Chung</span>, CEO of CF Benchmarks. &ldquo;Spot options settling to BRRNY will build upon the hugely successful BTC futures and options contracts offered by CME. Together these regulated crypto derivatives will give investors the confidence to deploy more nuanced ways to gain exposure to the largest digital asset and will complement the spot ETFs that have already proved so popular with investors. As the cornerstone provider of regulated benchmarks for the asset class we are proud to bring more institutions to the market that will keep improving market liquidity."</p>
<p><span>Nasdaq supports the maturation of digital asset ecosystem with trusted technology and institutional adoption</span></p>
<p>Amidst the maturation of the digital asset ecosystem, prioritizing trust, transparency and investor protection is paramount. To further those aims Nasdaq also supports its clients in the digital asset ecosystem through a variety of solutions and offerings.</p>
<p>The first is through serving as a leading technology provider of Central Counterparties (CCPs) and Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), which are pivotal in shaping governance frameworks and market stability essential for attracting institutional investors and fostering standardization. Through its versatile, multi-asset solutions, Nasdaq empowers organizations with dependable and adaptable technology throughout the trade process, enabling them to enhance operational efficiency, promote transparency and boost liquidity while maintaining exceptional levels of resilience.</p>
<p>The second is through Exchange Traded Product (ETP) listings, working closely with asset managers and regulators to ensure successful launch and trading of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs. Nasdaq&rsquo;s supports these digital assets products through market quality and liquidity programs that provide our clients with tight spreads and robust price discovery.</p>

<div> futures, Bitcoin, CME Group, BFF, cryptocurrency
Summary:<br /><br />CME Group introduces Bitcoin Friday futures (BFF) with smaller contract sizes, cash-settled to BRRNY, allowing investors to fine-tune exposure and track spot price efficiently. Interactive Brokers and Plus500 support the launch.<br />Webull sees these futures as a great complement to their existing suite of CME Group products, offering a cost-efficient way for global traders to gain exposure to Bitcoin and manage their portfolios. The Bitcoin Friday futures will join CME Group's suite of benchmark Bitcoin futures contracts, as trading highlights show strong volumes and open interest for Bitcoin and Micro Bitcoin futures. <div>
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced it will further expand its&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;derivatives offerings with the introduction of&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures (BFF) on&nbsp;September 30, pending regulatory review.</p>
<p>Sized at one-fiftieth of one&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>, these new weekly futures contracts will be cash-settled to the CME CF&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Reference Rate New York Variant (BRRNY) at&nbsp;4:00 p.m.&nbsp;New York&nbsp;time every Friday. A new BFF contract will be listed every Thursday at&nbsp;6:00 p.m.&nbsp;New York&nbsp;time for a Friday trade date, with market participants able to trade the nearest two Fridays at any given point. A Friday expiry allows these contracts to closely track the spot price of&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>, as well as help investors mitigate weekend price moves.</p>
<p>"With these weekly expiring smaller-sized contracts, investors of all sizes - from institutions to sophisticated, active retail traders - will be able to more accurately fine-tune their&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;exposure on a regulated exchange," said&nbsp;
Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group Global Head of&nbsp;<span>Cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;Products. "By settling to the BRRNY, the benchmark used by leading spot&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs, traders will also benefit from growing liquidity and the ability to more efficiently capture market moves during&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;hours."</p>
<p>"We are pleased to support CME Group's launch of these new weekly expiring&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;futures contracts and further expand the low-cost products available to our clients," said&nbsp;
Steve Sanders, EVP of Marketing and Product Development at Interactive Brokers. "With a shorter duration and smaller-sized contract,&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures will offer our active trader and institutional investor clients a flexible and cost-effective new way to manage their&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;exposure in a transparent market."</p>
<p>"The new&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures (BFF) contract is another great example of CME Group's continued innovation in the retail&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;trading space," said&nbsp;
Elad Even-Chen, Group CFO of Plus500. "We are keen to support the launch of this shorter duration contract, which will suit the needs of a broad category of investors looking to manage their&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;portfolios with more flexibility and capital efficiency. The BFF contract will appeal to an international audience and the launch very much aligns with Plus500's approach to product innovation and responding to customer feedback."</p>
<p>"<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures will serve as a great trading complement to the existing suite of CME Group products we offer at Webull," said&nbsp;
Tanmay Sheth, Director of Futures at Webull. "With its smaller notional size and weekly Friday expiry,&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures will allow our global traders a cost-efficient way to gain exposure to&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>, as well as effectively manage their existing product portfolios and capture new trading strategies."</p>
<p><span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Friday futures will join&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;deeply liquid suite of benchmark&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;futures contracts. Year-to-date trading highlights include:</p>

ICE and Space Intelligence collaborate on ICE CoT platform for cocoa and coffee trade compliance with EU Deforestation Regulation, using geospatial mapping data. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) is collaborating with Space Intelligence, a provider of high accuracy nature mapping data, to launch the ICE Commodity Traceability Service (ICE CoT).</p>
<p>ICE CoT is a technology platform designed to facilitate the continued frictionless trade of physical cocoa and coffee by automating the process of submitting, storing, validating and sharing due diligence information mandated by the European Union&rsquo;s Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). The EUDR is designed to reduce the EU&rsquo;s impact on global deforestation and forest degradation by requiring proof that specified goods entering or sold in the EU are &ldquo;deforestation-free&rdquo; and lawfully produced. Europe is the largest market for cocoa and coffee worldwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to be working with Space Intelligence on the continued build-out of ICE CoT,&rdquo; said Clive de Ruig, President of IBA. &ldquo;As one of the world&rsquo;s foremost experts in forest mapping using satellite data, their expertise in delivering highly accurate and comprehensive data will be critical to providing information on whether cocoa and coffee farm plots are deforestation-free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Space Intelligence&rsquo;s geospatial mapping capabilities will be integrated into ICE CoT, clearly indicating areas in cocoa and coffee producing countries that have been deforested post-December 31, 2020, and that are not eligible for the production of EUDR-compliant goods. This geospatial mapping data will work in tandem with ICE CoT&rsquo;s farm and physical flow validation methodologies, utilizing farm geolocation and traceability information throughout the supply chain to support the tradability of commodities within the EU,&rdquo; continued de Ruig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The EUDR means stakeholders across commodity markets need to be provided with trust in the compliance of the supply of goods entering the EU, which can be ensured by audit-grade mapping data supporting the verification process,&rdquo; said Professor Ed Mitchard, Co-founder and Chief Scientist at Space Intelligence. &ldquo;Our process generates mapping data that meets the stringent requirements of the EUDR, developed from decades of experience in remote sensing research and integrating ecology expertise with machine learning to achieve accuracy on a geographical scale. Our collaboration with IBA is a testament to our shared goal of ensuring customers can meet the requirements of the EUDR.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In June 2024, ICE CoT commenced a pilot phase for validating cocoa and coffee farm geolocation data using a methodology developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2023/ICE-to-Collaborate-with-Meridia-to-launch-the-ICE-Commodity-Traceability-Service-to-Support-Commercial-Trade-Affected-by-the-EU-Deforestation-Regulation/default.aspx" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Meridia</a>&nbsp;. The platform allows companies to upload farm plot coordinates and run a series of validation checks on the geolocation data. IBA expects to pilot the validation of physical flow data related to the movement, including merging or splitting, of cocoa and coffee parcels along the supply chain to its ultimate use or export, along with lawful production data, in the coming months.</p>
<p>ICE provides the largest markets in the world to trade cocoa and coffee through its benchmark Cocoa, London Cocoa, Coffee C&reg; and Robusta Coffee futures and options markets. Last year the equivalent of over 500 million tons traded on ICE&rsquo;s cocoa and coffee markets.</p>
<p>IBA plans to launch ICE CoT prior to the end of 2024. The platform remains subject to further testing, system and data availability, and any regulatory contingencies.

<p>Laura Dawes, director of authorisations at the FCA, said: 'We welcome the Tribunal's ruling.

<title>Nasdaq Launches The Nasdaq Stockholm IPO Pulse: Tripled IPO Activity Since Recent Low</title>

<div> Nasdaq, Stockholm, IPO, Sweden, indicator
Summary:<br /><br />Nasdaq launches Stockholm IPO Pulse, leading indicator for Swedish IPO activity. Shows 2024 upturn, blends fundamental drivers, and incorporates broader European data. <div>
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announces the launch of the Nasdaq Stockholm IPO Pulse, a new leading indicator of IPO activity in Sweden. This new indicator blends six fundamental drivers into an index that reliably leads the turns in the Swedish IPO cycle quarterly.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Stockholm IPO Pulse shows a 2024 upturn in IPO activity, which has already tripled from its recent low in September 2022. Looking forward the forecast shows a continued increase over the next several months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasdaq Stockholm is a leading European marketplace with the deepest capital markets on the continent, driven by the country's robust investment culture. The introduction of the Nasdaq Stockholm IPO Pulse serves as a significant indicator for the direction in which the rest of Europe is heading.&rdquo; said Adam Kosty&aacute;l, President of Nasdaq Stockholm.</p>
<p>The Sweden IPO Pulse mirrors the methodology of Nasdaq&rsquo;s US-focused IPO Pulse, testing more than 50 series and finding six leading indicators that theoretically and empirically lead shifts in IPO activity over the last three decades, with few false alarms or missed turns. One key difference between the US and Sweden IPO Pulses is that the US version uses&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;US data, while the Swedish version incorporates some broader European data. This is because, given the interlinkages between Sweden and the rest of Europe, broader European data is relevant to Sweden&rsquo;s IPO activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We launched the Nasdaq IPO Pulse tracking US markets in the beginning of this year to empower corporates and investors with a data-driven forecast of how receptive the markets may be to new issuances in the near-term. We are very happy to now expand our index with the Nasdaq Stockholm&rsquo;s IPO Pulse index forecasting the near-term development of the Swedish IPO market which is pointing upwards for the coming months&rdquo; said Phil Mackintosh, Chief Economist, Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The data included in the index captures a broad range of factors that contribute to the decision to IPO:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Market Volatility</strong>: S30 1-Month Realized Volatility (6-Month Trailing Average)</li>
<li><strong>Recent Returns</strong>: Stoxx 600 Price Annual Growth</li>
<li><strong>Valuations</strong>: &nbsp;Stoxx 600 Enterprise Value to Sales Ratio Annual Growth</li>
<li><strong>Macroeconomic Growth:&nbsp;</strong>Swedish Manufacturing PMI</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Sentiment</strong>: Swedish Consumers&rsquo; General Economic Situation Over the Next 12 Months</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq&rsquo;s Proprietary IPO Data</strong></li>
</ol>

This offering provides the platform's sophisticated, active traders with a speculative product that enables them to profit from rising or falling share prices with limited risk.</p>

<p>As the options are exchange traded, there is limited counterparty risk and less chance of a single market maker skewing the price adversely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We are pleased to offer options trading for our users, fulfilling the high demand we've received for the offering since our initial launch," said Nick Saunders, CEO of Webull UK. "Few brokers in the UK offer retail clients access to listed derivatives. Our clients value the fact they can speculate without betting against their broker and use options to try to make money in rising or falling markets."</p>
<p>This new offering follows the recent launch of Webull Savings, which provides UK users with access to a marketplace of savings accounts and the ability to move funds quickly between trading accounts and banks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Euronext, Nord Pool, Power Futures, Nordic, Baltic
Summary:
Euronext and Nord Pool are launching a new power derivatives market in the Nordic and Baltic regions to provide sustainable trading options. <div>
<p>Euronext today announced that Nord Pool, the European power market, is to enter a new area of business with the launch, together with Euronext, of a dedicated Nordic and Baltic power derivatives market.</p>
<p>The new Euronext Nord Pool Power Futures market will be traded on Euronext&rsquo;s pan-European Optiq&reg; trading platform and cleared by Euronext Clearing. The announcement comes after extensive consultation with market participants. Euronext Nord Pool Power Futures will be designed to answer the need expressed by the market to have a long-standing, sustainable market infrastructure committed to developing secure power futures trading in the Nordic and Baltic regions, with a strong Nordic foundation. Client testing will open as soon as March 2025.</p>
<p>Euronext Nord Pool Power Futures will offer trading of cash-settled futures for all maturities on System Price and EPADs across the Nordics and Baltics. Underlying spot indices will be provided by Nord Pool.</p>
<p>Camille Beudin, Head of Diversified Services at Euronext, and Chairman of the Board of Directors at Nord Pool, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The launch of Euronext Nord Pool Power Futures presents a unique opportunity to combine the skills and expertise of Euronext across energy markets with a firm Nordic base, harnessing industry knowledge, trading and clearing of financial products, in order to deliver an attractive and competitive offering for customers.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Tom Darell, CEO at Nord Pool, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Nord Pool and Euronext are absolutely committed to deliver a long-standing and liquid power derivatives market for the Nordic and Baltic regions. The Nordic and Baltic power market is showing a recovery since the energy crisis, but action is needed to cement and accelerate that recovery. Nord Pool and Euronext will work to bring back liquidity to Nordic power derivatives, with a proven set up which will attract OTC traded volumes into the market. We have consulted extensively with key businesses in the Nordic and Baltic power sector, businesses which represent more than 70% of market volumes. Their message has been clear: end uncertainty in the power derivatives territory by delivering a liquid power futures market, run by a business with commitment and a vision for the future.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Collaboration Between SIX And Diebold Nixdorf</title>

<div> cooperation, cash supply, Switzerland, ATM operations, efficient

Summary:<br />Cooperation between SIX and Diebold Nixdorf to optimize cash supply in Switzerland, focusing on ATM pooling and efficient cash management. <div>
<p><span>SIX and Diebold Nixdorf are entering into a cooperation to secure the long-term cash supply in Switzerland through innovative approaches.</span></p>
<p>The digitalization of payments is progressing rapidly, and cash and cash supply are adapting to market changes. In Switzerland, cash continues to be highly valued by large segments of the population. The decline in the number of bank and post office branches and ATMs is having an impact on the availability of cash. Between 2015 and 2023, the number of bank branches fell from 3,100 to 2,600 and the number of post office branches from 1,500 to 800, while the number of ATMs fell from 7,200 at the beginning of 2020 to less than 6,400 today. In the current situation, there is a risk that the cost of providing cash will rise, putting further pressure on banks as ATM operators and driving up the cost of providing the ATM infrastructure.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a sustainable, efficient and broad-based cash supply in Switzerland in the long term, new cooperation models are required. Against this backdrop, SIX and Diebold Nixdorf have decided to combine their expertise in cash supply and ATM operations. By combining expertise, technology and a broad partner network, the two companies are developing an innovative approach to market challenges and, together with innovative partners such as Helveticor Ltd, are evaluating how to make cash logistics more sustainable and efficient.</p>
<p><span>Goals of the Collaboration</span></p>
<p>By working together, SIX and Diebold Nixdorf are covering the entire cash supply value chain to ensure continuous optimization of ATM operations in Switzerland. For ATM users, this means the usual secure and reliable cash transactions, while banks benefit from leaner processes. The aim is to achieve efficient cash management by offering all relevant operating and management services from a sole source. From site selection, preparation and commissioning to ensuring high availability and smooth transaction processing, the cooperation offers high-quality services through the use of state-of-the-art technology, software and services.</p>
<p><span>Our Vision for Cash Supply in Switzerland</span></p>
<p>SIX and Diebold Nixdorf believe that ATM pooling is an indispensable contribution to an efficient, nationwide and reliable cash supply in Switzerland. With ATM pooling, the Swiss banks that operate ATMs will integrate them into a separately operated network. In particular, such a network would have the task of optimizing the operation of ATMs in terms of geographical coverage, operations and cash logistics in such a way that the Swiss banks can continue to guarantee their customers and ATM users comprehensive access to cash. ATM users will also benefit from state-of-the-art ATM technology and an expanded network.</p>
<p>The requirements for the implementation of ATM pooling will be discussed at an event in September with the Swiss banks as ATM operators.</p>

<div> Recognition, Data Protection, DIFC, Global Forum Assembly, Privacy

DIFC recognized by Global Forum Assembly as Associate Member, advancing position on data protection and governance, joining Global CBPR Forum for regulatory cooperation.

Summary:<br /><br />DIFC recognized as Associate Member by Global Forum Assembly, advancing data protection and governance and joining Global CBPR Forum for regulatory cooperation. <div>
<ul>
<li>DIFC first in the region to advance position on data protection, regulations, and governance within the Global Forum Assembly (GFA)</li>
<li>In 2022, DIFC Commissioner recognised Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) as an adequate mechanism for free flow of data with trust</li>
<li>As an Associate in the Global CBPR Forum (the Forum), DIFC and the GFA leadership look to further opportunities for regulatory cooperation</li>
<li>GFA&rsquo;s recognition reinforces DIFC&rsquo;s regionally pioneering position on data protection, regulations, and governance</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, has been recognised by the GFA as an Associate Member.</span></p>
<p><span>The Global CBPR Forum welcomed DIFC, Mauritius and Bermuda as Associates, following the Global Forum Assembly&rsquo;s endorsement of the Membership Committee&rsquo;s Recommendation that all three have met the conditions for recognition as an Associate. The full announcement can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/The-Forum-Welcomes-Mauritius-the-Dubai-International-Financial-Centre-and-Bermuda-as-Associates/">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>The recognition is the result of DIFC&rsquo;s active and substantive participation in the development of the Forum since its&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.commerce.gov/global-cross-border-privacy-rules-declaration"><span>establishment in April 2022</span></a></span><span>, most recently attending workshops hosted by the Personal Information Protection Commission (PPC) in Tokyo, Japan.&nbsp; As a long-time supporter of alternative, trustworthy data transfer mechanisms, DIFC&rsquo;s status in the Forum will provide an opportunity to collaborate with other regulatory authorities on the future of secure, international data flows. The CBPRs are a flexible yet robust privacy certification scheme that the Commissioner will adopt in accordance with Article 50(5) of the Data Protection Law, DIFC Law No 5 of 2020 for implementation into the DIFC data protection compliance regime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Chief Legal Officer of DIFC Authority and DIFC Data Protection Commissioner, Jacques Visser,</span><span>&nbsp;thanked the GFA leadership, stating, &ldquo;We are honoured to be recognised by the GFA, especially as DIFC is the first and only jurisdiction in the Middle East to obtain Associate status in the Forum in addition to its acceptance into the Forum&rsquo;s Global Cooperation Arrangement for Privacy Enforcement (CAPE) in April 2024. This milestone echoes our commitment to uphold the highest standards of privacy and data protection in DIFC. We look forward to collaborating with our international partners on this important initiative. As a jurisdiction serving multi-jurisdictional constituents, ensuring the free flow of data whilst ensuring that importers treat it ethically and with care is of vital importance to us.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span>DIFC&rsquo;s recognition in the above regard also comes in addition to the United Kingdom previously selecting DIFC as one of six global jurisdictions to be a priority partner for creating a &ldquo;Data Bridge&rdquo; with for similar purposes. The assessment by the UK&rsquo;s Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) towards this outcome is currently ongoing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DIFC&rsquo;s efforts in the above regard is underlined by the importance of International Data Transfers in facilitating modern-day business transactions. Trustworthy data flows help streamline supply chain management and allow for financial inclusion so that businesses, particularly those in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region with ties to the UK, can scale and trade globally. There are as many as 5,000 British companies operating in the UAE, many of which depend on safe data transfers that comply with applicable data protection laws and associated policies.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SEC Charges Brothers Jonathan And Tanner Adam With $60 Million Ponzi Scheme - SEC Obtains Emergency Relief To Freeze Defendants’ Assets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> emergency, asset freezes, Ponzi scheme, crypto investment, SEC
Summary:
SEC obtained emergency asset freezes against the Adam brothers and their entities for an alleged $60 million Ponzi scheme involving false promises of high crypto investment returns. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained emergency asset freezes against Jonathan Adam, a resident of Angleton, Texas, and his brother, Tanner Adam, a resident of Miami, Florida, and against their respective entities, GCZ Global LLC and Triten Financial Group LLC, to halt an alleged $60 million Ponzi scheme impacting more than 80 investors across the country.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that, from January 2023 to June 2024, the Adam brothers solicited and lured victims with the promise of up to 13.5 percent monthly investment returns. According to the complaint, the duo falsely told investors that Jonathan Adam had created a &ldquo;bot&rdquo; that operated on a crypto asset trading platform to identify arbitrage trading opportunities, and that investor funds would be used in a lending pool that would, through smart contracts, fund &ldquo;flash loans&rdquo; to complete these arbitrage trades. The Adam brothers allegedly told investors that, short of a global market meltdown, investor funds were safe. The SEC alleges that, in reality, the lending pool as described to investors did not exist, and the defendants instead used millions of dollars of investor funds to pay supposed returns to existing investors and to support their lavish lifestyles. For example, the complaint alleges that Tanner Adam used investor funds to make the down and installment payments to build a $30 million condominium in Miami and Jonathan Adam used at least $480,000 of investor funds to purchase cars, trucks, and recreational vehicles. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleges that Jonathan Adam misrepresented his background in order to gain the trust of investors and failed to tell investors that he had previously been convicted of three counts of securities fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we allege, the Adam brothers promised their investors high returns on a crypto investment that did not exist, and then used investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments and to purchase designer goods, recreational vehicles, and million-dollar homes,&rdquo; said Justin C. Jeffries, Associate Director of Enforcement in the SEC&rsquo;s Atlanta Regional Office. &ldquo;The SEC will use all tools at its disposal to stop those who exploit the excitement around new technologies to defraud investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC's complaint, filed on August 26, 2024 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Jonathan Adam, Tanner Adam, GCZ Global, LLC, and Triten Financial Group LLC with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to the emergency relief granted by the Court, which the defendants did not oppose, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Melissa J. Mitchell and Krysta M. Cannon of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Matthew F. McNamara and Mr. Jeffries. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Kristin W. Murnahan and supervised by M. Graham Loomis.</p>

<div> charges, Bank of New York Mellon, swap transactions, supervision failures, civil monetary penalty
Summary:
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission settled charges with Bank of New York Mellon for misreporting swap transactions, supervision failures, and imposed a $5 million penalty. BNYM will retain an independent compliance consultant. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges with&nbsp;<strong>The Bank of New York Mellon</strong>&nbsp;(BNYM) for repeatedly failing to correctly report millions of swap transactions to a registered swap data repository, in violation of a prior CFTC order against BNYM, and for failing to properly supervise its swap dealer business as required by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8033-19">8033-19</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8042-19">8042-19</a>] The order imposes a $5 million civil monetary penalty and incorporates BNYM&rsquo;s decision to retain an independent compliance consultant to review and provide advice regarding its compliance program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accurate reporting is a core pillar of the regulatory regime for swaps, and every individual data field matters,&rdquo; said Division of Enforcement Director Ian McGinley. &ldquo;It is essential that swap dealers get this right. In that vein, I commend BNYM for its extensive cooperation, remediation, and decision to retain an independent compliance consultant to assist the bank in improving its compliance program and preventing the reoccurrence of misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Case Background</strong></p>
<p>The order finds from approximately 2018 through 2023, BNYM repeatedly failed to correctly report at least five million swap transactions and failed to properly supervise its swap dealer business with respect to swap data reporting and monitoring of its associated persons (AP). Many of the reporting failures also constituted a violation of the CFTC&rsquo;s September 30, 2019 order against BNYM. In re Bank of New York Mellon, CFTC No. 19-42, 2019 WL 4915489 (Sep. 30, 2019) (consent order) (the 2019 Order). The 2019 order required BNYM to cease and desist from further violating some of the same sections of the CEA and CFTC regulations that are the subject of the current action.</p>
<p>In addition to the supervision failures reflected in BNYM&rsquo;s swap data reporting violations, BNYM also failed to properly supervise its business as a swap dealer in that it had no written policies or procedures to monitor the voice communications of its APs or monitor the e-communications of its APs communicating in languages other than English, in order to ensure its APs were complying with the CEA and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>The reduced civil monetary penalty in the order recognizes BNYM&rsquo;s self-reporting; acknowledges BNYM&rsquo;s representations concerning its remediation efforts, including engagement of an outside compliance consultant; and recognizes substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Daniel Jordan and Rick Glaser as well as former staff members Amanda Burks and Phillip Tumminio.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Sound Point Capital Management For Insider Trading Policy Failures - Fund Adviser’s Policies Failed To Consider Potential Impact Of Material Nonpublic Information Gained From Role As Company Lenders</title>

<div> penalty, SEC, Sound Point, CLOs, MNPI
Summary: 
Sound Point Capital Management LP was fined $1.8 million by the SEC for failing to establish, maintain, and enforce policies regarding the misuse of MNPI in CLO trading. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based registered investment adviser Sound Point Capital Management LP for failing to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information (MNPI) concerning its trading of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Sound Point agreed to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, as a significant component of its business, Sound Point managed CLOs and traded its own CLOs as well as CLOs managed by third parties. Sound Point also had a credit business for which it often participated in lender groups or creditors&rsquo; committees. As a result of this business, on occasion, Sound Point came into possession of MNPI about companies whose loans were held in the CLOs that Sound Point traded.&nbsp;After an incident in July 2019, Sound Point began conducting pre-trade compliance reviews of the potential impact of MNPI about loans in Sound Point-managed CLOs, though it did not adopt a written policy for these reviews until July 2022. Sound Point did not establish, maintain, or enforce any written policies or procedures concerning the potential impact of MNPI about the loans in third party-managed CLOs until June 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fund managers &ndash; including those with multiple business lines or strategies &ndash; must consider how they may come into possession of material nonpublic information and then adopt and implement reasonable policies and procedures around those risks,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;Among other things, advisers must evaluate how their roles as lenders could expose them to MNPI that may relate to their CLO trading positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Sound Point violated Sections 204A and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. In addition to the $1.8 million penalty, Sound Point agreed to a cease-and-desist order and censure.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Craig Welter, Heather L. Shaffer, and Brian Fitzpatrick under the supervision of Lee A. Greenwood, Mr. Dean, and Corey Schuster, all of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. Matthew Christiansen, Stephen Latin, and Jennifer Duggins of the Division of Examinations&rsquo; Private Funds Unit and Andrew Green of the Philadelphia Regional Office assisted with the investigation.</p>

<div> CTA, Wisconsin, commodity futures, unregistered, penalty
Summary:
The CFTC fined Mark Hendershott $75,000 for acting as an unregistered commodity trading advisor in Wisconsin, providing hedging advice and trading on behalf of clients. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it entered an order requiring <strong>Mark Hendershott</strong>, located in Wisconsin, to pay a $75,000 civil monetary penalty for acting as an unregistered commodity trading advisor (CTA).</p>
<p>The order finds, from in or about May 2018 through at least June 2021, Hendershott violated Section 4m(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. &sect; 6m(1), by making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with his business as a CTA without being registered with the CFTC as required.</p>
<p>According to the order, Hendershott was self-employed as a consultant to farmers. While the majority of his consulting services generally related to activities associated with physical crop-related activities, he also provided his clients hedging advice relating to their crop production using commodity futures. Hendershott provided tailored advice to clients concerning their hedging requirements and counseled clients as to the advisability of using futures contracts to hedge their crop production, including wheat, soybeans, oats, corn, and lean hogs futures. Hendershott developed his client base by contacting prospective clients, including individuals in the farming community, and he provided this advice in exchange for a flat fee that he charged to his clients.</p>
<p>The order finds in order to facilitate Hendershott&rsquo;s furnishing of advice with respect to the hedging of his clients&rsquo; crop production, Hendershott arranged to have his clients open accounts with a CFTC-registered futures commission merchant, and he assisted in the account opening process for each of the clients he introduced. In addition, according to the order, he traded on behalf of many of his clients, placing orders in their accounts for futures contracts such as wheat, soybeans, oats, corn, and lean hogs futures. He also engaged in other services for clients, including arranging for transfers to and from his clients&rsquo; trading accounts from his clients&rsquo; bank accounts and dealing with margin and credit issues within the trading accounts. Hendershott did not have a power of attorney or other agreement authorizing him to cause transactions to be effected with respect to any of the commodity interest accounts on behalf of which he traded.</p>
<p>The order finds Hendershott was required to register as a CTA because during the relevant period, he held himself out generally to clients and potential clients as a CTA and during the course of the preceding 12 months, he furnished commodity trading advice to more than 15 persons, and he used email, the telephone, and the Internet in connection with his business as a CTA.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Patrick Daly, Diana Wang, Alben Weinstein, John Buffington, R. Stephen Painter, Jr., Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Abra With Unregistered Offers And Sales Of Crypto Asset Securities - Abra Also Allegedly Operated As An Unregistered Investment Company</title>

<div> SEC, Abra, charges, investment company, settlement <br />
Summary: SEC charges Abra for offering unregistered securities to US investors, operating as an unregistered investment company, and violating registration provisions. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Plutus Lending LLC, which does business as Abra, for failing to register the offers and sales of its retail crypto asset lending product, Abra Earn. The SEC also charged Abra with operating as an unregistered investment company.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, in or around July 2020, Abra began to offer and sell Abra Earn in the United States. Abra Earn allowed U.S. investors to tender their crypto assets to Abra in exchange for Abra&rsquo;s promise to pay a variable interest rate. At its height, the Abra Earn program had approximately $600 million in assets, with nearly $500 million from U.S. investors. The complaint alleges that Abra marketed Abra Earn as a means for investors to earn interest on their crypto assets &ldquo;auto-magically,&rdquo; and that Abra exercised its discretion to use investors&rsquo; crypto assets in various ways to generate income for itself and to fund interest payments. The complaint further alleges that Abra Earn was offered and sold as a security and that the offers and sales did not qualify for an exemption from SEC registration.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleges that Abra operated for at least two years as an unregistered investment company because it issued securities and held more than 40 percent of its total assets, excluding cash, in investment securities, including its loans of crypto assets to institutional borrowers. According to the complaint, in June 2023, Abra began winding down the Abra Earn program and told its U.S.-based Abra Earn customers to withdraw their crypto assets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, Abra sold nearly half a billion dollars of securities to U.S. investors, without complying with registration laws designed to ensure that investors have sufficient, accurate information to make informed decisions before they invest,&rdquo; said Stacy Bogert, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;To compound the potential harm to investors, Abra allegedly sold its own securities while skirting applicable Investment Company Act provisions that provide a number of important protections to investors, including minimizing conflicts of interest. This matter reflects yet again, that in conducting enforcement investigations, we are governed by economic realities, not cosmetic labels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Abra with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 7(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. To settle the Commission&rsquo;s charges, Abra, without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, has consented to an injunction prohibiting it from violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act and requiring it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Brittany Frassetto and Kevin Hayne under the supervision of Pei Y. Chung and Ms. Bogert. The litigation will be led by Zachary Avallone and supervised by Christopher Bruckmann.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and Enforcement&rsquo;s Retail Strategy Task Force has previously issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-97">Investor Bulletin on Crypto Asset Interest-bearing Accounts</a>.

<div> whistleblower, SEC, awards, enforcement action, investor protection fund
<br />
The SEC awarded $24 million to two whistleblowers, with one receiving $4 million and the other receiving $20 million for their crucial assistance in successful enforcement actions. The whistleblowers' information helped uncover misconduct abroad, and their awards were funded by a investor protection fund established by Congress. The SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose their identity. 
<br /><br />Summary: The SEC awarded $24 million to two whistleblowers for critical assistance, funded by an investor protection fund, and protected their confidentiality. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced awards of more than $24 million to two whistleblowers whose information and assistance led to an SEC enforcement action and an action brought by another agency.</p>
<p>The first whistleblower will receive an award of $4 million, while the second whistleblower will receive an award of $20 million. While the first whistleblower reported first, prompting the opening of the investigation, the second whistleblower received the higher award, as their information and substantial cooperation proved critical to the success of the actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s awards highlight the incredible public service provided by whistleblowers,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower. &ldquo;The information would have been difficult to obtain in the absence of the whistleblowers as it pertained to conduct occurring abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Payments to whistleblowers are made out of an investor protection fund, established by Congress, which is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.&nbsp;Whistleblower awards can range from 10 to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<div> General Counsel, Director, Legal Department, retirement, contributions<br />
Summary:<br />
Rhoda Weeks-Brown, General Counsel of IMF, retiring after 27 years of groundbreaking leadership, reforms, and advocacy for diversity and inclusion. <div>
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), announced today that Rhoda Weeks-Brown intends to retire as General Counsel and Director of the Legal Department on September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda has been a pillar of the Fund&rsquo;s senior leadership team since becoming General Counsel in 2018. Her groundbreaking appointment&mdash;as the IMF&rsquo;s first female General Counsel and the first General Counsel to hail from a developing country&mdash;is a testament to her outstanding leadership, skills, and expertise,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva said. &ldquo;Furthermore, Rhoda has been an exemplary corporate citizen, serving as a prolific member of many important Fund committees, as a tireless coach and mentor to many staff, and as a relentless champion for diversity and inclusion both inside and outside the Fund,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva added.</p>
<p>During her 27 years of service, Ms. Weeks-Brown, a Liberian national, made significant contributions on a wide range of critical country, policy, and administrative matters. Among these, she played a key role in the design of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI); the transformation of the Fund&rsquo;s General Resources Account (GRA) lending tool kit and its lending facilities and financing framework for low-income countries; the design of a new income model for the Fund; key quota and governance reforms; and the institution&rsquo;s view on capital flows. Ms. Weeks-Brown also demonstrated her versatility by serving a stint as Deputy Director of the IMF&rsquo;s Communications Department, overseeing communications in Asia, Africa and Europe among other initiatives.</p>
<p>Since becoming General Counsel in 2018, Ms. Weeks-Brown has played the essential role of providing legal counsel to the Fund through a period of unprecedented and tremendous change. She led the Legal Department&rsquo;s work on major policy and administrative reforms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the establishment of the ground-breaking Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) that provides longer-term financing to member countries; other major reforms to the Fund&rsquo;s financing policies; the largest Special Drawing Right (SDR) allocation in the Fund&rsquo;s history; and several new macro-critical areas for the Fund, including climate and gender policy. Ms. Weeks-Brown has also played an instrumental role in the IMF&rsquo;s Institutional Safeguards Review (ISR), which aims to strengthen wide-ranging areas of the Fund&rsquo;s internal safeguards and governance. Another hallmark of Ms. Weeks-Brown&rsquo;s tenure as General Counsel has been her tireless advocacy for integrating good governance reforms into the Fund&rsquo;s policy advice, and for the importance of anti-corruption measures in improving the lives of people in IMF member countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda has contributed to virtually all aspects of the Fund&rsquo;s work. In addition to a sharp analytical mind and deep legal experience, she has been a passionate advocate for the importance of the Fund&rsquo;s work in a rapidly changing world,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva said. &ldquo;Her generous guidance, caring, and friendship will be missed by many of us.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Minister of Finance, Deputy Managing Director, IMF, Jamaica, economic reforms <br />
Summary:
Nigel Clarke appointed Deputy Managing Director of IMF, previously served as Jamaica's Minister of Finance, spearheaded economic reforms, private sector experience. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), announced today to the Executive Board her proposal to appoint Mr. Nigel Clarke to the position of Deputy Managing Director, effective October 31, 2024. He will succeed Ms. Antoinette Sayeh, who, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/07/17/pr-24277-imf-deputy-managing-director-antoinette-sayeh-to-retire-from-the-fund">previously announced</a>, steps down on September 12.</p>
<p>In announcing her selection of Mr. Clarke, Ms. Georgieva said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Clarke is an exceptional public servant and policymaker, with proven leadership in institution building and economic crisis management, who has stewarded&nbsp;his country&rsquo;s economy to a stronger and more sustainable position. Since 2016, he has been the IMF&rsquo;s chief counterpart on&nbsp;successive and historically successful programs for Jamaica, including an Extended Fund Facility, a precautionary Stand-By Arrangement, and most recently a Precautionary Liquidity Line plus Resilience and Sustainability Facility, leaving the country with robust economic fundamentals. Nigel also brings a wealth of experience from a stellar private sector career.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke has been Jamaica&rsquo;s Minister of Finance and the Public Service, and a Member of Parliament, since March 2018. Prior to this, he served as Ambassador of Economic Affairs from 2016. During this period, he spearheaded ambitious national reforms, including central bank independence, creation of an independent fiscal commission, as well as other tax policy, public body governance, public procurement, public sector compensation, and public investment management reforms. He also led Jamaica&rsquo;s economic policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic with innovative and well-targeted policy support and completed privatizations and public-private partnerships of major infrastructure assets. Under his stewardship, Jamaica implemented a multi-layered disaster risk financing model, and became the first small country to independently sponsor a catastrophe bond, with World Bank assistance. In 2023, Jamaica successfully completed its first ever international issue of a local currency denominated bond.</p>
<p>In 2022, Mr. Clarke was elected Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank and the Inter-American Investment Corporation. Prior to his public service career, he was Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of the Musson Group, a regional conglomerate, having started his career as an Equity Derivatives Trader at Goldman Sachs in London.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke holds a PhD in Numerical Analysis from Oxford University where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and a Master of Science Degree in Applied Statistics, also from Oxford, while he was a Commonwealth Scholar. He also holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of the West Indies where he was a Jamaica Independence Scholar.</p>

<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to expand its collaboration with Nissay Asset Management by licensing the Solactive Nippon Semiconductor Opportunity Index. This novel rule-based index tracks the performance of the top Japanese semiconductor-related companies and aims to provide clients with targeted exposure to the whole ecosystem of the semiconductor sector within the Japanese market. The index will serve as the underlying index for the Nissay S Nippon Semiconductor Equity Index Fund and marks the third collaboration between the two firms linked to the highly cost-competitive Nissay S Series.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Japanese government actively facilitates the tech industry through supportive policies and initiatives, enriching its global competitiveness. With an ambitious target to triple domestic semiconductor sales from 5 trillion JPY in 2020 to 15 trillion JPY by 2030, the government has invested about 4 trillion JPY from 2021 to 2023.<span><span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/nissay-asset-management-issues-nissay-s-nippon-semiconductor-equity-index-fund-tracking-the-solactive-nippon-semiconductor-opportunity-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>,<a href="https://www.solactive.com/nissay-asset-management-issues-nissay-s-nippon-semiconductor-equity-index-fund-tracking-the-solactive-nippon-semiconductor-opportunity-index/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></strong></p>

Adhering to strict selection criteria, the index goes beyond core semiconductor firms to include ancillary semiconductor industry participants such as suppliers and customers, spanning sectors like Electronic Components, Wholesale Distributors, and Medical Specialties. By capping core components at 15% and non-core components at 5% based on free-float market capitalization, the index ensures targeted exposure to key semiconductor businesses while offering comprehensive coverage of the broader semiconductor industry landscape.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nissay S Nippon Semiconductor Equity Index Fund will be launched on 4<span>th</span>&nbsp;September.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, comments</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are delighted to extend our partnership with Nissay Asset Management, and we are confident that our tailored solutions will empower clients to navigate changing market conditions.

<p class="component-text">Today, JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;JPXI&rdquo;) launched &ldquo;JPxData Portal (beta version)&rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Website&rdquo;), a portal site that comprehensively introduces data provided by Japan Exchange Group, Japan Exchange Group companies and partner companies (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;JPX Group, etc.&rdquo;).<br /><br />JPX Group, etc. currently provide over 200 types of data, which are used by a wide range of users, including investors, brokerage firms, and listed companies. However, JPXI received feedback that it is difficult for users to search through due to the overwhelmingly large amount of data and know what kind of data can be used for what. This feedback led us to the launch of Website providing users with easy access to data they seek and showing how to use the data.<br /><br />&ldquo;JPxData Portal&rdquo; is named after &ldquo;a data portal site of JPX Group, etc.&rdquo; and &ldquo;a place where &ldquo;Japan (JP)&rdquo; and &ldquo;data(Data)&rdquo; are combined&rdquo; with the letter &ldquo;x.&rdquo; JPXI will aim to develop Website further to make it an easy-to-use site, where any data on the Japanese market are accessible in the future.</p>

<li>The total market capitalization of the Equities Market at the end of the second quarter of 2024 was RUB 57.73 trln. Fees from the Equities Market grew by 47.9% on the back of a similar increase in trading volumes, which gained 45.0%. The effective fee was positively affected by the growing volumes of value-added, CCP-based OTC trading mode. Over 3.6 million clients were active every month during the quarter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fees and commissions from the Bond Market grew 26.2% on the back of the corresponding increase in trading volumes (excluding overnight bonds) of 26.8%, which was largely driven by the elevated primary market activity. Primary market trading volumes (excluding overnight bonds) went up 37.9%, while the secondary trading volumes increased by 18.1%. The supply of floating-rate issues supported the share of primary market volumes in the total volumes&rsquo; mix. However, floating-rate bonds have a lower trading velocity compared to fixed-rate bonds. Secondary trading of OFZs was up 25.3%; other bonds&rsquo; volumes were up 12.1%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Market fee income improved by 38.1%. Trading volumes added 34.6%. The slight discrepancy between fees and volumes was mainly attributable to the increase in shares of value-added CCP and GCC repo in the volumes&rsquo; mix. The effective fee was also supported by the increase of average GCC repo terms. The GCC repo segment also benefits from the rising demand for Russian-law money market ETFs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Depository and Settlement Services grew 10.6%. The growth is primarily explained by the 15.9% increase in the average value of assets under custody. The discrepancy between growth rates of fee income and assets on deposit is the result of business lines beyond safekeeping, primarily clearing and collateral management services, which reflect repo operations at the NSD.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derivatives Market fees grew by 53.3%, trading volumes were up 30.7%. The volumes&rsquo; mix changed towards higher value-added derivative contracts on commodities and interest rates. Specifically, commodity derivatives&rsquo; volumes doubled. The volumes of interest rate contracts surged 4.0x YoY amid the demand for interest rate hedging.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Information sales decreased by 1.2%. Sales of software and technical services were up by 13.9% because of a rise in demand for these products.

<title>Thailand Anti-Money Laundering Office, Thailand Securities And Exchange Commission, And Stock Exchange Of Thailand Strengthen Collaboration To Combat Illegal Securities Trading Activities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities, Exchange Act, Anti-money Laundering Act, Collaboration, Enforcement<br />
Summary:<br />
AMLO, SEC, and SET collaborate to fight illegal securities activities, tackle offenses, and boost investor confidence in the Thai capital market. <div>
<p>The Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) have strengthened their collaboration to fight against illegal securities trading activities under the Securities and Exchange Act and the Anti-money Laundering Act. This collaboration aims to dismantle economic criminal activities, particularly those related to securities trading, and to enhance the law enforcement capabilities of each agency as well as their joint operations. These efforts are expected to boost investor confidence in the Thai capital market. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Pichai Chunhavajira presided as the honorary witness at the signing ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for cooperation among the three agencies at the SET building.</p>
<p>AMLO Chairman&nbsp;Chatchai Phromlert and AMLO Secretary-General&nbsp;Theppasu Bavornchotidara&nbsp;emphasized AMLO&rsquo;s pivotal role in capital market oversight as a regulator of SET&rsquo;s securities member companies designated to report various transactions and as an enforcement agency against predicate offenses in the capital market. For cases involving violations of the Securities and Exchange Act, including stock manipulation and insider trading,</p>
<p>AMLO will work closely with the SEC, which directly regulates these securities companies and provides AMLO with detailed information on such offenses. AMLO also receives information from SET, which acts as the first-line inspector to detect suspicious trading activities. AMLO then takes over the investigation of financial transactions to facilitate asset-related legal actions, all within the framework of anti-money laundering laws.</p>
<p>In the past, regulatory agencies were perceived by investors as slow in their work, which hindered the effective prevention of crimes in the capital market and affected the image of the Thai capital market. This perception was partly due to the complexity of offenses and the large number of transactions involved.&nbsp; All relevant agencies, including AMLO, have had to carefully consider their actions within legal frameworks to avoid impacting the business sector.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s MOU signing assures the public that future securities violations will be met with swift and coordinated responses from relevant authorities. The MOU will also reduce work process redundancy and enhance the handover process between operator and law enforcement agencies to ensure faster and more efficient action within their respective legal boundaries.</p>
<p><b>SEC Chairman Professor Wisit Wisitsora-at&nbsp;</b>stated that the capital market is a hub for fundraising from both domestic and international investors. Economic crimes in this sector not only cause direct harm to investors but also have broader implications for the country&rsquo;s overall economy. Over the past few years, several major cases have surfaced in the capital market, involving significant financial damages and widespread impacts.</p>
<p>Upon taking his position, Professor Wisit aimed to enhance capital market confidence through improved governance and more efficient as well as timely law enforcement against offenders. He expressed satisfaction with this three-agency collaboration, viewing it as a significant milestone in narrowing operational gaps and increasing law enforcement effectiveness.</p>
<p><b>SEC Secretary-General Professor Pornanong Budsaratragoon</b>&nbsp;revealed that the SEC has been collaborating with AMLO and SET through bilateral agreements on coordination and information sharing for law enforcement purposes. This new trilateral MOU is expected to deepen cooperation in information exchange, coordination, and the potential formation of joint task forces when necessary. The goal is to improve prevention and enforcement efforts against unfair securities trading practices, embezzlement, fraud, and financial misconduct under the Securities and Exchange Act B.E. 2535 (1992) considered predicate offenses under the Anti-Money Laundering Act that impact investor confidence and economic development.</p>
<p><b>SET Chairman Adjunct Professor Kitipong Urapeepatanapong</b>&nbsp;said that the MOU among AMLO, the SEC, and SET aims to address the need for swift action against offenders. The agreement focuses on streamlining work processes, including facilitating seamless information sharing and eliminating redundancies in data collection among law enforcement agencies to shorten the time required for investigation and enforcement processes. Additionally, leveraging AMLO&rsquo;s legal processes to swiftly prosecute offenders in cases with substantial social and investor impact can help restore investor confidence and deter potential wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s signing of the MOU marks a remarkable collaboration to prevent and suppress securities-related offenses,&nbsp;setting the stage for&nbsp;more integrated efforts among justice-related agencies to take swifter and stronger legal action against offenders.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b>&nbsp;said that recent incidents involving listed companies had shaken domestic and international investor confidence. SET recognizes the importance of collaboration among agencies within the justice system to deter and swiftly enforce legal actions against offenders. Such efforts are crucial in restoring and strengthening investor confidence in the Thai capital market. SET has continuously engaged in discussions and cooperation with the SEC, AMLO, and other relevant agencies. This ongoing collaboration has culminated in the signing of the MOU among the three organizations today, aimed at coordinating efforts to prevent and combat securities trading violations. This MOU marks a significant step forward in enhancing the oversight of the Thai capital market. SET is confident that the integrated efforts of these involved agencies will contribute to the sustainable strengthening of the Thai capital market.</p>

<div> sales, profit, mai-listed companies, financial position, market capitalization <br />
Summary: mai-listed firms on Market for Alternative Investment (mai) showed strong performance in H1 2024 with increased sales, operating profit, and net profit. Financial position also improved. <div>
<ul>
<li><b>Mai-listed firms&rsquo; H1 sales up 7.7% y-o-y to THB 104.3 bln</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">H1 operating profit up 44.8% y-o-y to THB 8.35 bln</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">H1 net profit up 80.5% y-o-y to THB 6.10 bln</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies listed on Market for Alternative Investment (mai) reported robust performance for the first half of 2024, with total sales reaching THB 104.30 billion (approx. USD&nbsp; billion), a 7.7 percent increase year-on-year. Despite increases in the cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses, efficient management led to a remarkable 44.8 percent year-on-year jump in the first-half operating profit.</p>
<p><b>mai President Prapan Charoenprawatt</b> said that 212 mai-listed companies, representing 96 percent of the total 221 companies (excluding those in the non-compliance or NC list and those with different closing dates for accounting periods), submitted their operating results for the January-to-June period of 2024. Of these, 152 companies, or 72 percent of those submitted financial statements, reported net profit.</p>
<p>For the first six months of 2024, mai-listed companies' sales rose by 7.7 percent over the same period a year before while the cost of goods sold increased at a slower pace of 5.6 percent, resulting in a 13.6 percent rise in gross profit to THB 28.08 billion. Selling, general, and administrative expenses totalled THB 19.73 billion, up 4.1 percent over the same period last year. Operating profit and net profit surged by 44.8 percent and 80.5 percent, to the tune of THB 8.35 billion and THB 6.10 billion, respectively.

<p>&ldquo;The overall performance of mai-listed companies in the first half of 2024 showed improvement. Companies have effectively managed costs and selling and administrative expenses since the first quarter of this year, enhancing their profitability. Sales growth was seen in almost all industry groups, except for the Resources, which recorded a slight decline. However, nearly all industry groups experienced growth in operating profit and net profit, with only the Consumer goods and Technology reporting a decline in profit,&rdquo; said Prapan.</p>
<p>Regarding the financial position, mai-listed companies reported total assets of THB 333.75 billion, up 3.0 percent from the end of the previous year, with a debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio reducing to 0.76 times from 0.77 times at the end of 2023.</p>

<br />
SET-listed companies' H1 sales grew 6.3%, with net profit up 9.7%. Mai-listed companies also saw strong growth in sales and profits.
<br /><br />Summary: 
SET-listed firms saw significant sales and profit growth in H1, driven by tourism and rising oil prices, while mai-listed companies also reported strong performance. <div>
<ul>
<li><b>SET-listed firms&rsquo; H1 sales up 6.3% y-o-y to </b><b>THB 8.96 trln</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">H1 core operating profit</b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;"> </b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">up 18.7% y-o-y to </b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">THB 922.74 bln</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">H1 net profit up 9.7%</b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;"> y-o-y </b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">to THB 519.31 bln</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)-listed companies delivered significant growth in both top-line and bottom-line figures for the first six months, buoyed by a robust tourism sector and rising oil prices. The positive impact of tourism rippled across services and consumer goods industry groups, while the oil-related sector benefitted from favorable market conditions.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b> said that 819 listed companies, representing 95.7 percent of the total 856 listed companies (comprising SET- and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)-listed companies, excluding property funds and infrastructure funds, scheduled to submit financial statements ended June 30, 2024) already submitted their second-quarter operating results. Of these, 631 listed companies, accounting for 77.05 percent of those submitted financial statements, reported net profit.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, listed companies continued their growth trajectory, with those on SET experiencing an 8.4 percent year-on-year increase in sales. This contributed to a 6.3 percent year-over-year rise in the first-half sales for SET-listed companies, amounting to THB 8.96 trillion (approx. USD 227.84 billion). Core operating profit and net profit surged 18.7 percent and 9.7 percent in the first six months of 2024 from a year earlier to THB 922.74 billion and THB 519.31 billion, respectively. The improved performance was attributable to a mere 4.9 percent and 6.0 percent increase in production costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses. As of June 30, 2024, the debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio of Thai listed companies (excluding the financial sector) remained stable at 1.51 times.</p>
<p>"The continued expansion of the tourism sector significantly boosted profits across service-related and associated businesses, such as food and beverages, consumer goods, hotels, aviation, space rental, retail, healthcare, and telecommunications. Higher oil prices also bolstered the oil sector, leading to strong operational and net profit growth for listed companies in the first half of 2024. However, the property development and construction sectors faced challenges due to decreased public and private sector projects,&rdquo; added Pakorn.</p>

<div> Whistleblower, SEC, enforcement action, award, investor protection fund
Summary:<br />SEC awards $98 million to two whistleblowers for information leading to enforcement actions. Whistleblowers provide critical assistance and may receive 10-30% of sanctions. Confidentiality is protected. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced awards of more than $98 million to two whistleblowers whose information and assistance led to an SEC enforcement action and an action brought by another agency.</p>
<p>The first whistleblower&rsquo;s tip prompted the opening of the investigations, and thereafter provided critical additional information and ongoing assistance. As a result, this whistleblower will receive an award of $82 million. The second whistleblower, whose information was provided later, significantly contributed to one aspect of the actions and will receive an award of $16 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whistleblower information and cooperation play an integral role in the SEC&rsquo;s enforcement efforts,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower. &ldquo;Without these whistleblowers&rsquo; information, the violations would have been difficult to detect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Payments to whistleblowers are made out of an investor protection fund, established by Congress, which is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.&nbsp;Whistleblower awards can range from 10 to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">From early 2020, the Covid pandemic and then the war in Ukraine caused a surge in inflation around the globe. These events, and the nature of policymakers&rsquo; responses to each, have laid bare the challenges and trade-offs inherent in addressing both monetary policy and financial stability shocks. In this speech Andrew Bailey reflects on recent times and discusses what we can learn in terms of our framework for assessing the extent to which inflation may be persistent, and how various types of shock might be dealt with in the future.</span></div>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I want to use my time to look behind the latest state of monetary policy, at issues that have arisen from the experience of recent years, but with some reflections on where we are now.</p>
<p>The pandemic caused a sudden, coincident and precipitous fall in global demand and supply &ndash; one of these did not obviously lead the other. Moreover, in March 2020 we faced monetary policy and financial stability issues arising from the same source, namely the pandemic. Taken separately, the responses should be different, with a more exceptional temporary, targeted and typically maximum force intervention better suited to dealing with a financial stability problem. In contrast, a monetary policy response of the sort used in 2020 is typically undertaken over time. But when monetary policy and financial stability issues coincide, the judgement becomes more complicated. By engaging both of the core central bank objectives, the pandemic posed an unusual but not unprecedented challenge.</p>
<p>As economies started to adjust to the consequences of the pandemic there was a substantial increase in global demand for goods rather than services, at a time when the supply of goods remained disrupted and restricted. This was an asymmetric demand shock. Global goods prices rose as a result, akin to a cost-push shock for open economies like the UK. This was the context of the so-called transitory assessment of monetary policy, namely that such shocks should be short-lived in impact because supply chains should recover and inflation expectations should remain anchored in anticipation of that recovery. That&rsquo;s the theory. The evidence suggests that, taken on its own, the global supply chain shock had run its course by the end of 2022. But a key question at that time was whether and to what extent there would also be catch-up effects in wages and services prices, and over what time period?</p>
<p>In the UK, the labour market did begin to tighten but it was hard to discern at the time by how much. In mid- to late-2021 the UK Government&rsquo;s furlough scheme &ndash; a sensible policy in its own right &ndash; was creating uncertainty around the state of the labour market. We can now use tools such as the Bernanke-Blanchard approach to assess the timing and scale of this labour market effect.</p>
<p>Using this approach, and based on work done on the UK case by my colleague Jonathan Haskel, it became evident economy-wide in late 2021 and early 2022, putting further upward pressure on inflation. We started to tighten monetary policy from late 2021.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/august/andrew-bailey-speech-federal-reserve-bank-of-kansas-annual-jackson-hole-economic-policy-symposium#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Then, starting in February 2022, came the impact of the Ukraine War and Russia&rsquo;s illegal actions. This created large supply shocks, in particular to energy and food prices. It substantially increased the risk of de-anchoring of inflation expectations and created the potential for larger second round effects in the form of more persistent higher inflation. As shock came upon shock, so to speak, the transitory judgement looked less appropriate.</p>
<p>Our response in terms of both the pace and scale of tightening was progressive but measured. Why? Four reasons stand out for me.</p>
<p>First, unlike in March 2020, in 2022 there was not a coincident financial stability shock. It could have happened, for instance in commodity finance markets, but in the event such a shock did not occur.</p>
<p>Second, the scale of the indirect or second round monetary policy effects was unclear at the time. There were several sources of such uncertainty. One was the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Looking again at the UK case, in terms of the impact of a tightening phase on economic activity and inflation, the channels of transmission have changed over time. This no doubt reflects underlying changes in the economy since the previous tightening phase which was prior to the Global Financial Crisis, most obviously the shift from variable- to fixed-rate mortgages. But it most likely also reflects specific features of the latest tightening phase. One such feature is that it followed an extended period when interest rates were near the lower bound, along with the use of unconventional policy measures, both of which contributed to a relatively fast increase in longer-term market rates when the tightening came. A second feature of this tightening phase has been the size of the shocks we have witnessed and the potential non-linearities and asymmetries that have arisen in the monetary transmission mechanism. When we are dealing with relatively small shocks which stay within the locality around the inflation target where the linear approximations we normally make in our models hold, then these issues do not arise. That was the experience during much of the inflation targeting era.</p>
<p>But when there are big shocks that move outside this locality, such as those of recent years, then non-linearities and asymmetries can emerge. But, at the time, the impact of this was more uncertain.</p>
<p>The third reason for a measured response was that a very fast and large response of interest rates would have risked creating a severe economic shock of its own (a trade-off). I will come back to this point.</p>
<p>Fourth, while in Europe &ndash; and here I refer to Europe in a geographical sense - demand was recovering faster than supply, levels of activity were well below actual and potential levels pre-Covid, leaving substantial questions around how much slack there was.</p>
<p>To bring the story up to date. Headline inflation has since fallen sharply as energy and food price shocks in particular have fallen away. Global goods price inflation has also fallen back sharply, with supply chains restoring themselves and with signs of strong disinflation emerging in some key supplier countries most obviously China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, monetary policy has been leaning heavily against the indirect and second round inflation effects and the persistence thereof. The job of monetary policy &ndash; which it has been doing &ndash; is to squeeze the persistent element of inflation out of the system in a way that is consistent with returning inflation to its target on a timely and sustained basis.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/august/andrew-bailey-speech-federal-reserve-bank-of-kansas-annual-jackson-hole-economic-policy-symposium#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;When we think about inflation persistence, I would distinguish between extrinsic persistence (the duration of external shocks) and intrinsic persistence in the sense of capturing the impact of the echo effects of those external shocks owing to domestic responses (second round effects). Extrinsic inflation persistence is a setting where price and wage setting behaviour remains unchanged, but a succession of external inflationary shocks cause inflation to be above targe for a sustained period. Since the lags in the transmission of monetary policy are typically longer than the lags in the transmission of these shocks to inflation, some volatility of inflation is inevitable, and with the type of big shocks we saw, all going in the same direction, the impact will be large. Contrast this with intrinsic inflation persistence where price and wage setting behaviour does change, including in response to the unusual character of the external shocks. Here, the nature of the response of monetary policy needs to be different. The reality is that we experienced both types of persistence, though the scale of the intrinsic persistence has &ndash; almost of necessity &ndash; been harder to judge and therefore more subject to revision.</p>
<p>I think we are now seeing a revision down in our assessment of that intrinsic persistence, but this is not something we can take for granted. Important questions remain which in many ways set the framework through which we now view monetary policy.</p>
<p>On current evidence, and speaking of the UK, I would say that the persistent element is still with us but it is smaller in magnitude now than we expected a year ago, and considerably smaller than the type of persistence that was seen in the 1970s. However, that is not the end of the story. We still face the question of whether this persistent element is on course to decline to a level consistent with inflation being at target on a sustained basis and what it will take to make that happen. Is the decline of persistence now almost baked in as the shocks to headline inflation unwind, or will it also require a negative output gap to open up, or are we experiencing a more permanent change to price, wage and margin setting which would require monetary policy to remain tighter for longer? This framework is now prominent in our thinking on the MPC.</p>
<p>The first of these cases is the more benign &ndash; the persistence is essentially self-correcting with the degree of restriction we have in place today easing off over time. &ldquo;Self-correcting&rdquo; is the key phrase here: it depends on the credibility of monetary policy, which depends on the willingness of policymakers to act, and the best evidence to support this mechanism is well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations.</p>
<p>The second case is the intermediate one. Here we would need to maintain restriction for longer and thus open up more of an output gap.</p>
<p>The last case is least benign and would require more restrictive policy than the first two cases. It would suggest that there are structural changes in product and labour markets going on which are causing the supply side of the economy to change as a lasting legacy of the major shocks we have experienced. To be clear, as policymakers we can have all three of these cases in our expectations, with different weights attached.</p>
<p>Tentatively, it appears to me that the economic costs of bringing down persistent inflation &ndash; costs in terms of lower output and higher unemployment &ndash; could be less than in the past. This is consistent with a process of disinflation which is steady and more in keeping with a soft landing than a recession induced process. For the UK, this is consistent with how we have revised our outlook for growth, and the numbers themselves so far this year.</p>
<p>Inflation expectations appear to be better anchored, which I put down in good part to the presence of independent central banks with clear mandates and nominal anchors, usually in the form of inflation targets. But, crucially, policy does have to respond to ensure credibility is maintained. Moreover, while second round effects may be smaller that does not tell us how much smaller and less persistent they will eventually end up being than in the past. On this basis, at the moment I put more weight on the first case &ndash; self-correction - but some smaller weight on each of the other two. These weights can of course change over time.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/august/andrew-bailey-speech-federal-reserve-bank-of-kansas-annual-jackson-hole-economic-policy-symposium#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is an important issue of the moment for monetary policy. It is directly relevant to the question of how challenging the last mile of returning to our inflation target level on a sustained basis actually will be. The well-known argument goes that an independent central bank operating a transparent low inflation target successfully over time will anchor inflation expectations more consistently. In this world, in the short-run monetary policy can respond to shocks with suitable flexibility, acting consistently but not always identically, to return inflation to target. In the UK case, the evidence suggests this may have worked insofar as we are seeing a lower level of inflation persistence than we expected a year ago. But, we need to be cautious because the job is not completed &ndash; we are not yet back to target on a sustained basis. Policy setting will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation remaining sustainably around the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The course will therefore be a steady one.</p>
<p>Before considering challenges going forward, I want to pull out one further point from recent experience. In an effective monetary policy regime we should have flexibility in the short term on how quickly we return inflation to target. Looking back over recent years, I think it is common ground that the Covid and Ukraine shocks could not have been anticipated, and certainly not in sufficient time for any consequent monetary policy actions to have had an effect on monetary conditions. But there are two follow-up questions that I get asked. One starts with the words &ldquo;with the benefit of hindsight&rdquo; what would you have done. The second, asks about actual policy choices once the shocks took effect.</p>
<p>This is where so-called trade-offs come into the picture. The language of the Bank of England remit states that &ldquo;the inflation target holds at all times&rdquo;, which is essential. But it also states that &ldquo;the actual inflation rate will on occasion depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It further adds that &ldquo;attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output&rdquo;. In 2013 the remit was amended by adding that where shocks are particularly large or the effects of shocks may persist over an extended period (or both) then&ldquo;the Committee is likely to be faced with more significant trade-offs between the speed with which it aims to bring inflation back to target and the consideration that should be placed on the variability of output&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is what we call the trade-off language. We are not alone in having this type of language in our remit. The language applies when the economy is hit by temporary cost or supply shocks. In these circumstances we have to judge the appropriate balance of inflation and output volatility, when judging how quickly to bring inflation back to target. Moreover, such judgement must ensure that, again using the language of our remit, &ldquo;inflation expectations are firmly anchored in the medium term&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Applying this framework over the Covid and Ukraine period has not been easy. As policymakers dealing with the here and now, balancing the objectives of applying the inflation target at all times and dealing with trade-off situations requires us to decide whether to look through a transitory shock or respond because it could have<br />quasi-permanent features. In doing so of course we must distinguish between these two shocks in real time. Good luck with that as they say. It has required judgement on whether the shocks were temporary or not, and whether they were expected to be so or not by participants in the economy. The further complication is that the configuration of shocks &ndash; with no gaps between them - effectively meant that the judgements had to be reached on the shocks as a collective more than individually.</p>
<p>The UK was hit by a severe terms of trade shock, raising the rate of inflation in imported goods and services relative to domestic prices, leading to a sharp fall in household real incomes, something that could not be offset by monetary policy. But let us say we had seen all of this coming in sufficient time to act given the lags in the transmission of monetary policy. In that case, the remit trade-off language would have to be taken into consideration. A negative terms of trade shock involved a sharp fall in real incomes and wages.</p>
<p>If monetary policy had acted to offset this shock, it would have required a much larger fall in domestic prices and wages in order to counteract inflation in import prices. It would have required domestic prices and wages to fall in nominal terms. Achieving this effect would have called for a substantial rise in interest rates creating a strong probability of a deep recession and a steep rise in unemployment. Moreover, it would not have led to inflation being at target on a sustained basis &ndash; which is our objective. Rather, as energy and food prices fell back, inflation would fall below target.</p>
<p>Put simply, responding in this way to short-lived shocks is not consistent with our remit nor is it the way to ensure the policy framework remains robust. That said, the trade-off element of our remit leaves us with the judgemental challenge of how to assess and respond to the impact of supply shocks on inflation, particularly when they are accompanied by demand pressure.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/august/andrew-bailey-speech-federal-reserve-bank-of-kansas-annual-jackson-hole-economic-policy-symposium#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;What is the best way to make sure inflation expectations are anchored, and how do we judge in real time whether they are anchored, accepting that short-run expectations will move with headline inflation measures? The judgement therefore remains one of to what extent central banks can look through such shocks, or not, all of which will be state contingent.</p>
<p>So, let me draw out what I see as key challenges for central banks arising from these experiences. Modern monetary policy with its emphasis on independent responsibilities, clear policy objectives and nominal anchors typically in the form of an inflation target is the product of tackling the great inflation of the 1970s. More recent experience defines at least three challenges to that orthodoxy.</p>
<p>First, how to operate monetary policy near to the lower bound of interest rates when the challenge is to raise not lower inflation. Moreover, if the response has to go beyond moving the official short-term interest rate, the policies adopted to counter disinflation will take longer to wind down and have implications that are more spread out and open to contestation.</p>
<p>Second, in a more uncertain and volatile world, how to set policy in an environment where shocks may or may not be short-lived &ndash; either individually or collectively - and where they may create conditions where judging trade-offs between inflation and activity play a large part.</p>
<p>Third, how to ensure that we can at all times meet both our monetary policy and financial stability objectives, including when they may be pointing in opposite directions, and in particular that central banks have the necessary operational tools and can use them at all times if required. Recent experiences indicate the larger role of the financial stability objective in modern central banking in contrast to the orthodoxy of the post-1970s era when monetary policy alone came to the fore. This rebalancing in some ways takes us back to the earlier classical gold standard era of central banking. But in modern central banking, the separation principle is much more important than it was in the classical era. By this I mean distinguishing between, and communicating the distinction between, monetary policy and financial stability actions.</p>
<p>Looking at recent experience in the UK, the so-called LDI event was clearly a financial stability not monetary policy one, and the challenge was to structure the intervention and communicate it in a way that reinforced this point. The March 2020 &ldquo;dash for cash&rdquo; was more complicated because it arose in the context of both financial stability and monetary policy events (the latter in the sense of the severe and unexpected recession). How to structure and communicate the policy response by central banks in this &ndash; hopefully highly unusual - situation deserves more attention. That said, in the normal state of affairs we are moving to a world where our standard operations meet the system&rsquo;s demand for liquidity in normal times, and not more than that. Against this backdrop, monetary policy can most effectively set the official interest rate. In normal conditions, meeting the demand for liquidity &ndash; most obviously through the level of reserves banks choose to hold &ndash; should also support financial stability. Beyond that, we must then have a set of effective and usable exceptional tools for financial stability stresses including when they arise in the non-bank part of the financial sector.</p>
<p>The classical gold standard was an era of prolonged monetary stability punctuated by the need to respond rapidly and forcefully to financial stability shocks, and in doing so preserve monetary stability. Walter Bagehot&rsquo;s critique of the Bank of England in the classical gold standard era was for not responding in a timely and forceful way to financial stability shocks. In the Covid-Ukraine era central banks did respond rapidly and forcefully. Some would still say we did too much. I disagree with that assessment. But I do think that going forwards &ndash; and as we experienced positively with the LDI crisis &ndash; rediscovering the distinctive roles of monetary and financial stability actions will help us. Financial stability issues themselves create macroeconomic trade-offs which can affect monetary policy.</p>
<p>But these will naturally fit within the framework of monetary policy. This is what we did in March 2020. That said, distinguishing the handling of primary monetary policy and financial stability shocks, and having more targeted tools in our boxes, will I am sure assist with the inevitably hard job of policy making.</p>
<p>To conclude, the challenge for monetary policy of the Covid-Ukraine era could not have been to prevent the inflation happening. To attempt to do that would have been to ignore the trade-off element of our remit. Put more directly, as Ben Bernanke did in his report, it would have led to a depression and thus a repeat of the errors of the 1920s.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/august/andrew-bailey-speech-federal-reserve-bank-of-kansas-annual-jackson-hole-economic-policy-symposium#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;Rather, the task for central banks was to produce an orderly return of inflation to target, with expectations anchored.</p>
<p>Recent experience leads me to be cautiously optimistic that inflation expectations are better anchored as a result of the regimes we have in place. The second round inflation effects appear to be smaller than we expected. But it is too early to declare victory. Policy does have to react &ndash; the regime works because we use it.</p>
<p>Economies - and the UK is a good example here - are in a stronger and more resilient position as a result of the actions taken over recent years. A key point here is not to do with the immediate situation and prospects. It is that the underlying resilience of economies and financial systems should be sufficient to enable sizeable market movements and risk asset price corrections to occur without threatening stability. This is the lesson from Bagehot in the nineteenth century. His diagnosis was that flaws in the response to financial stability events undermined monetary stability, at that time in the form of the classical Gold Standard. Similar diagnoses have been made around the Great Depression and the Global Financial Crisis. This explains why we have done so much to build stronger financial stability buffers over the last fifteen years since the GFC. This is the best way to support resilient and competitive financial systems and strong economies. Market events like those of two weeks ago or so will happen; the test is not whether they happen but whether they trigger wider instability. As central banks we operate within systems that are framed by law and institutions to create and preserve stability and prosperity in the public interest.</p>
<p>All that said, communicating policy is harder in uncertain conditions with large shocks. Communication is complicated where we have to operate to achieve both our monetary policy and financial stability objectives, with the latter typically being a matter of operating in an emergency in such conditions. Likewise, communicating when we decide to accommodate short-run shocks and/or there is a trade-off between inflation and activity involved is essential but difficult. These are all areas that will benefit from further assessment.</p>

<div> letter, CFTC regulations, DCOs, EU, UK <br />
Summary:<br />
The CFTC issued a new letter addressing regulations for EU and UK-based DCOs, updating a previous letter to include post-Brexit UK-based DCOs. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR) today issued a no-action letter to address the applicability of certain CFTC regulations to registered derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) based in either the European Union (EU) or the United Kingdom (UK). This letter replaces CFTC Letter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/csl/16-26/download">16-26</a>, which applied only to EU-based DCOs and was issued in 2016 as part of the CFTC&rsquo;s response to the EU equivalence determination with regard to the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory framework for DCOs. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7342-16">7342-16</a>]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At that time, the UK was a part of the EU, and therefore, CFTC Letter 16-26 also applied to DCOs based in the UK. After withdrawing from the EU in 2019, the UK adopted and retained the EU regulatory framework for central counterparties (CCPs) in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation. The UK&rsquo;s HM Treasury subsequently published a statutory instrument concluding the CFTC&rsquo;s regime for regulating DCOs is equivalent to the UK&rsquo;s regime for regulating CCPs. Given these developments, DCR has updated CFTC Letter 16-26 to explicitly apply it to UK-based DCOs post-Brexit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>

Anchored inflation expectations were crucial.<br /><br />Summary: The pandemic caused inflation to rise due to demand and supply distortions. Central bank policies helped bring about disinflation without a sharp rise in unemployment. Anchored inflation expectations were crucial. <div>
<div class="row">
<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Four and a half years after COVID-19's arrival, the worst of the pandemic-related economic distortions are fading. Inflation has declined significantly. The labor market is no longer overheated, and conditions are now less tight than those that prevailed before the pandemic. Supply constraints have normalized. And the balance of the risks to our two mandates has changed. Our objective has been to restore price stability while maintaining a strong labor market, avoiding the sharp increases in unemployment that characterized earlier disinflationary episodes when inflation expectations were less well anchored. We have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome. While the task is not complete, we have made a good deal of progress toward that outcome.</p>
<p>Today, I will begin by addressing the current economic situation and the path ahead for monetary policy. I will then turn to a discussion of economic events since the pandemic arrived, exploring why inflation rose to levels not seen in a generation, and why it has fallen so much while unemployment has remained low.</p>
<p><strong>Near-Term Outlook for Policy</strong><br />Let's begin with the current situation and the near-term outlook for policy.</p>
<p>For much of the past three years, inflation ran well above our 2 percent goal, and labor market conditions were extremely tight. The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary focus has been on bringing down inflation, and appropriately so. Prior to this episode, most Americans alive today had not experienced the pain of high inflation for a sustained period. Inflation brought substantial hardship, especially for those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. High inflation triggered stress and a sense of unfairness that linger today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Our restrictive monetary policy helped restore balance between aggregate supply and demand, easing inflationary pressures and ensuring that inflation expectations remained well anchored. Inflation is now much closer to our objective, with prices having risen 2.5 percent over the past 12 months (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure1-20240823.png" id="fig1">figure 1</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;After a pause earlier this year, progress toward our 2 percent objective has resumed. My confidence has grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Turning to employment, in the years just prior to the pandemic, we saw the significant benefits to society that can come from a long period of strong labor market conditions: low unemployment, high participation, historically low racial employment gaps, and, with inflation low and stable, healthy real wage gains that were increasingly concentrated among those with lower incomes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Today, the labor market has cooled considerably from its formerly overheated state. The unemployment rate began to rise over a year ago and is now at 4.3 percent&mdash;still low by historical standards, but almost a full percentage point above its level in early 2023 (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure2-20240823.png" id="fig2">figure 2</a>). Most of that increase has come over the past six months. So far, rising unemployment has not been the result of elevated layoffs, as is typically the case in an economic downturn. Rather, the increase mainly reflects a substantial increase in the supply of workers and a slowdown from the previously frantic pace of hiring. Even so, the cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable. Job gains remain solid but have slowed this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Job vacancies have fallen, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has returned to its pre-pandemic range. The hiring and quits rates are now below the levels that prevailed in 2018 and 2019. Nominal wage gains have moderated. All told, labor market conditions are now less tight than just before the pandemic in 2019&mdash;a year when inflation ran below 2 percent. It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon. We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace. But the inflation and labor market data show an evolving situation. The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased. As we highlighted in our last FOMC statement, we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</p>
<p>The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p>We will do everything we can to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability. With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labor market. The current level of our policy rate gives us ample room to respond to any risks we may face, including the risk of unwelcome further weakening in labor market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise and Fall of Inflation</strong><br />Let's now turn to the questions of why inflation rose, and why it has fallen so significantly even as unemployment has remained low. There is a growing body of research on these questions, and this is a good time for this discussion.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;It is, of course, too soon to make definitive assessments. This period will be analyzed and debated long after we are gone.</p>
<p>The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic led quickly to shutdowns in economies around the world. It was a time of radical uncertainty and severe downside risks. As so often happens in times of crisis, Americans adapted and innovated. Governments responded with extraordinary force, especially in the U.S. Congress unanimously passed the CARES Act. At the Fed, we used our powers to an unprecedented extent to stabilize the financial system and help stave off an economic depression.</p>
<p>After a historically deep but brief recession, in mid-2020 the economy began to grow again. As the risks of a severe, extended downturn receded, and as the economy reopened, we faced the risk of replaying the painfully slow recovery that followed the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Congress delivered substantial additional fiscal support in late 2020 and again in early 2021. Spending recovered strongly in the first half of 2021. The ongoing pandemic shaped the pattern of the recovery. Lingering concerns over COVID weighed on spending on in-person services. But pent-up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic changes in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods.</p>
<p>The pandemic also wreaked havoc on supply conditions. Eight million people left the workforce at its onset, and the size of the labor force was still 4 million below its pre-pandemic level in early 2021. The labor force would not return to its pre-pandemic trend until mid-2023 (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure3-20240823.png" id="fig3">figure 3</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Supply chains were snarled by a combination of lost workers, disrupted international trade linkages, and tectonic shifts in the composition and level of demand (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure4-20240823.png" id="fig4">figure 4</a>). Clearly, this was nothing like the slow recovery after the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Enter inflation. After running below target through 2020, inflation spiked in March and April 2021. The initial burst of inflation was concentrated rather than broad based, with extremely large price increases for goods in short supply, such as motor vehicles. My colleagues and I judged at the outset that these pandemic-related factors would not be persistent and, thus, that the sudden rise in inflation was likely to pass through fairly quickly without the need for a monetary policy response&mdash;in short, that the inflation would be transitory. Standard thinking has long been that, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, it can be appropriate for central banks to look through a temporary rise in inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>The good ship Transitory was a crowded one, with most mainstream analysts and advanced-economy central bankers on board.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;The common expectation was that supply conditions would improve reasonably quickly, that the rapid recovery in demand would run its course, and that demand would rotate back from goods to services, bringing inflation down.</p>
<p>For a time, the data were consistent with the transitory hypothesis. Monthly readings for core inflation declined every month from April to September 2021, although progress came slower than expected (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure5-20240823.png" id="fig5">figure 5</a>). The case began to weaken around midyear, as was reflected in our communications. Beginning in October, the data turned hard against the transitory hypothesis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Inflation rose and broadened out from goods into services. It became clear that the high inflation was not transitory, and that it would require a strong policy response if inflation expectations were to remain well anchored. We recognized that and pivoted beginning in November. Financial conditions began to tighten. After phasing out our asset purchases, we lifted off in March 2022.</p>
<p>By early 2022, headline inflation exceeded 6 percent, with core inflation above 5 percent. New supply shocks appeared. Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp increase in energy and commodity prices. The improvements in supply conditions and rotation in demand from goods to services were taking much longer than expected, in part due to further COVID waves in the U.S.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;And COVID continued to disrupt production globally, including through new and extended lockdowns in China.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>High rates of inflation were a global phenomenon, reflecting common experiences: rapid increases in the demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;The global nature of inflation was unlike any period since the 1970s. Back then, high inflation became entrenched&mdash;an outcome we were utterly committed to avoiding.</p>
<p>By mid-2022, the labor market was extremely tight, with employment increasing by over 6-1/2 million from the middle of 2021. This increase in labor demand was met, in part, by workers rejoining the labor force as health concerns began to fade. But labor supply remained constrained, and, in the summer of 2022, labor force participation remained well below pre-pandemic levels. There were nearly twice as many job openings as unemployed persons from March 2022 through the end of the year, signaling a severe labor shortage (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure6-20240823.png" id="fig6">figure 6</a>).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Inflation peaked at 7.1 percent in June 2022.</p>
<p>At this podium two years ago, I discussed the possibility that addressing inflation could bring some pain in the form of higher unemployment and slower growth. Some argued that getting inflation under control would require a recession and a lengthy period of high unemployment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;I expressed our unconditional commitment to fully restoring price stability and to keeping at it until the job is done.</p>
<p>The FOMC did not flinch from carrying out our responsibilities, and our actions forcefully demonstrated our commitment to restoring price stability. We raised our policy rate by 425 basis points in 2022 and another 100 basis points in 2023. We have held our policy rate at its current restrictive level since July 2023 (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/powell-figure7-20240823.png" id="fig7">figure 7</a>).</p>
<p>The summer of 2022 proved to be the peak of inflation. The 4-1/2 percentage point decline in inflation from its peak two years ago has occurred in a context of low unemployment&mdash;a welcome and historically unusual result.</p>
<p>How did inflation fall without a sharp rise in unemployment above its estimated natural rate?</p>
<p>Pandemic-related distortions to supply and demand, as well as severe shocks to energy and commodity markets, were important drivers of high inflation, and their reversal has been a key part of the story of its decline. The unwinding of these factors took much longer than expected but ultimately played a large role in the subsequent disinflation. Our restrictive monetary policy contributed to a moderation in aggregate demand, which combined with improvements in aggregate supply to reduce inflationary pressures while allowing growth to continue at a healthy pace. As labor demand also moderated, the historically high level of vacancies relative to unemployment has normalized primarily through a decline in vacancies, without sizable and disruptive layoffs, bringing the labor market to a state where it is no longer a source of inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>A word on the critical importance of inflation expectations. Standard economic models have long reflected the view that inflation will return to its objective when product and labor markets are balanced&mdash;without the need for economic slack&mdash;so long as inflation expectations are anchored at our objective. That's what the models said, but the stability of longer-run inflation expectations since the 2000s had not been tested by a persistent burst of high inflation. It was far from assured that the inflation anchor would hold. Concerns over de-anchoring contributed to the view that disinflation would require slack in the economy and specifically in the labor market. An important takeaway from recent experience is that anchored inflation expectations, reinforced by vigorous central bank actions, can facilitate disinflation without the need for slack.</p>
<p>This narrative attributes much of the increase in inflation to an extraordinary collision between overheated and temporarily distorted demand and constrained supply. While researchers differ in their approaches and, to some extent, in their conclusions, a consensus seems to be emerging, which I see as attributing most of the rise in inflation to this collision.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20240823a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;All told, the healing from pandemic distortions, our efforts to moderate aggregate demand, and the anchoring of expectations have worked together to put inflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>Disinflation while preserving labor market strength is only possible with anchored inflation expectations, which reflect the public's confidence that the central bank will bring about 2 percent inflation over time. That confidence has been built over decades and reinforced by our actions.</p>
<p>That is my assessment of events. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />Let me wrap up by emphasizing that the pandemic economy has proved to be unlike any other, and that there remains much to be learned from this extraordinary period. Our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy emphasizes our commitment to reviewing our principles and making appropriate adjustments through a thorough public review every five years. As we begin this process later this year, we will be open to criticism and new ideas, while preserving the strengths of our framework. The limits of our knowledge&mdash;so clearly evident during the pandemic&mdash;demand humility and a questioning spirit focused on learning lessons from the past and applying them flexibly to our current challenges.</p>

<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. Shiller (1997) and Stantcheva (2024) study why people dislike inflation. Pfafjar and Winkler (2024) study households' attitudes toward inflation and unemployment. Binetti, Nuzzi, and Stantcheva (2024) investigate households' attitudes toward, and understanding of, inflation. Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017) and Jaravel (2021) document heterogeneity in the inflation rate experienced by households across the income distribution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The data for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is available for June 2024. Over the 12 months to June 2024, the PCE price index increased 2.5 percent. Data for the consumer price index and producer price index are available through July 2024 and can be used to estimate the level of the PCE price index through July. While such an estimate is subject to uncertainty, it suggests that inflation remained near 2.5 percent through July.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. Research documenting such benefits include Aaronson and others (2019), who discuss the experience in the 2010s and review related historical evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. Payroll employment grew by an average of 170,000 per month over the three months ending in July. On August 21, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the preliminary estimate of the upcoming annual benchmark revision to the establishment survey data, which will be issued in February 2025. The preliminary estimate indicates a downward adjustment to March 2024 total nonfarm employment of 818,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Early examples include Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and di Giovanni and others (2022). More recent work includes Benigno and Eggertsson (2023, 2024), Blanchard and Bernanke (2023, 2024), Crump and others (2024), Bai and others (2024), and Dao and others (forthcoming).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The Federal Reserve Board staff's estimate of the labor force makes two adjustments to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' published estimates: (i) reweighing Current Population Survey respondents such that the labor force estimates in all years reflect the Census Bureau's latest vintage of population estimates; and (ii) accounting for net immigration that is likely not fully reflected in the Census Bureau's latest population estimates, as detailed in the CBO's 2024 Demographic Outlook (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59899">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59899</a>). The pre-pandemic trend described here is calculated by appending the CBO's January 2020 projected labor force growth from the start of the pandemic through 2024:Q2 onto the level of the labor force just before the start of the pandemic. (See Congressional Budget Office (2020), The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56073">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56073</a>.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. For example, former Chair Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard summarize the standard approach in their work on inflation the following way: "Standard central banking doctrine holds that, so long as inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored, there is a case for 'looking through' temporary supply shocks rather than responding to the short-run increase in inflation" (Blanchard and Bernanke, 2024, p. 2). Clarida (forthcoming) notes how central banks around the world faced a sharp rise in the relative price of goods and chose, at least initially, to accommodate the price pressures with an expected transitory increase in inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. In the September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for headline inflation in 2022 was 2.2 percent. In the August 2021 Survey of Professional Forecasters (the closest survey to the September SEP), the median projection for headline inflation in 2022 was also 2.2 percent. Projections from the Blue Chip survey were similar around this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Beginning with the data for October, readings for monthly core PCE jumped to 0.4 percent or higher and inflationary pressures broadened out across goods and services categories. And monthly job gains, already strong, were consistently revised higher over the second half of 2021. Measures of wage inflation also accelerated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. For example, labor supply continued to be materially affected by COVID even after vaccines became broadly available in the U.S. By late 2021, anticipated increases in labor force participation had not yet materialized, likely owing, in part, to the rise of the Delta and Omicron COVID variants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. For example, in March 2022, lockdowns were imposed in the Jilin province, the largest center for auto production. Authorities also ramped up or extended restrictions in manufacturing hubs in the southeast and in Shanghai, where lockdowns had initially been scheduled to end in April 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. The global nature of this inflationary episode is emphasized in Cascaldi-Garcia and others (2024) and Clarida (forthcoming), among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. It has been argued that the natural rate of unemployment had risen, and that the unemployment rate was less informative about tightness in labor market than other measures such as those involving vacancies. For example, see Crump and others (2024). More generally, research has emphasized that the unemployment rate and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment often provide similar signals, but the signals differed in the pandemic period, and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment is a better overall indicator. For example, see Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and Benigno and Eggertsson (2023, 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. For example, Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022) and Cecchetti and others (2023) present analyses emphasizing that disinflation would require economic slack.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. Blanchard and Bernanke (2023) use a traditional (flexible) Phillips curve approach to reach this conclusion for the U.S. Blanchard and Bernanke (2024) and Dao and others (forthcoming) examine a broader set of countries using similar approaches. Di Giovanni and others (2022) and Bai and others (2024) use different techniques and emphasize supply constraints and shocks in the increase in inflation over 2021 and 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In tandem with the above Modifications, the Exchange has published amendments to its guidance materials that align the definition of a &ldquo;sophisticated investor&rdquo; for independent third party investment more closely with the Exchange&rsquo;s requirement for identifying qualified SIIs in Specialist Technology Companies<span>10</span>.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Marked-up changes to&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://en-rules.hkex.com.hk/sites/default/files/net_file_store/DOC_2.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Guide for New Listing Applicants</a></span></span>,&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://en-rules.hkex.com.hk/sites/default/files/net_file_store/gl113-22_markup.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the guidance letter HKEX-GL113-22</a></span></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://en-rules.hkex.com.hk/sites/default/files/net_file_store/faq-14.3_SPAC.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the frequently asked questions on SPACs</a></span></span>&nbsp;are available on the HKEX website.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span><span>Reasons for the Modifications</span></span></p>
<p><span>Specialist Technology Companies</span></p>
<p>The Modification recognises recent market conditions and intends to provide a viable listing pathway for new economy companies with high growth potential.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>De-SPAC Transactions</span></p>
<p>The purpose of requiring mandatory independent third party investment to complete a De-SPAC Transaction is to mitigate the risk of artificial valuation. The new minimum independent third party investment requirements will continue to represent a significant commitment of &ldquo;capital at risk&rdquo; to help ensure that there is support for the valuation of the De-SPAC Target in a De-SPAC Transaction.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Similar to the purpose of independent third party investment requirement for De-SPAC Transactions, the Chapter 18C Independence Test was designed to mitigate concerns related to difficulty in valuing Specialist Technology Companies. The new independence requirements for third party investors in De-SPAC Transactions are aligned with those of the Chapter 18C Independence Test for consistency and to address the difficulties experienced by SPACs in applying the independent financial adviser test<span>11</span>, which was formulated for a different purpose.</p>
</div>
<p class="spanHeading">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>The SFC has formally consented to the Modifications pursuant to&nbsp;</span><span>Main Board Listing Rule 2.04.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>A Specialist Technology Company is a company primarily engaged in the research and development of, and the commercialisation and/or sales of, products and/or services that apply science and/or technology within an acceptable sector of any of the specialist technology industries as set out in Chapter 2.5 of the Guide for New Listing Applicants. Chapter 18C of the Main Board Listing Rules provides a listing pathway for Specialist Technology Companies that cannot meet the eligibility requirements under Chapter 8 of the Main Board Listing Rules.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>A SPAC is a shell company that raises funds through its listing for the purpose of acquiring a business (a&nbsp;<span>De-SPAC Target</span>) at a later stage (a&nbsp;<span>De-SPAC Transaction</span>) within a pre-defined time period after listing. Chapter 18B of the Main Board Listing Rules provides a listing pathway for SPACs in Hong Kong and set out the requirements for De-SPAC Transactions.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>A Commercial Company is a Specialist Technology Company that has revenue of at least HK$250 million for its most recent audited financial year (<span>Commercialisation Revenue Threshold</span>).</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>A Pre-Commercial Company is a Specialist Technology Company that has not met the Commercialisation Revenue Threshold at the time of listing.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>A SPAC must demonstrate that the required minimum independent third party investment has been committed by the time of announcing the De-SPAC Transaction.</span></li>

<title>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Issues Its first Digitally Native Note (DNN) On Euroclear's D-FMI Platform</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Euroclear, AIIB, DNN, digital issuance, sustainable development bond<br />
<br />
AIIB partners with Euroclear, Citi, and BMO for the first USD digital issuance on Euroclear's D-FMI, marking a milestone in digital securities. Summary: Euroclear and AIIB partner with Citi and BMO for the first USD digital issuance on Euroclear's D-FMI, enabling broad adoption of digital bonds at scale. <div>
<p><span>Euroclear is pleased to announce that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has successfully issued its first Digitally Native Note, executed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euroclear.com/services/en/primary-issuance/digital-financial-market-infrastructure.html">Euroclear's Digital Financial Market Infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(D-FMI). This marks the first digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first such issuance by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. The initiative was supported by BMO Capital Markets as dealer and Citi, serving as dealer as well as the issuing and paying agent on the transaction.</span></p>
<p>The Digitally Native Note, boasting a triple A by Moody&rsquo;s, Standard and Poor&rsquo;s and Fitch Ratings, successfully raised USD 300 million to support AIIB&rsquo;s sustainable development bond programme.</p>
<p>The issuance was done via Euroclear&rsquo;s Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) service, which enables the issuance, distribution and settlement of fully digital international securities on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The note is listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Citi acted as a dealer as well as issuing and paying agent, BMO Capital Markets as a dealer, and Euroclear Bank as the issuer central securities depository. Clearing of the bonds is also possible on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority&rsquo;s Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) and SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX).</p>
<p>This DNN issuance further demonstrates the capabilities of Euroclear's digital securities issuance service to support market adoption of digital assets. With the objective to provide investors with sufficient liquidity tools and complete access to trading venues, Euroclear fully integrated the D-FMI platform with its traditional settlement system, ensuring CSDR compliance. Euroclear&rsquo;s D-SI service, launched in 2023, was recently recognised by Global Custodian magazine with the Market Infrastructure Project of the Year award.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euroclear.com/campaigns/en/biographies/Laurensy-Philippe.html">Philippe Laurensy</a>, Managing Director and Head of Product, Strategy and Innovation at Euroclear commented:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;As we continue our journey to becoming a digital, data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure, this issuance signifies another important step forward. Together with our clients and the wider ecosystem, we will continue to embrace innovation and deliver robust technology solutions that can unlock new business opportunities and attract issuers and investors from across the globe.&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;AIIB is proud to partner with Euroclear, Citi and BMO on this milestone transaction of many firsts. Not only is this the first USD digitally native note in Euroclear&rsquo;s D-FMI, it is also the first time an issuer based in Asia has issued on the platform and the first time a DNN could be held in CMU or SIX,&rdquo;&nbsp;</i>said AIIB Treasurer, Domenico Nardelli.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The success of this transaction proves Euroclear&rsquo;s D-FMI allows for easy and broad adoption of digital bonds at scale where market participants can buy and sell the bonds within their existing account structures. As a multilateral development bank financing Infrastructure for Tomorrow and with innovation in its DNA, AIIB sees this as an important opportunity to participate in the digitisation of capital markets and help connect Asia and the world.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>ASIC Wins Case Against Kraken Crypto Exchange Operator For Design And Distribution Failure</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-wins-case-against-kraken-crypto-exchange-operator-for-design-and-distributi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-wins-case-against-kraken-crypto-exchange-operator-for-design-and-distributi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Kraken, Bit Trade, Australia, margin trading, ASIC<br />
<br />Summary:<br />ASIC ruled that Bit Trade's margin trading product on Kraken did not comply with design and distribution obligations, failing to target market determination. Financial penalties will be sought. <div>
<p>The Federal Court today ruled Bit Trade Pty Ltd, the operator of the Kraken crypto exchange in Australia, failed to comply with design and distribution obligations when offering a margin trading product to Australian customers.</p>
<p>Since 5 October 2021, Bit Trade&rsquo;s &ldquo;margin extension&rdquo; product has been available to customers trading on the Kraken exchange without a target market determination, as required by law. As a result, Bit Trade contravened s994B(2) of the Corporations Act each time it made the product available to a customer.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This is a significant outcome for ASIC involving a major global crypto firm. We initiated proceedings to send a message to the crypto industry that we will continue to scrutinise products to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;s outcome sends a salient reminder to the crypto industry about the importance of compliance with the design and distribution obligations. It is a legal requirement for financial products to be distributed to consumers appropriately. Consumers should receive the full protection of the law when dealing in crypto-asset products and we will continue to take action to ensure this happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The product provided for margin extensions to be made and repaid in either digital assets (e.g. Bitcoin) or national currencies (e.g. US dollars). ASIC&rsquo;s case alleged that the obligation to repay a digital asset or national currency was a deferred debt and accordingly, that the product was a credit facility.</p>
<p>In handing down his judgment Justice Nicholas found the obligation to repay a digital asset was not an obligation to repay money and was therefore not a deferred debt.</p>
<p>However, his Honour agreed with ASIC that a margin extension in a national currency created a deferred debt which meant that the product was a credit facility.</p>
<p>ASIC and Bit Trade have been given seven days to agree on declarations and injunctions.&nbsp; ASIC will seek financial penalties against Bit Trade on a date to be set.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Bit Trade is registered with AUSTRAC. It is a subsidiary of Payward Incorporated. Bit Trade is the local operator of the Kraken crypto currency exchange.</p>
<p>Entities providing crypto-related products should be aware that many such products are financial products. ASIC Information Sheet 225: <em>Crypto Assets</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/" title="Crypto-assets">INFO 225</a>) provides guidance on the circumstances in which a crypto-related offering may be a financial product.</p>
<p>The design and distribution obligations (DDO) require firms to design financial products that meet the needs of consumers, and to distribute those products in a targeted manner. A target market determination is an important requirement under DDO. It is a mandatory public document that sets out the class of consumers a financial product is likely to be appropriate for (target market) and matters relevant to the product&rsquo;s distribution and review.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website has information for consumers about the risks of investing in &nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/cryptocurrencies">crypto-assets</a>.</p>

ASIC intervened 47 times to address greenwashing misconduct, including court proceedings, infringement notices, and corrective disclosure outcomes, promoting accurate and reliable information for investors and consumers.<br /><br />Summary: ASIC made 47 interventions to combat greenwashing, including court proceedings, infringement notices, and corrective disclosures to promote accurate information. They urge compliance with existing standards and new climate-related financial disclosure requirements. <div>
<p>ASIC has made 47 regulatory interventions to address greenwashing misconduct during the 15-month period up to 30 June 2024, including the commencement of two Federal Court proceedings and over $123,000 in infringement notice payments.</p>
<p>The range of interventions, outlined in Report 791&nbsp;<em>ASIC&rsquo;s interventions on greenwashing misconduct: 2023&ndash;2024</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-791-asic-s-interventions-on-greenwashing-misconduct-2023-2024/" title="REP 791 ASIC&rsquo;s interventions on greenwashing misconduct: 2023&ndash;2024">REP 791</a>), are aimed at stamping out misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to sustainable finance-related products and services.</p>
<p>The report also details findings, recommendations and good practice examples from its surveillance activities from 1 April 2023 to 30 June 2024.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said combating greenwashing is critical to maintaining trust in sustainable finance-related products and services.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Investors and consumers are entitled to accurate and reliable information so they can make informed and confident investment decisions. Greenwashing claims mislead investors and consumers, and undermines confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where we&rsquo;ve identified greenwashing misconduct, ASIC has intervened to protect investors and consumers, and to maintain market integrity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The interventions between 1 April 2023 and 30 June 2024 included:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtaining 37 corrective disclosure outcomes by various entities,</li>
<li>issuing eight infringement notices adding up to over $123,000, and</li>
<li>commencing civil penalty proceedings against LGSS Pty Limited (Active Super) (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-121mr-court-finds-active-super-made-misleading-esg-claims-in-a-greenwashing-action-brought-by-asic/" title="24-121MR Court finds Active Super made misleading ESG claims in a greenwashing action brought by ASIC">24-121MR</a>) and Vanguard Investments Australia (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-061mr-asic-wins-first-greenwashing-civil-penalty-action-against-vanguard/" title="24-061MR ASIC wins first greenwashing civil penalty action against Vanguard">24-061MR</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC also progressed the civil penalty proceeding against Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-173mr-asic-s-first-greenwashing-case-results-in-landmark-11-3-million-penalty-for-mercer/" title="24-173MR ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case results in landmark $11.3 million penalty for Mercer">24-173MR</a>), which concluded with an $11.3 million penalty.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory interventions related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>insufficient disclosure on the scope of ESG investment screens and investment methodologies,</li>
<li>underlying investments that are inconsistent with disclosed ESG investment screens and investment policies, and</li>
<li>sustainability-related claims made without reasonable grounds or without sufficient detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s greenwashing surveillance activities covered a broad range of sectors, including listed companies, managed funds, superannuation funds and the wholesale green bond market.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our surveillance indicates there is ample room for improvement and we strongly encourage product issuers and their advisers to focus on the quality of disclosures and the data underpinning them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sustainability-related information, like any other, should be accurate, based on reasonable grounds and be easily understood by investors,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>ASIC urges entities to consider the findings and recommendations in this report as well as Information Sheet 271&nbsp;<em>How to avoid greenwashing when offering or promoting sustainability-related products</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/how-to-avoid-greenwashing-when-offering-or-promoting-sustainability-related-products/" title="How to avoid greenwashing when offering or promoting sustainability-related products">INFO 271</a>) and Report 763&nbsp;<em>ASIC&rsquo;s recent greenwashing interventions</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-763-asic-s-recent-greenwashing-interventions/" title="REP 763 ASIC&rsquo;s recent greenwashing interventions">REP 763</a>) to reduce the risk of greenwashing.</p>
<p>ASIC acknowledges the significant changes ahead with the proposed introduction of mandatory climate-related financial disclosure requirements for large businesses and financial institutions. The Bill proposing this legislation has now passed the Senate. Once it receives Royal Assent, information will be made available on the ASIC website.</p>
<p>ASIC will take a pragmatic and proportionate approach to the supervision and enforcement of this new regime. We will engage closely with industry as we develop appropriate guidance to help it build the capability required to meet the new obligations.</p>
<p>Throughout the transition to the proposed mandatory climate reporting regime, ASIC will act to ensure current disclosure and governance standards are maintained and that entities comply with their existing legal obligations, including the longstanding prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Greenwashing and sustainable finance are key priorities for ASIC as outlined in our Corporate Plan. ASIC is focusing on supporting market integrity and efficiency through the supervision and enforcement of current governance and disclosure standards to reduce harms from greenwashing, while engaging closely on climate-related financial disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s INFO 271, which was issued in June 2022, sets out a number of questions for financial product issuers to consider when preparing communications and disclosures about sustainability-related products.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of Justice: Former Energy Trader For Vitol Inc. Pleads Guilty To International Bribery Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> bribery, Vitol Inc., PEMEX, guilty plea, money laundering <br />
Summary:<br />
Former Vitol Inc. energy trader pleaded guilty to bribing Mexican officials and faces up to 20 years in prison. Seven co-conspirators also pleaded guilty. <div>
<p>A former energy trader pleaded guilty yesterday for his role in a scheme to bribe Mexican government officials to secure contracts for his then-employer, Vitol Inc. (Vitol), the U.S.&nbsp;affiliate of the largest independent energy trading firm in the world.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Javier Aguilar, 50, of Houston, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PEMEX Procurement International, Inc. (PPI), a wholly owned affiliate of the Mexican state-owned oil company, Petr&oacute;leos Mexicanos (PEMEX), in exchange for assistance in winning business for Vitol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Javier Aguilar has now admitted that he bribed foreign officials to win business when he worked as an oil and gas trader at Vitol Inc., using shell companies, fake contracts, sham invoices, and alias email accounts,&rdquo; said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Aguilar&rsquo;s guilty plea yesterday follows his conviction at trial on related charges earlier this year. His illegal conduct netted Vitol hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, and now he will pay the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With yesterday's guilty plea, the defendant admits his role in the widespread corruption of the international commodities market and to casting aside laws and rules that apply to all to unfairly line the pockets of the few,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. &ldquo;The actions of the defendant and his co-conspirators, and of those who act similarly, destroy people&rsquo;s faith in their governments, disadvantage those who play by the rules, undermine confidence in American businesses worldwide, and will not be tolerated by this Office or our law enforcement partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Southern District of Texas is ground zero in the fight against foreign bribery and corruption in Latin America,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. &ldquo;My office&rsquo;s prosecutors &mdash; experts on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act &mdash; will continue to bring to justice those who damage the integrity of Texas&rsquo;s vital energy sector with illegal advantages fueled by greed. This guilty plea begins the process of repairing the damage caused by Aguilar as well as putting on notice those who might seek to emulate him and his cohorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been the law of the land, and enforceable worldwide, for decades. Yet unscrupulous businessmen still try to bribe their way to profit,&rdquo; said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. &ldquo;My message to them is that the charges and penalties you will face are not worth the gain. I want to commend the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Office of International Affairs; the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of New York; and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of Texas for their diligence pursuing this case, but especially the agents and analysts who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of FCPA violators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2020, Aguilar, who was a trader in Vitol&rsquo;s Houston office, and his co-conspirators paid approximately $600,000 in bribes to two senior officials at PPI to obtain numerous contracts for Vitol to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of ethane to PEMEX. To conceal the scheme, Aguilar and his co-conspirators used a series of fake contracts, sham invoices and shell entities incorporated in Cura&ccedil;ao and Mexico. The defendant and his co-conspirators also used alias email accounts to communicate about the scheme and code words, including &ldquo;shoes,&rdquo; &ldquo;medicine,&rdquo; &ldquo;invitations,&rdquo; and &ldquo;coffee,&rdquo; to describe the bribes.</p>
<p>Aguilar pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to a violation of the Travel Act. The FCPA conspiracy charge, which was brought by a grand jury in the Southern District of Texas, related to conduct that was initially charged in the Eastern District of New York. As part of his guilty plea, Aguilar consented to transfer the Texas case to New York, to consolidate the cases, and to forfeit $7,129,938. The plea follows Aguilar&rsquo;s related&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-oil-and-gas-trader-convicted-role-foreign-bribery-and-money-laundering-scheme">conviction</a>&nbsp;at trial in February 2024 for conspiracy to violate the FCPA, violating the FCPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with schemes to bribe Ecuadorian and Mexican officials. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years&rsquo; imprisonment on the money laundering offense and five years&rsquo; imprisonment on each of the other offenses. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.</p>
<p>In December 2020, Vitol&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/vitol-inc-agrees-pay-over-135-million-resolve-foreign-bribery-case">admitted</a>&nbsp;to bribing officials in Ecuador, Mexico, and Brazil in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Vitol entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section and the U.S.&nbsp;Attorney&rsquo;s Office of the Eastern District of New York. As a part of the resolution, Vitol agreed to pay a combined $135 million in penalties as part of a coordinated resolution with the Department of Justice, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and authorities in Brazil.</p>
<p>Seven of the defendant&rsquo;s co-conspirators have pleaded guilty for their role in the scheme and are awaiting sentencing. These individuals have agreed to forfeit more than $63&nbsp;million in connection with this and related schemes.</p>
<p>FBI Miami&rsquo;s International Corruption Squad investigated the case.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jonathan P. Lax, Matthew R. Galeotti, and Nick M. Axelrod for the Eastern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sherin Daniel and Deputy Chief Suzanne Elmilady for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The MLARS Special Financial Investigations Unit and Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA and Foreign Extortion Prevention Act matters. Additional information about the Justice Department&rsquo;s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa">www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa</a>.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov">kleptocracy@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">https://tips.fbi.gov/</a>.</p>

The investment will drive a multi-product roadmap, including the expansion of its AI and Machine Learning capabilities, and strengthen strategic partnerships. These initiatives will help support the accelerated capital flows, and eliminate inconsistent data and processes seen across the Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) and private credit ecosystem.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Since its founding in 2012, Siepe has designed solutions and services that enable strategic business and investment decisions for the front, middle and back office teams of private credit asset managers and CLOs. Their solution suite brings entire investment lifecycles into perspective, providing customers with a single source of truth and full transparency into real-time, accurate data to increase oversight and streamline workflows. By leveraging AI technology, Siepe solutions also eliminate manual processes that can be used to drive bottom-line growth for its clients&rsquo; customers and optimize investments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As private credit continues to be one of the fastest growing asset classes within the alternatives market, the firm is committed to enhancing the efficiency, data integrity, compliance support and scalability of CLO and private credit managers. As a result, Siepe has seen significant growth across technology and service business lines in H1 2024 with private credit managers. This includes adding nineteen CLO and private credit deals with eight top-tier US CLO managers, which accounts for over $7.7BN in new assets under administration (AUA). The Company also onboarded two new front-office software clients, one with $80BN AUM in private credit assets and the other with $6BN in total AUM and launched a new private credit fund.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;The growth of private credit markets has outpaced investment in technology and innovation, causing inefficiency, lack of insight and control over private assets,&rdquo; said Laurence A. Tosi, Managing Partner and Founder of WestCap. &ldquo;These are the challenges that Siepe is addressing with a trusted solution that brings the entire investment lifecycle into perspective.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In conjunction with the new funding, Siepe has appointed Mark Schultis as President.

<title>OCC Announces Enforcement Actions For August 2024</title>

<div> enforcement actions, national banks, unsafe practices, orders of prohibition, termination actions
Summary:
The OCC released enforcement actions and termination actions against national banks and individuals for unsafe practices, including theft and unauthorized transactions. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-CE-2024-27.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with 1st National Bank</span>, Lebanon, Ohio, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, capital planning, liquidity risk management, and interest rate risk management. (Docket No. AA-CE-2024-27).</li>
<li><span><a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-NE-2024-68.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Generations Bank</span>, Seneca Falls, New York, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board oversight, strategic planning, liquidity risk management, and interest rate risk management. (Docket No. AA-NE-2024-68).</li>
<li><span><a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-NE-2024-71.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Maple City Savings Bank, FSB</span>, Hornell, New York, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board oversight and corporate governance, strategic and capital planning, liquidity risk management, and interest rate risk management, and a violation relating to transactions with affiliates. (Docket No. AA-NE-2024-71).</li>
<li><span><a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-CE-2024-65.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Slovenian S&amp;LA of Franklin-Conemaugh</span>, Conemaugh, Pennsylvania, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, succession planning, balance sheet management, internal audit, and the bank&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) internal controls, audit, and training, and violations of 12 CFR 21.21 (BSA/AML compliance program) and 31 CFR 1020.210 (Customer Due Diligence). (Docket No. AA-CE-2024-65).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-54N.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Notice of Charges</a>&nbsp;for Order of Prohibition against Roberto A. Garcia</span>, former Personal Banker at a North Miami, Florida, branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio.

Summary:
The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group achieved record-high revenue and EBITDA, with decreased net profit. It also focused on developing products and educational initiatives.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group generated record-high sales revenue of PLN 120.9 million in Q2 2024, a year-on-year increase of 9.2%. The Group&rsquo;s EBITDA in Q2 adjusted for a one-off event<span>[1]</span>&nbsp;increased by 8.0% YoY to PLN 47.5 million, while adjusted net profit<span>[2]</span>&nbsp;decreased by 1.1% YoY to PLN 44.5 million.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Record-high revenue</span></h4>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group (GPW Group) generated a record-high sales revenue of PLN 239.1 million in H1 2024, a year-on-year increase of 7.2%. EBITDA adjusted for a one-off increased 0.6% year on year to PLN 79.3 million, while net profit attributable to owners of the parent entity decreased by 6.5% year on year to PLN 66.9 million.</p>
<p>In Q2 2024 alone, the Group&rsquo;s revenue reached PLN 120.9 million, up 9.2% YoY. Revenue from the financial market increased by 16.8% YoY to PLN 76.9 million while the commodity market saw a decrease in revenue by 0.6% YoY to PLN 39.5 million. Revenue from information services on the financial and commodity markets increased by 12.7% to PLN 17.6 million.</p>
<p>The Group&rsquo;s operating expenses increased by 6.4% YoY to PLN 79.9 million in Q2 2024. The deceleration in the growth rate of costs was mainly due to a reduction of external service charges by almost 11% year on year, which are under tight control.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The growth rate of revenue was higher than the growth rate of costs for the first time in 11 quarters. It is the Management Board&rsquo;s priority to ensure a steady decrease of the cost/income ratio, which we want to achieve first and foremost by improving cost discipline. Our benchmark is the cost/income ratio reported in 2011-2021, when C/I never exceeded 60%,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The GPW Group&rsquo;s EBITDA amounted to PLN 41.7 million in Q2 2024, down 5.3% year on year. EBITDA adjusted for the one-off event increased by 8,0% YoY to PLN 47.5 million. Net profit attributable to owners of the parent entity decreased by 11.6% YoY to PLN 39.8 million in Q2 2024. Net profit adjusted for the one-off event was PLN 44.5 million, down 1.1% year on year. This was due to a PLN 6.2 million YoY decrease in net financial income caused by a drop in market interest rates and an increase in provisions for potential VAT liabilities at IRGiT.</p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange paid shareholders a dividend of PLN 125.9 million in August, the third highest dividend in the history of GPW. The dividend paid at PLN 3.0 per share represented 79.9% of the GPW Group&rsquo;s consolidated net profit for 2023. The dividend yield at the closing price on the dividend record date was 6.85%.</p>
<h4><span>Cash market records</span></h4>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange remained a leading European market in Q2 2024. According to the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), GPW recorded one of the highest increases in EOB equity trading in Europe, up by 43.9% year on year. Main Market EOB turnover reached PLN 88.4 billion, the highest figure in more than two years. GPW ranked a high third in Europe by velocity of 40.3%. The average daily EOB equity turnover value amounted to PLN 1.45 billion in Q2 2024, an increase of 34.7% year on year.</p>
<p>GPW&rsquo;s Main Market EOB equity turnover value was record-high throughout H1 2024. With turnover at PLN 171.1 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 27.3%, it was the best first six months of the year in the history of GPW and the best six-month period overall. Investor activity also remained strong in July: GPW&rsquo;s total Main Market EOB equity turnover value amounted to PLN 23.7 billion, an increase of 22.5% year on year.</p>
<h4><span>Developing the product range</span></h4>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange is always expanding its range of financial instruments to better meet the diverse needs of individual investors. GPW aims to provide investors with access to a broad range of investment strategies. Tracker certificates based on the DAX Net Return index issued by ING Bank N.V. were added to the offer in Q2 2024. These are the first Tracker certificates from this issuer available on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Moreover, new Turbo structured certificates introduced at the end of May are based on the stock of six of the largest and most globally recognised brands listed on the US stock market: Berkshire Hathaway, Booking.com, Coca-Cola, Exxon Mobil, Spotify, and Super Micro Computer.</p>
<p>New Tracker structured certificates based on the EURO STOXX 50 Net Return and STOXX Europe 600 Oil &amp; Gas Net Return indices are available on the Warsaw Stock Exchange as of July 2024. Furthermore, stocks of nine new US companies were introduced to the GlobalConnect market in July, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, JP Morgan Chase, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and Visa. These stocks are listed on the Nasdaq and NYSE in New York and are part of the S&amp;P 500 index, one of the largest stock market indices in the world.</p>
<h4><span>New trading system&rsquo;s go-live date</span></h4>
<p>GPW is continuing work on its proprietary trading system GPW WATS (Warsaw Automated Trading System). At the end of July, the GPW Management Board set the new system&rsquo;s go-live date for 10 November 2025. The decision was taken in line with the recommendation of the GPW WATS Implementation Committee which plays a key role in overseeing and coordinating all aspects of the implementation of the new system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The GPW WATS trading system will bring major technological and operational benefits to the entire GPW Group. It will largely improve the quality and efficiency of stock exchange operations by offering advanced functions and enhancing the security and reliability of transactions. That is why it was instrumental to set a go-live date in order to effectively plan next steps on the part of GPW and other market participants,</em>&rdquo; said Sławomir Panasiuk, Vice-President of the GPW Management Board.</p>
<h4><span>Educational initiatives</span></h4>
<p>The implementation of the educational mission and the improvement of knowledge of the capital and financial market are among the top priorities of the GPW Management Board. Initiatives taken through the GPW Foundation are addressed to a wide audience, including school students and teachers, university students, adults, seniors, investors and entrepreneurs. Through multiple partnerships with educational and economic organisations, the GPW Foundation runs projects which not only broaden theoretical knowledge but also develop practical skills in investing, saving and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The GPW Foundation aims to promote a culture of informed long-term investment in the capital markets through financial education and initiatives which support investors. We aspire to make shares and financial instruments listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange an integral part of household assets. More than 100,000 beneficiaries participated in the GPW Foundation&rsquo;s educational initiatives in H1 2024, which highlights its key role in promoting financial and investment knowledge in Poland. Even during the summer holiday season, when many people enjoy leisure time, GPW&rsquo;s first-ever &lsquo;Holidays on the Stock Exchange&rsquo; competition attracted nearly 6,000 participants who wanted to learn how to invest on the stock market,</em>&rdquo; said Monika Gorgoń, Member of the GPW Management Board.</p>
<p>The initiatives aimed at school students and teachers include the Online School Exchange Game (SIGG), Poland&rsquo;s largest educational project dedicated to the capital market. The record-breaking 23<span>rd</span>&nbsp;edition in the 2023/2024 school year attracted nearly 30,000 school students and more than 1,000 teachers from all over Poland. Since the launch of the programme more than two decades ago, it has attracted an impressive 380,000 participants.</p>

<div> Delinquency rate, serious delinquencies, prepayment activity, foreclosure starts, foreclosure sales
<br />
Summary:<br /> The national delinquency rate fell in July, except in Houston due to Hurricane Beryl. Serious delinquencies and prepayment activity rose. Foreclosure starts and sales increased. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The national delinquency rate fell 12 basis points (bps) to 3.37% in July, offsetting some of June&rsquo;s calendar-related rise &ndash; dropping 3.5% for the month but up 4.8% from the same time last year</li>
<li>Delinquencies declined in all major markets except Houston, where Hurricane Beryl resulted in an estimated 10K mortgage holders falling behind on payments as a result of the storm</li>
<li>Serious delinquencies (loans 90+ days past due but not in active foreclosure) rose 5K (+1.1%) to a five-month high, but are still down -33K (-7.0%) from the same time last year</li>
<li>The number of borrowers a single payment past due dropped by -77K in July, while 60-day delinquencies climbed 11K</li>
<li>While foreclosure starts increased by 7K (30%) in the month, that&rsquo;s partially a byproduct of starts hitting a multi-year low the month prior rather than a sign of underlying stress in the market</li>
<li>Active foreclosure inventory nudged higher (+2K), but remains at its second-lowest level since January 2022 and is still 34% below pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>5.5K foreclosure sales were completed in July representing a +3.7% month-over-month increase, but were down -9.6% from last year and are still running at less than half their 2019 averages</li>
<li>Prepayment activity (SMM) rose to 0.60% on easing rates, notching its highest mark since September 2022</li>
</ul>

<title>Global Asset Managers Divided Over The FCA’s Unbundling Rules</title>

<div> asset managers, FCA unbundling rules, global survey, market reaction, research funding<br />
Summary: The survey on FCA unbundling rules shows a split market, with potential early adopters, a "wait and see" group, and sceptics. Changes to FCA rules have influenced asset managers' attitudes, with relaxation of rules around strategy level budgets being the most important change. The market is split on how fast the new rules will be adopted. Uncertainty stems from conversations with end investors as asset managers are reluctant to open up the fees discussion.<br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Substantive Research surveys global asset managers on FCA unbundling rules, published in July 2024</span></li>
<li><span>Survey shows that the market is split between a core of potential early adopters, a large &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; group and an entrenched group of sceptics</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Substantive Research,&nbsp; the research and market data discovery and spend analytics provider, published the findings of its latest global asset management survey today, evaluating the industry's reaction to the FCA&rsquo;s unbundling rules, which came into force on 1st August 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For context, after the FCA published its Consultation Paper on &ldquo;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fconsultation%2Fcp24-7.pdf/1/0102019179bedf7c-35531fa3-ef42-419a-8054-c389cd6c0da8-000000/hd_FUpyXnjX70QYlAdLJtK0lkWM=388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Payment Optionality for Investment</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Research</span></a><span>&rdquo; (CP 24/7) in April 2024, the industry came back to the FCA with very clear concerns and requests, and the final&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fpolicy%2Fps24-9.pdf/2/0102019179bedf7c-35531fa3-ef42-419a-8054-c389cd6c0da8-000000/GbSk0Zn2cSdqQlHgW8FpDe4LrfU=388" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Policy Statement</span></a><span>&nbsp;(24/9) shows that the regulators have listened.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The aim of the Substantive Research survey was to gauge asset managers&rsquo; reaction to the final rules and to see whether the FCA&rsquo;s changes to their initial proposals will change the industry response. Key findings compare how the buy side feels now with the final rules in place, versus the reaction to the Consultation Paper in April.</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, the survey confirms that the changes the FCA has made between the Consultation Paper and the final rules have eliminated some deal breakers for the more engaged firms keen to proceed. The FCA has removed key operational barriers that were hampering the potential take-up of greater flexibility in research funding, and there is a group of asset managers gearing up to test market reaction, save money and potentially increase their access to research inputs. But an equal number of buy side sceptics point to a scenario where asset owners scupper any real momentum shifts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>The group of managers who are &ldquo;Neutral and waiting to see how the rest of the market moves&rdquo; has grown slightly to 45% of respondents, up from 42%.</span> </li>
<li> <span>The potential early-adopter group who are &ldquo;Broadly interested but not a first mover&rdquo; has doubled to 18.2%, up from 9.1%.</span>&lt; </li>
<li> <span>Accordingly, the proportion of those &ldquo;interested but put off by the detail of the FCA guardrails&rdquo; (on budgeting, disclosure, cost allocation and valuation) has shrunk by 9%, down to 9.1%.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, more than a quarter of firms do not intend to move budgets and are sceptical that this will gain traction with peers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>18.2% position themselves as &ldquo;Sceptical and not engaged&rdquo; and&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>9.1% are &ldquo;Not interested in moving.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><!-- </li--> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Many of these firms don&rsquo;t think these changes would spur further coverage on UK SMEs, and regard the unbundling rollback as an unwelcome distraction, now that they finally have their post-MiFID II processes in place and working well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;The changes in asset managers&rsquo; attitudes are driven by changes in the FCA&rsquo;s final rules when compared to the initial consultation. It&rsquo;s clear that the biggest sticking point was the impression that the Consultation Paper was mandating strategy-level research budgets. This is something that many firms are loath to do, as they share research across the firm and would find allocating that spend at a granular level problematic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4><span>Our survey shows that:</span></h4>
<ul>
<li> <span>60% of respondents cited &ldquo;Relaxation of the rules around strategy level budgets&rdquo; as the most important change, followed by</span> </li>
<li> <span>18.2% said the most important change was &ldquo;Removing the requirement for buy side firms to have separate written agreements with providers.&rdquo;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Carrodus added:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are now faced with two sets of firms with completely opposing views, both representing approximately a fifth of the market, and nearly half of the buy side on a &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo; mode.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The market is also split when it comes to expectations on how fast the new rules will be adopted:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>The group of firms that expect no change within 2 years has grown by 7%, up to 42.4%.&nbsp;</span>&lt; </li>
<li> In contrast, within the same 2 year timeframe, 15.2% think that the majority of research budgets will be client-funded, with a significant 42.4% expecting that there will be a &ldquo;broadly equal mix of client-funded and P&amp;L&rdquo; budgets by then.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Carrodus concluded:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;The source of this uncertainty is the conversation with the end investor. The FCA has clarified that it only needs asset owners to be informed of the new policies and changes if asset managers do move to &ldquo;joint payments&rdquo;, so explicit consent is not required. However, many senior executives on the buy side do not want to open up the fees discussion during such a challenging time for asset gathering and retention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;As these are new costs being reintroduced after 6 years of asset managers paying for them out of their own pockets, they anticipate pushback from clients and do not want to have to try and figure out what to do if a handful of clients object and opt out of paying while the rest acquiesce.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Brokers and independent research providers may target a more lucrative future after years of price deflation, but we&rsquo;ll only know if those hopes are well founded when the first canaries venture down the coalmine this winter!&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>Universe of respondents:&nbsp;</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>33 of the largest asset managers surveyed</span><br /> <span>Total AUM: &gt; $11 Trillion&nbsp;</span><br /> <span>Geographic split by headquarters: 36% N. America, 12% EU, 52% UK</span><br /> <span>Strategy: Long Only 79%, Hedge Fund 12%, Wealth Manager 9%</span></p>

<title>SIX Launches New Flag To Help Identify Paris Agreement Aligned Equities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> flag, companies, 1.5°C, requirements, sustainability

Summary: SIX introduces a '1.5°C Climate Equity' flag for companies aligned with Paris Agreement, with requirements confirmed by approved reviewers. <div>
<p class="lead">SIX has introduced the new &lsquo;SIX 1.5 &deg;C Climate Equity&rsquo; flag to help investors identify companies whose existing business models and future plans are aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Whether a company meets the relevant requirements must be confirmed by an approved reviewer. Companies listed on SIX Swiss Exchange can apply for the voluntary flag from today.</p>
<div></div>
<div class="fig"></div>
<div class="textimage ">
<div>
<div>
<p>To earn the flag, a company must provide SIX with a confirmation from an approved reviewer that it meets all flag requirements. Currently, two approved reviewers are available: S&amp;P and SGS. The flag is valid for one year and must be renewed annually with an updated confirmation.</p>
<p>The requirements for the confirmation consist of three assessments. The first is a top-down analysis of whether the company's entire value chain aligns with the 1.5&deg;C goal, by examining its future emissions reduction and removal targets. The second evaluates bottom-up whether it is credible that the company will continue to meet its targets. The third is an activity-level assessment that determines whether over 50% of the company&rsquo;s current revenues and investments contribute towards the 1.5&deg;C goal.</p>
<p>SIX has defined these criteria based on established sustainability principles and the scientific consensus on climate science according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Herewith, the emerging accordance among widely used methodologies and standards are reflected. These mainly include the Carbon Disclosure Project Assessing Low-Carbon Transition initiative (CDP ACT initiative), the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), the UN Race to Zero Starting Line Criteria, and the WFE Green Equity Principles (2023). SIX continuously observes developments in this field and will refine its framework as necessary to ensure it remains current and effective.</p>
<p>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, Global Head Exchanges and Executive Board Member, SIX, highlights: &ldquo;Our new flag serves as a tool to enhance the visibility and reputation of companies. This in turn supports investors in making more informed decisions, reducing uncertainty around a company&rsquo;s current and future climate emissions trajectory. We developed the concept for the flag following extensive exchange with listed companies, audit and legal firms, sustainability experts as well as industry associations and it represents a further step in our sustainability strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ASIC Expands Strategic Priorities For Coming 12 Months</title>

<div> markets, integrity, transparency, private markets, strategic priorities
Summary:<br />ASIC’s new strategic priorities focus on strengthening integrity and transparency in Australia’s public and private markets, guiding resource deployment and enhancing market consistency. <br /> <div>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets and emerging financial products will form a new pillar of ASIC&rsquo;s expanded strategic priorities.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the agency&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/corporate-publications/asic-corporate-plan/" title="ASIC Corporate Plan">Corporate Plan</a>&nbsp;included a new pillar in its strategic priorities that underscored a commitment to strengthening integrity across Australia&rsquo;s markets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The integrity of our markets is fundamental to maintaining trust in Australia&rsquo;s financial system which is core to ASIC&rsquo;s remit,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trust in the financial system and markets means greater confidence which means more investment. That has direct benefits for the jobs and opportunities of Australians.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While Australia&rsquo;s private markets are dwarfed in size by our listed equity markets, their opacity presents an outsized risk to market integrity, particularly as more investors become exposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The addition of a new strategic priority aimed at driving consistency and transparency across markets and products puts all market participants on notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Longo said the transformation work that had been underway at ASIC over the past three years had helped the agency to review and clarify its focus areas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While the overarching themes of our existing strategic priorities remain consistent, our updated Corporate Plan demonstrate how we are evolving and adapting to the changing needs of our operating environment,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the agency embeds the new structure we implemented last year, we are better able to anticipate and respond to threats and opportunities.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The new structure and our strategic priorities are also helping better guide decisions about how to deploy ASIC&rsquo;s limited resources.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the last year alone we commenced around 170 new investigations - an increase of about 25%, and we filed 33 new civil proceedings in the Federal Court - an increase of 27% in civil proceedings on the previous year. Our investigations have led to 18 criminal convictions and seen a further 23 individuals charged by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution for criminal offences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our latest Corporate Plan and strategic priorities represent the next step of ASIC&rsquo;s transformation journey to being a modern, confident and ambitious regulator.&rsquo;</p>

<div> capital markets, Hong Kong, AUM, licensing, virtual assets<br />
Summary: The Hong Kong capital markets showed growth in AUM and fund inflows, increased licensing applications, and listed virtual asset ETFs. The SFC also focused on investor protection. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Hong Kong capital markets made encouraging, broad-based progress in the second quarter of 2024 as reflected by an array of data on asset management, listing, licensing and virtual assets, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/QR-Reports/202404-08/0-SFC-Quartelry-Report-AprJun-2024ENG.pdf?rev=d75b9722329e4bc2b3f393296d77f72b" target="_blank">Quarterly Report</a>&nbsp;of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published today.</p>
<p>Among the notable developments for the quarter covering April-June, Hong Kong-domiciled funds showed continued momentum with assets under management (AUM) up 7% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) as of end-June and net fund inflows up 80% QoQ for the quarter (Note 1).</p>
<p>Another bright spot was the growth of licence applications received by the SFC, which rose 3% QoQ and 8% year-on-year. New listing applications the SFC cleared also increased 6% QoQ (Note 2).</p>
<p>On the virtual assets (VA) front, Asia&rsquo;s first batch of six VA spot ETFs listed in Hong Kong have traded smoothly with a total market capitalisation of $2.4 billion (US$310 million) as of mid-August. In addition, the SFC received 17 applications for virtual asset trading platform (VATP) licences in the quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latest quarterly data and continuing trends reaffirm the SFC&rsquo;s strategic approach, and we will build upon our accomplishments with steadfast commitment to market connectivity, innovation, sustainability and, above all, integrity,&rdquo; said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;Going forward, the SFC will continue with its assiduous efforts to ensure Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets remain competitive and resilient against global headwinds, evolving trends and unforeseen challenges ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To ensure Hong Kong markets remain competitive internationally, the SFC participated in formulating a proposal to maintain normal market trading and other operations under severe weather, which Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) will put into effect in late September. It has also been working closely with HKEX to strengthen the listing market through the introduction of treasury shares regime and review of the corporate governance framework.</p>
<p>On investor protection and combatting misconduct, the SFC secured the conviction of three individuals involved in a highly sophisticated market manipulation scheme following a landmark High Court jury trial. Also, the regulator disciplined five individuals in the quarter, suspending their licences or prohibiting them from entering the industry for seven months to four years. To keep the public scam-savvy and caution investors against suspicious activities, the SFC added nine entities as well as four investment products onto its alert lists last quarter. It also launched a TV commercial and radio advertising campaign to raise anti-investment scam awareness and joined other local financial regulators in April to support the Anti-Scam Consumer Protection Charter 2.0 to assist the public in guarding against investment scams and digital frauds (Note 4).</p>
<p>The quarterly report is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Published-resources/Corporate-publications/Quarterly-report" target="_blank">SFC website</a>.<br /><br />End</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>For asset management, the AUM and net fund inflows of Hong Kong-domiciled funds increased QoQ to $1,492.4 billion (US$191.1 billion) and $59.1 billion (US$7.6 billion) respectively.</li>
<li>During the quarter, the SFC received 1,931 licence applications, and the number of new licensees and registrants totalled 2,593. Moreover, it cleared 53 new listing applications.</li>
<li>Other measures include mutual recognition of funds enhancements, incorporating real estate investment trusts into Stock Connect, the inclusion of renminbi-denominated stocks into southbound Stock Connect, and the listing of leading Mainland companies in Hong Kong.</li>
<li>Over 100 SFC-licensed corporations, covering more than 80% of all active clients, have signed up the charter.</li>

Summary: The High Court orders Peter Harris to pay $1.4 million for continuous disclosure breaches in CBL Corporation, settling with FMA. Harris also offered an Enforceable Undertaking.<br /> <div>

<li>the need for its primary operating subsidiary, CBL Insurance Limited (In Liquidation), to strengthen its reserves;</li>
<li>the existence and impact of a large amount of aged receivables (insurance premiums owed but not paid) in respect of business originated by Securities and Financial Solutions Europe SA, a French insurance business; and</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>CBLC engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in respect of its market announcement on 24 August 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March 2024, the FMA and Mr Harris entered into an in-court settlement to resolve the Continuous Disclosure Proceeding on terms acceptable to both parties. That included Mr Harris making admissions to seven contraventions of the FMCA, and jointly agreeing to support the penalty that the Court has now approved. A penalty hearing for Mr Harris was held on 10 June 2024.</p>
<p>In his decision, released this week, Justice Gault declared Mr Harris breached the fair dealing and continuous disclosure provisions under sections 22 and 270 of the FMCA and imposed the pecuniary penalty.</p>
<p>In doing so, Justice Gault said: &ldquo;[t]he present case is the epitome of what the fair dealing provisions and continuous disclosure regime are designed to prevent. Such breaches undermine market integrity and transparency. They are unfair to investors, and jeopardise confidence in the integrity and transparency of New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets. Any penalty must bear in mind such harmful effects. The contraventions denied investors access to accurate and timely information, and are inconsistent with the promotion of transparent financial markets. Investors were provided with misleading information in August 2017 and no further information was made available to them about the multiple material issues impacting CBLC&rsquo;s business until 5 February 2018, after the trading halt. The conduct was completely inconsistent with promoting the confident and informed participation of business, investors and consumers in New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice Gault added: &ldquo;More generally, as Managing Director, Mr Harris was integral to the overall direction and management of the CBL Group, and had a detailed knowledge and understanding of the matters that are the subject of the contraventions,&rdquo; and that he &ldquo;was not only Managing Director but also a member of the Disclosure Committee tasked with determining information required to be disclosed to the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, said: &ldquo;The level of penalty reflects the seriousness of the breaches that occurred in this case and Mr Harris&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities as CEO and Managing Director entrusted with the governance of a listed company. As the Court states, disclosure is a fundamental obligation which ensures New Zealand&rsquo;s listed capital markets are efficient, transparent and fair, and that there is equality of information in the market. Mr Harris&rsquo;s actions fell well below the requirements of the FMCA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of his settlement with FMA in March 2024, Mr Harris also offered, and the FMA agreed, to an Enforceable Undertaking that he will not hold any management or directorship positions with any listed issuer or licenced insurer in New Zealand and will not participate in any regulated offer in New Zealand. The duration of this undertaking is until the final determination by the courts of the relief sought by the FMA in its separate proceeding alleging failures in disclosure during CBLC&rsquo;s initial public offering in 2015 (the IPO Proceeding) (including any appeals).</p>
<p><span>Background</span></p>
<p>The FMA filed two proceedings in 2019 alleging breaches of the FMCA, namely the Continuous Disclosure Proceeding and the IPO Proceeding.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Court made pecuniary penalty orders against CBLC and its four former independent directors in the Continuous Disclosure Proceeding after they admitted continuous disclosure and misleading conduct breaches. The hearing of the Continuous Disclosure Proceeding against former CBLC chief financial officer Carden Mulholland, commenced in late June 2024 and concluded at the beginning of this month. The parties await the decision of the Court.</p>
<p>The IPO Proceeding was brought against CBLC, Mr Harris, Mr Mulholland and the estate of former non-executive director Alistair Hutchison*. The hearing of the IPO Proceeding is set down for April 2026.</p>
<p>The defendants have settled separate civil proceedings brought by shareholders and liquidators for a sum of $72.5 million, which includes a personal contribution by Mr Harris. Approximately 53% of that settlement sum has been or will be paid to CBLC shareholders who participated in those proceedings. The settlement was entered into without any admission of liability by the defendants and the sum is payable on behalf of CBLC and all of CBLC&rsquo;s directors.</p>
<p>CBLC was listed on the NZX Main Board in 2015. It had a market capitalisation of $747 million, and a share price of $3.17, when trading of its shares was halted and then suspended in February 2018. The company was put into voluntary administration in February 2018, and then placed in liquidation in May 2019.</p>
<p><span>Notes</span></p>
<p>*Mr Hutchison died in December 2021, but the claims in the IPO Proceeding continue against his estate. The FMA discontinued the claims against Mr Hutchison in the CD Proceeding.</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Rule To Update Definition Of Qualifying Venture Capital Funds - Rule Inflation Adjusts The Dollar Threshold To Be Considered A Qualifying Venture Capital Fund</title>

<div> updates, dollar threshold, qualifying venture capital fund, Investment Company Act, rule

Summary:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has updated the dollar threshold for a "qualifying venture capital fund" to $12 million, adjusted for inflation every five years.
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted a rule that updates the dollar threshold for a fund to qualify as a &ldquo;qualifying venture capital fund&rdquo; for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The rule updates the dollar threshold to $12 million in aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed capital, up from the original threshold of $10 million.</p>
<p>Qualifying venture capital funds are excluded from the Act&rsquo;s definition of an &ldquo;investment company.&rdquo; The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 requires the Commission to index the dollar amount for this threshold for inflation once every five years.</p>
<p>New rule 3c-7 implements this statutory directive and adjusts the dollar amount to $12 million dollars, based on the Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index. The rule also establishes a process for the Commission to make future inflation adjustments to the threshold every five years.</p>
<p>The rule will be effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<div> Commission, revoke, registrations, fraud, violations
Summary:
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is revoking registrations of Purvesh Mankad and his affiliated entities CTAX Partners, LLC and CTAX Series, LLC, for fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The court found them in violation and permanently enjoined them from acting in their registered capacities. The National Futures Association provided assistance in the matter. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it commenced actions to revoke the registrations of&nbsp;Purvesh Mankad, and his affiliated entities&nbsp;CTAX Partners, LLC&nbsp;and&nbsp;CTAX Series, LLC.&nbsp;The CFTC&rsquo;s actions are based on the injunctions entered and findings made by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in&nbsp;<i>CFTC v. Mankad.</i>&nbsp;[Case No. CV-21-01719-PHX-DJH.] The court found that each violated antifraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8615-22">8615-22</a>].</p>
<h4>Case Background</h4>
<p>CTAX Partners, CTAX Series, and Mankad have been registered with the CFTC as an introducing broker, a commodity pool operator, and an associated person of CTAX Partners and CTAX Series, respectively, since 2013. The CFTC&rsquo;s Notice of Intent states their registrations should be revoked because they were all found to have engaged in, among other things, fraud and misappropriation, in violation of the CEA, and were permanently enjoined from acting in their respective registered capacities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/document/guidelines-funds-names-using-esg-or-sustainability-related-terms">translations&nbsp;</a>in all official EU languages of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-05/ESMA34-472-440_Final_Report_Guidelines_on_funds_names.pdf">Guidelines on funds&rsquo; names using ESG or sustainability-related terms</a>.</p>

<p class="text-align-justify">The Guidelines will start applying three months after this publication, i.e. on 21 November 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Within two months of the date of publication of the Guidelines, i.e. on 21 October 2024, national competent authorities must notify ESMA whether they (i) comply, (ii) do not comply, but intend to comply, or (iii) do not comply and do not intend to comply with the guidelines.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission, Independent Commission Against Corruption And Macao Judiciary Police Conduct Joint Operation Against Suspected Cross-Boundary Fraud And Misconduct In Listed Company</title>

<div> operation, fraud, misconduct, arrest, investigation
Summary: 
Joint operation "Demarcation" by SFC, ICAC, and Macao Judiciary Police led to arrests and investigation of cross-boundary fraud and misconduct. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the Macao Judiciary Police jointly mounted an operation codenamed &ldquo;Demarcation&rdquo; on 19 and 20 August 2024 in relation to suspected cross-boundary fraud and misconduct. Senior executives of a listed company in Hong Kong were allegedly involved in fictitious transactions and false accounting totalling around HK$120 million.</p>
<p>Six premises were jointly searched by the SFC and the ICAC. During the joint operation, the ICAC also arrested seven persons, including the chairman and an executive director of the listed company.</p>
<p>The arrestees had allegedly committed the offence of agent using documents with intent to deceive his principal under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that the chairman of the listed company and other individuals had allegedly falsified business documents and accounting records of the company&rsquo;s subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Macao, while the company&rsquo;s trade receivables totalling over MOP113 million (about HK$110 million) were reduced. Meanwhile, the individuals concerned had also allegedly used false documents and accounting records to conceal the misappropriation of the company&rsquo;s funds over HK$9 million.</p>
<p>The above conduct may have resulted in the commission of offences or misconduct by the listed company and/or its management which contravene certain provisions under the Securities and Futures Ordinance for disclosing false or misleading information, as well as for defalcation, fraud, misfeasance, or other misconduct in relation to the conduct of the business or affairs of the listed company.</p>
<p>As cross-boundary crimes were involved in the case, the Macao Judiciary Police also launched an investigation into relevant individuals&rsquo; suspected fraud offences which took place in Macao. Simultaneous to the ICAC operation, the Macao Judiciary Police earlier kicked off the first-of-its-kind concurrent law enforcement action in Macao to search related premises and interview individuals concerned.</p>
<p>As the investigation is ongoing, no further comment will be made by the SFC and the ICAC.</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Christopher Wilson, said: &ldquo;The SFC has zero tolerance when it comes to misconduct undermining the orderliness of the market and misconduct by management of listed companies. The joint action demonstrates the determination of law enforcement agencies in both jurisdictions to combat cross-boundary illegal activities involving listed companies. The SFC will continue to work closely with the ICAC and other local and extraterritorial law enforcement agencies to maintain market integrity and safeguard the interest of investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ICAC&rsquo;s Deputy Commissioner and Head of Operations, Mr Ricky Yau Shu-chun, said: &ldquo;The joint operation fully demonstrates the close collaboration and determination of the two cities&rsquo; law enforcement agencies in tackling cross-boundary corruption and other crimes to maintain a clean and fair business environment and effective operation of the financial market. The ICAC will continue to work with the SFC and other law enforcement agencies to curb corruption and other illegal activities and bring local and cross-boundary criminals to justice.&rdquo;</p>

<title>FICC’s Government Securities Division Achieves New Milestone, Clearing USD$8.8 Trillion in Daily Activity - FICC’s Sponsored Service Generated An Aggregate Average Of Approximately $500bn Daily In Balance Sheet Savings Across The Industry In July 2024</title>

<div> Milestone, FICC, Sponsored Service, clearing, market <br />
Summary: FICC’s GSD processed $8.8 trillion in daily activity, driven by U.S. Treasury market growth and Sponsored Service expansion, supporting market needs.<br /> <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced its Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC&rsquo;s) Government Securities Division (GSD) has reached a new milestone, successfully processing USD$8.8 trillion in daily activity on July 31. The increase represents a jump of over 30% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This significant and continued growth can be attributed to rising volumes and activity in the U.S. Treasury market as well as the continued expansion of FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service, which saw a new peak volume of $1.4 trillion on August 15, growth of 78% year-over-year, including FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored GC Service, which by itself has seen growth of 94% year-over-year. There are now over 2,400 sponsored members across 50 approved jurisdictions participating in FICC clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC&rsquo;s wide range of access models makes it possible for a greater percentage of the market to take advantage of the many benefits of central clearing. One of those models - our Sponsored Service, has become an integral part of the U.S. repo market, offering Sponsoring Members the ability to sponsor their clients into FICC membership to maximize capital efficiency and offer more funding capacity to the market, increasing overall liquidity,&rdquo; stated Laura Klimpel, Managing Director, Head of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. &ldquo;Our new milestones in daily activity demonstrate FICC&rsquo;s robust ability to support rising volumes and volatility and a smooth implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s expanded U.S. Treasury Clearing rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service allows sponsoring members to facilitate the submission of their client&rsquo;s trading activity in eligible securities for novation to FICC. Sponsoring members act as operational and administrative agents on behalf of their clients and guarantee their clients&rsquo; activity to FICC, delivering numerous benefits to participants, including opportunities to reduce counterparty risk, obtain balance sheet and capital relief and increase their transaction capacity.</p>
<p>Specifically, FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service generated an aggregate average of approximately $500bn daily in balance sheet savings across the industry in July 2024, peaking on July 31 at approximately $616bn of aggregate balance sheet savings across the industry.</p>
<p>Added Klimpel, &ldquo;FICC is continually evolving our approach to meet the needs of a broader and more diverse market and support our clients as market structure evolves. As we continue to support increased volumes alongside a much larger member community, FICC will remain a driving force for innovation while ensuring fair and open access for all.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="container">
<p>Insurers and brokers have improved governance and oversight of how products are designed, managed, reviewed, and distributed, but many still cannot show how they are providing fair value to customers or that they were receiving good outcomes.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In a report published today, the FCA set out issues with information sharing between insurers and brokers, and in identifying target markets.</p>
<p><span>Matt Brewis, Director of Insurance at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p>'Insurers need to make sure their customers are getting fair value. Progress is being made, but we are still seeing too many examples of insurers and brokers lacking the right information, governance, or oversight to ensure their customers get consistently good outcomes.</p>
<p>'All insurance firms should take note of our findings and make improvements where appropriate.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;ll continue to take action where we see poor value so consumers can have confidence when buying insurance products.'</p>
<p>In February, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/gap-insurers-agree-suspend-sales-following-fca-concerns-over-fair-value">FCA agreed a pause</a>&nbsp;in the sale of guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance with a number firms, following concerns the products were not offering fair value.</p>
<p>In May, it was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/firms-recommence-gap-insurance-sales-following-fca-action">confirmed</a>&nbsp;that the FCA permitted several GAP insurers to recommence sales following changes to their products.</p>
<p>The regulator has today also published its latest Value Measures Data (January &ndash; December 2023).</p>
<p>It has warned insurers that if they cannot demonstrate that their products meet FCA rules and provide fair value, it will take appropriate regulatory action.</p>

<li>In 2021, the FCA introduced rules requiring insurers to ensure their products provide fair value. This included submitting regular Value Measures Data to the FCA.</li>
<li>The FCA previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-calls-insurers-take-action-publishes-latest-fair-value-data">wrote</a>&nbsp;to insurance firms reminding them of its expectations on fair value.</li>
<li>GAP insurance is typically sold alongside car finance. It covers the difference between a vehicle&rsquo;s purchase price or outstanding finance and its current market value, in the event it is written off before finance has been repaid.</li>
<li>Following the introduction of the Consumer Duty in July 2023, firms are also required to ensure consumers are at the heart of their business and must act to deliver good outcomes for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<title>Market Launch Of Instant Payments In Switzerland</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/market-launch-of-instant-payments-in-switzerland/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/market-launch-of-instant-payments-in-switzerland/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Launch, Instant payments, Swiss market, Financial institutions, Settlement <br />
Summary: <br />Instant payments launched in Swiss market, 60+ financial institutions involved. 24/7 account-to-account transactions with immediate execution, reducing risks, expanding automation opportunities. <div>
<p class="lead">Instant payments were launched in the Swiss market on 20 August 2024. Around 60 financial institutions are now able to receive and process instant payments, covering more than 95% of Swiss retail payment transactions.</p>
<p class="lead"><img alt="Market launch of instant payments in Switzerland" src="https://www.six-group.com/dam/images/media/media-images/2024/ip-illustration.six-image.wide.1020.jpg" /></p>
<div></div>
<div class="fig"></div>
<p>By end-2026 at the latest, all financial institutions active in retail payment transactions will be reachable. The first institutions have already launched retail offerings enabling customers to send instant payments. In the coming months, further banks will announce similar services.</p>
<p>Instant payments allow private individuals and companies to perform account-to-account transactions with immediate execution and final settlement in seconds &ndash; 24 hours a day, 7&nbsp;days a week (including public holidays). This offers significant advantages for individuals, companies and commercial banks. Thanks to shorter settlement chains, risks are reduced and funds received are available immediately. For companies and commercial banks, instant payments expand opportunities for automating processes and linking with other services.</p>
<p>Traditional transfers will still be possible. The Swiss National Bank and SIX Interbank Clearing Ltd anticipate that instant payments are likely to become established in Switzerland in the medium term and form the basis for further innovation in payment transactions.</p>
<p>The technical framework for this new type of payment was put in place with the successful go-live of the new generation of the central Swiss payment system in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/newsroom/media-releases/2024/20240116-six-instant-payment.html">November 2023</a>. This market launch represents a further important milestone and reflects the collective stakeholder commitment to the future of cashless payments in Switzerland.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Statement On Statutory Management For Du Val Corporations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> entities, statutory management, FMA, Corporations Act, investigation <br />
Summary: The Financial Markets Authority placed Du Val group entities in statutory management under the Corporations Act to limit financial deterioration and manage affairs more orderly. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; today confirmed that the Governor-General, on the advice of the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs given in accordance with a recommendation from the FMA, declared a number of entities within the Du Val group be placed in statutory management under the terms of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 (the&nbsp;Corporations Act).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statutory management for these entities was announced by the Minister today, effective immediately. John Fisk, Stephen White and Lara Bennett of PwC New Zealand, who were appointed as interim receivers on 2 August 2024, have been appointed as the Statutory Managers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Corporations Act provides remedies to deal with complex corporate failures and is most appropriate where a company has, or may have been operating fraudulently or recklessly or, alternatively, where the ordinary law is inadequate to deal with an orderly wind up of the companies.&nbsp; In this case, the FMA considers both provisions apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s recommendation was based both on its own investigations and a report from the Court- appointed interim receivers, PwC New Zealand (Report).&nbsp; The Report is currently subject to Court orders restricting its publication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA considers that the conditions under the Corporations Act have been met, and is satisfied that statutory management is the most appropriate available option for each of the Du Val group corporations to which it has been applied, for the purpose of:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>limiting or preventing the risk of further deterioration of the financial affairs of those corporations;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>limiting or preventing the carrying out, or the effects of, any fraudulent act or activity;&nbsp;</li>
<li>preserving the interests of their creditors or beneficiaries or the public interest; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>enabling the affairs of the Du Val group corporations to be managed in a more orderly way.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has ongoing investigations into the Du Val group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Du Val investors and creditors with questions on the statutory management process should contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:nz_duval@pwc.com?subject=Duval-related%20enquiry">PwC New Zealand</a>.</p>

<title>Statement On Amendment To PCAOB Rule 3502 Governing Contributory Liability, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-amendment-to-pcaob-rule-3502-governing-contributory-liability-sec/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Amendments, PCAOB, contributory liability, rule, oversight<br />
Summary:<br />
Oversight of PCAOB, concern about engagement, issues with attendance, evaluation of rulemaking factors, concerns regarding liability rule. <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler. Today, the Commission considers whether to approve two standards and one rule that have been adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Before discussing the first item on amendments to the contributory liability rule, I would like to share some general thoughts on the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of rulemaking by the PCAOB.</p>
<p>In the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Congress vested the Commission with this oversight responsibility when it created the PCAOB.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;It is a responsibility that the Commission should not take lightly, but in carrying out such oversight, the Commission must also recognize that the PCAOB was created as by Congress as a separate organization.</p>
<p>In that respect, the PCAOB should not operate as a subordinate reporting unit of the Commission&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Accountant or to the individual Commission Chair. The PCAOB reports to the Commission, not to the Commission&rsquo;s staff. While I appreciate the regular and constructive engagement between the PCAOB staff and the Commission staff &ndash; and, indeed, I am very appreciative of the regular conversations that I have with Board Chair Erica Williams and each of the Board members throughout the year &ndash; we cannot lose sight of the Congressional directive that the PCAOB operates under the oversight of the Commission as a whole.</p>
<p>Thus, I am disappointed that the PCAOB is not part of today&rsquo;s meeting. The core function for oversight is to inquire &ldquo;what are you doing and why&rdquo; and there is nobody from the PCAOB to answer these or other questions from me or my fellow commissioners. I do not view this approach as an effective method for the Commission to carry out its oversight function, even if it is legally permissible. I fail to understand why the persons with the technical expertise most central to today&rsquo;s decisions are not at the discussion table.</p>
<p>I have been told that having someone from the PCAOB speak at today&rsquo;s meeting may raise procedural issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;However, the Commission&rsquo;s procedures governing consideration of PCAOB rules specifically authorize the Commission to call for oral presentations if they would facilitate consideration of relevant issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Commission chose not to exercise this authority today.</p>
<p>I hope that the Commission re-visits this approach for future rules from the PCAOB.</p>
<p>In deciding whether to approve a PCAOB rulemaking, I consider factors similar to those when I evaluate a Commission rulemaking. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Has the final rule or standard identified the problem that it is trying to solve? Is there data to show that the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; exists or is the PCAOB regulating by hypothesis?</li>
<li>Does the final rule or standard represent a logical outgrowth of the proposal? Have the concepts in the rule or standard been adequately exposed for market participants to evaluate and comment?</li>
<li>Has the PCAOB adequately evaluated, and quantified to the extent possible, the costs of the rule or standard? Costs can be both financial and non-financial and can be borne by the auditing profession, audit firms, companies and broker-dealers subject to an audit, and, most importantly, investors.</li>
<li>Related to costs, has the PCAOB considered the aggregate impact of its rules and standards that will become effective at or around the same time? Or has it adopted tunnel vision to focus only on a particular rule or standard?</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been involved in rulemaking for over 20 years, both at the state and federal levels. Consideration of these factors and thoughtful responses to them are the hallmark of a high-quality rulemaking process.</p>
<p>Turning to the first item &ndash; amendments to the PCAOB&rsquo;s contributory liability rule. Holding persons responsible is an important goal of any regulatory regime. Audit firms violate PCAOB standards when they operate in a negligent manner. However, while audit firms may be responsible for acting negligently, audit firms operate through individuals. What should their responsibility be towards ensuring that the audit firm does not act negligently?</p>
<p>Lowering the standard of conduct for individuals from recklessness to negligence would reverse the PCAOB&rsquo;s 2005 decision to establish a recklessness standard for contributory liability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Audits have become only more complex since 2005. While the PCAOB should have the tools to hold persons accountable, would lowering the standard of conduct for liability do more harm than good to the auditing profession? As some commenters noted, a negligence standard could discourage auditors from taking on more advanced audit roles, have a chilling effect on collaboration among auditors within the same firm, and hinder efforts to reverse the decline in new accountants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>However, a negligence standard would be consistent with the standard of conduct that the Commission needs to prove for its cease-and-desist proceedings against associated persons for contributing to a firm&rsquo;s violations of the Commission&rsquo;s reporting requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Furthermore, a negligence standard would create a parallel standard for liability under the PCAOB&rsquo;s rules. Currently, a firm can commit a primary violation of a standard by acting negligently, but an associated person&rsquo;s secondary liability for that violation is based on a recklessness standard.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Whether a liability rule strikes the right balance between being prophylactic and having no bite will depend on how it is enforced. The PCAOB&rsquo;s adopting release states that the Board &ldquo;does not anticipate that [the rule change] will be used to sanction isolated, good-faith errors in professional judgment&mdash;let alone be wielded as a &lsquo;blunt&rsquo; or &lsquo;draconian&rsquo; instrument&hellip;including with respect to less senior engagement team members.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;I hope that the Board and its staff acts in accordance with that intent in the future.</p>
<p>However, I have not received sufficient assurances that the amendments will strike the right balance when it comes to holding people accountable for unreasonable conduct, as opposed to simply errors in judgment. Accordingly, I will not support these amendments. I thank the PCAOB&rsquo;s members and staff and the Commission staff, especially those from the Office of the Chief Accountant and the Office of the General Counsel.</p>

<title>Modernizing General Responsibilities Auditing Standards, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>

<div> scandals, accounting standards, auditor responsibility, financial reporting, investor protection
<br />
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act strengthened financial reporting, auditors' independence, and investor protection, introducing new standards to modernize and clarify auditor responsibilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Congress enacted the Act against the backdrop of a series of major accounting scandals and accounting frauds that rocked our markets and shattered public confidence in the integrity of financial reporting.</p>
<p>The Act established the Board, which was given the independent responsibility of overseeing public accounting firms and setting auditing standards. It strengthened auditor independence and corporate accountability, enhanced financial disclosures, and made it possible for investors to recoup any losses from securities law violations. The law has played a vital role in ensuring that investors have access to quality financial reporting based on audit opinions that fully comply with applicable audit standards.</p>
<p>Market confidence is tied to the basic presumption that audits of public companies are the product of a process that meets the high standards required by law.</p>
<p>A public accounting company registered with the Board that audits the books of a public company is perceived as credible and reliable. Because it is subject to rigorous oversight.</p>
<p>In making investment decisions, investors rely on the audited financial statements of public companies, disclosed to the public and filed with the Commission. A clean audit opinion carries weight because it is the product of a rigorous process that is designed to protect investors.</p>
<p>These foundational standards, some of them initially issued by the AICPA over five decades ago, address the general principles and responsibilities of the auditor in conducting an audit. These include those relating to due professional care, professional skepticism, competence, and professional judgment.</p>
<p>The new standard does not create new obligations for auditors. However, the auditing environment has evolved significantly since the Board first adopted interim standards in 2003.</p>
<p>In the face of rapid change, investors are better protected with updated and modernized standards that can yield more informative, accurate, and independent financial reporting.</p>
<p>The Board&rsquo;s new standard clarifies the auditor&rsquo;s responsibility to evaluate whether the financial statements are &ldquo;presented fairly&rdquo; in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework, in a manner that is not misleading to investors.</p>
<p>It will also require auditors to assemble a complete and final set of audit documentation in 14 days, instead of the current 45, to reflect the electronic-based environment auditors now operate in.</p>
<p>The new standard clarifies that auditors must exercise professional skepticism and judgment throughout the audit process &ndash; consistent with longstanding investor expectations about the fundamental responsibilities of auditors.</p>
<p>The amendments should benefit investors by making auditors&rsquo; foundational obligations clearer and more user-friendly. Firms will be in a better position to train new auditors. Investors and audit committees can better understand what auditor responsibilities are, ultimately improving the quality of financial reporting.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s staff has determined that the Board&rsquo;s amendments are consistent with Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and associated rules and regulations. Following its own thorough review of the Board&rsquo;s efforts, and extensive engagement with the Board throughout the process, Commission staff has also determined that the amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The staff is therefore recommending Commission approval and I am pleased to support.</p>

<title>Statement On Amendments Related To Aspects Of Designing And Performing Audit Procedures That Involve Technology-Assisted Analysis Of Information In Electronic Form, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Amendments, PCAOB, Technology, Audit, Implementation
Summary:<br />Amendments to PCAOB standards address technology-assisted analysis. Concerns raised about prescriptive approach to testing. Commission calls for implementation guidance. Technology Innovation Alliance Working Group formed.<br /> <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler, and thank you to the staff for your presentation.</p>
<p>The third item on today&rsquo;s agenda is a set of amendments designed to revise and conform PCAOB standards affected by auditors&rsquo; expanded use of technology-assisted analysis as part of their audit. Updating standards to keep pace with rapidly evolving uses of technology is both necessary and challenging. The types of technology or technology-assisted analysis meant to be captured by a standard today could become obsolete next year. Accordingly, a principles-based, rather than prescriptive, approach to standard setting is more ideal to ensure that the standards continue to be effective and avoid obsolescence.</p>
<p>The PCAOB states that today&rsquo;s amendments are principles-based.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;However, some market participants noted in their comments to the Commission that the final standard relating to evaluating the reliability of external information provided in electronic form may require a much more prescriptive approach.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;These commenters interpreted the final standard as requiring the auditor to test all information in electronic form that the company provided to it, regardless of the auditor&rsquo;s risk assessment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The commenters noted that this approach seemed to contradict the PCAOB&rsquo;s intent for a scalable, risk-based approach and called for implementation guidance from the Board.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Evaluating whether a PCAOB standard clearly communicates to market participants their obligations is part of the Commission&rsquo;s oversight responsibility when deciding whether to approve the standard. Based on language contained in the adopting release for the amendments, the Commission does not believe that the PCAOB intended for a prescriptive approach to testing external information provided in electronic form.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;However, given commenters&rsquo; concerns, the Commission encourages the PCAOB to provide implementation guidance on this issue.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In light of the Commission&rsquo;s acknowledgment of commenters&rsquo; concerns and its call for implementation guidance, I support the amendments related to standards involving technology-assisted analysis. I look forward to seeing the PCAOB&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
<p>Before concluding, I would like to acknowledge the importance of ensuring that both the Commission&rsquo;s and the PCAOB&rsquo;s rules keep pace with technology. While today&rsquo;s amendments were intended to address only one area of auditor&rsquo;s use of technology, several commenters called for the PCAOB to undertake a broader review of how technology, including artificial intelligence, affects audits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Although this broader study of technology was outside the scope of today&rsquo;s amendment, the PCAOB has created a Technology Innovation Alliance Working Group to evaluate the use of emerging technologies in the audit space.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;I look forward to seeing the recommendations from this group.</p>
<p>Thank you to the PCAOB&rsquo;s members and staff and the Commission staff, especially those from the Office of the Chief Accountant and the Office of the General Counsel.</p>

<title>Enhancing Audit Quality Through Technology-Adaptable Audit Standards, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>

<div> auditors, data analytics, PCAOB, audit standards, technology-based tools <br />
Summary:<br /> 
Auditors adapt to data analytics, PCAOB updates standards for electronic data analysis, improving audit quality, efficiency, and reliability of financial reporting.<br /> <div>
<p>In recent years, auditors have expanded their use of data analytics. This trend has been driven both by advances in data analysis tools and increased access by auditors to large volumes of company- and third-party-generated data.</p>
<p>Where existing auditing standards designed for another era fall short of their potential to help auditors improve audit quality, it makes sense to adapt them to current realities. Audit procedures that rely on data analytics but that are not appropriately designed or executed, may not yield the audit evidence required by current auditing standards.</p>
<p>The PCAOB&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) proposed updates will assist auditors in better analyzing information in electronic form with technology-based tools. The amendments are designed to reduce the likelihood that an auditor will issue a report without obtaining sufficient audit evidence that provides a reasonable basis for its audit opinion.</p>
<p>The Board has noted that the amendments will help auditors design and perform more effective audit procedures, leading to higher audit quality and benefiting investors. The updated audit standards could also result in more efficient audits and lower audit fees. And the clarity and regulatory certainty they offer could encourage auditors to implement new technologies.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s staff has determined that the Board&rsquo;s amendments are consistent with Title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and associated rules and regulations. Following its own thorough review of the Board&rsquo;s efforts, and extensive engagement with the Board throughout the process, Commission staff has also determined that the amendments are necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The staff is therefore recommending Commission approval.</p>
<p>I am pleased to find myself in agreement with the staff recommendation and pleased to support these sensible amendments that will yield principles-based standards designed to be adaptable to future changes in technology and that improve the reliability of financial reporting.</p>

<div> Keywords: PCAOB, Rule 3502, liability standard, audit quality, AS 1000, technology-assisted analysis<br />
Summary: The article discusses the PCAOB's proposed rule and standards, concern for audit quality, support for new auditing standard, and reservations about amendments related to technology-assisted analysis. It also asks questions regarding the limits of the PCAOB's authority, potential challenges related to the liability standard, and the effective date of the new standard. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today, we are considering three proposals&mdash;one rule and two standards&mdash;from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;). The auditor&rsquo;s calling is fundamental to the health of the capital markets. For this reason, we want to ensure that the standards and rules governing auditors are clear and sensible, do not rob auditors of their confidence to exercise judgment, and that they facilitate auditors&rsquo; focus on the critical job of ensuring that financial statements are reliable. The Commission&rsquo;s review of the PCAOB&rsquo;s rules and standards is integral to the process that Congress established to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the PCAOB&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Commission review of PCAOB standard-setting is particularly important now. First, as evidenced by high audit deficiency rates<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>&nbsp;and much enforcement saber rattling,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a>&nbsp;the PCAOB appears to be struggling with its critical mission of fostering audit quality. Second, the PCAOB is rushing new standards out the door without due regard for internal deliberation, public input, economic analysis, or implementation issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a>&nbsp;Third, as many at the PCAOB and outside have noted, the audit profession faces challenges, including high rates of concentration, low rates of new recruits, and exits by seasoned auditors. While many factors contribute to these challenges, deliberate and prudent regulatory steps can mitigate them while hasty and ill-considered steps will exacerbate them.</p>
<p>Thank you to Chair Williams, Board Members Ho, Stein, Thompson, and Botic, the PCAOB staff, and SEC staff, including staff in the Office of the Chief Accountant, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel. Your passion for high audit quality audits, which are so important to our capital markets, is evident in the work that you do.</p>
<p><i>Proposed Amendments to PCAOB Rule 3502 Governing Contributory Liability</i></p>
<p>I do not support the proposed change in the contributory liability standard from recklessness to simple negligence. This change is neither consistent with the requirements of the securities laws, nor necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>&nbsp;It could have the unintended consequence of lowering audit quality and could worsen the trend toward fewer talented individuals entering the auditing profession. The more expansive liability standard reverses, without any clear reason for doing so other than &ldquo;because we can,&rdquo; the twenty-year old PCAOB decision not to adopt a negligence standard.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a>&nbsp;This decision reflects the PCAOB&rsquo;s recent emphasis on aggressive enforcement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a>&nbsp;When placed in that context, the refusal to limit application of the new contributory negligence rule to multiple instances of negligent conduct is concerning.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a>&nbsp;When paired with the PCAOB&rsquo;s stated plan to &ldquo;aggressively pursu[e] all statutory legal theories for charging respondents,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a>&nbsp;assurances that it &ldquo;intends to deploy its prosecutorial discretion responsibly&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a>&nbsp;provide little comfort. The PCAOB of course should enforce its rules, but bringing formal enforcement actions should not be the first tool a regulator grabs when deficiencies are identified -- particularly when the conduct at issue is merely negligent.</p>
<p>As many commenters on the PCAOB&rsquo;s proposal pointed out, this change is unnecessary and could have adverse consequences on audit quality. The PCAOB already can and does pursue individual misconduct under its existing rules. The SEC, state accountancy boards, and audit firms already can respond to individuals&rsquo; negligent contributory conduct. The PCAOB interacts often with the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Accountant and staff from the Division of Enforcement and can refer any instances of negligent misconduct to the SEC. The PCAOB&rsquo;s own economic analysis estimates that this change will yield only two or three additional cases for the PCAOB each year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[x]</a>&nbsp;The benefits are therefore likely limited, but the costs are likely to be high because audit professionals could be overcome by risk aversion as they fear being second-guessed by a PCAOB enforcement regime armed with the clarity found only in hindsight analysis. It adds yet one more reason for people to leave or never join the audit profession<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[xi]</a>&nbsp;or to refuse to take on roles in important areas like quality control. The lower liability standard may be particularly challenging for small and foreign firms. The PCAOB acknowledges that &ldquo;the amendment could lead some firms to exit the issuer audit market,&rdquo; but rather than seriously grapple with this potential cost, the PCAOB instead looks forward to a &ldquo;landscape . . . characterized by a higher concentration of more capable and compliant audit firms&rdquo; as an outcome that mitigates &ldquo;the negative impacts on the competitive landscape.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[xii]</a>&nbsp;The PCAOB should work with audit firms to improve quality, rather than seek to clear the landscape of all but the biggest firms.</p>
<p>I have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Several commenters questioned the PCAOB&rsquo;s authority to adopt this amendment. The Commission&rsquo;s order affirms the PCAOB&rsquo;s authority under Sections 103 and 105 of Sarbanes-Oxley. The PCAOB also cites another provision as authority&mdash;the Sarbanes-Oxley directive that &ldquo;[t]he rules of the board shall . . . provide for the operation and administration of the Board, the exercise of its authority, and the performance of its responsibilities under this Act.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[xiii]</a>&nbsp;That provision seems inapt and, if used as authority for a rule like this one, potentially eviscerates any limits on the PCAOB&rsquo;s authority. What are the limits to the PCAOB&rsquo;s authority under Section 101(g) of Sarbanes-Oxley?</li>
<li>How will this new negligence-based liability standard interact with what one commenter described as the PCAOB&rsquo;s shift away from principles-based and toward rules-based standard-setting?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[xiv]</a></li>
<li>The PCAOB acknowledged that this rule and the quality control standard that the PCAOB recently finalized &ldquo;could overlap to cover the same conduct in some circumstances&rdquo; and explained the value of &ldquo;the&nbsp;<i>potential</i>&nbsp;to be held individually liable for contributory negligence [which] may increase the amount of care and attention dedicated to QC by responsible individuals.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[xv]</a>&nbsp;Are you concerned that this change in the liability standard could cause some people to avoid taking on quality control roles, particularly with a new and unfamiliar quality control standard potentially coming into effect?</li>
<li>The PCAOB insists that it is not planning to use the standard to go after junior auditors, but one of the PCAOB&rsquo;s arguments in favor of the rule change is that &ldquo;the market-driven consequences relating to the auditor reporting model and identification of auditors on Form AP are felt primarily (if not exclusively) by the engagement partner on an audit, while Rule 3502 applies more broadly.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[xvi]</a>&nbsp;Are you concerned that this rule could dissuade people from entering the audit profession because they will fear that an early career misstep could be the basis for a PCAOB enforcement action?</li>
<li>After this change takes effect, in what types of self-protective behavior might associated persons engage to avoid being charged with contributory negligence, and how might such self-protective conduct undermine the collaborative nature and efficiency of audits?</li>
<li>The PCAOB explained that &ldquo;an increase in the&nbsp;<i>number</i>&nbsp;of regulators on alert for the same or similar violative conduct increases the likelihood of that conduct being detected and, consequently, the likelihood that the conduct would be sanctioned.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn17" name="_ednref17">[xvii]</a>&nbsp;Although it does not currently have the ability to bring negligence-based charges against individuals, the PCAOB nevertheless should be on the lookout for such conduct since it can make referrals to the SEC.<ol>
<li>How frequently has the PCAOB over the past two decades referred negligence-based misconduct by individuals to the SEC?</li>
<li>In how many of those instances has the SEC declined to bring a negligence-based secondary liability charge?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>As one commenter noted, when the SEC brings negligence-based cases, it typically also brings a case under Rule 102(e) of the SEC&rsquo;s Rules of Practice. For that rule to apply, there must be either &ldquo;repeated instances of unreasonable conduct&rdquo; or &ldquo;a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;higher than ordinary negligence but lower than the traditional definition of recklessness.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn18" name="_ednref18">[xviii]</a>&nbsp;Will the PCAOB be bringing cases that the SEC would not since the SEC in practice has not pursued instances of simple negligence?</li>
<li>I appreciate the PCAOB&rsquo;s assurances that it does not intend to use this new liability standard &ldquo;to sanction isolated, good-faith errors in professional judgment,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn19" name="_ednref19">[xix]</a>&nbsp;but how do we ensure that the PCAOB does not use this lower standard to look through the unforgiving lens of hindsight to punish a well-intentioned auditor for her work on a highly complex and collaborative audit engagement that entailed judgments about which reasonable minds can disagree?</li>
</ol>
<p><i>AS 1000, General Responsibilities of the Auditor in Conducting an Audit and Amendments to PCAOB Standards</i></p>
<p>I support this new auditing standard, which, in the words of the PCAOB, &ldquo;reaffirm[s] the general principles and responsibilities of the auditor so that the foundation underlying our standards continues to be sound and appropriate for performing high-quality audits.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn20" name="_ednref20">[xx]</a>&nbsp;Undergirding my support is an expectation that the PCAOB will stand ready to provide guidance, answer questions, monitor for issues during implementation, and conduct a post-implementation review. The new standard, by modernizing, and consolidating a group of interim standards adopted at the PCAOB&rsquo;s inception, should facilitate compliance and strengthen audit quality.</p>
<p>The adopting release is helpful in setting the basic parameters within which auditors operate. It reaffirms that the auditor&rsquo;s fundamental obligation is to protect investors through the preparation and issuance of independent auditor&rsquo;s reports. While this language does not change auditors&rsquo; obligations, it places appropriate emphasis on the investor. AS 1000&rsquo;s shortening of the time period within which auditors must complete their workpapers also should be protective of investors. The PCAOB worked to balance principle-based standards with specificity in response to commenters&rsquo; questions.</p>
<p>Commenters also were generally supportive of AS 1000 but underscored the need for implementation guidance and post-implementation review. I have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>One commentator opined that &ldquo;The adoption of AS 1000 is expected to have a profound impact on the auditing profession.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn21" name="_ednref21">[xxi]</a>&nbsp;Do you agree? If so, what do you anticipate being the biggest changes resulting from this standard?</li>
<li>The adopting release states that auditors should pay attention to guidance, whether included in an adopting release or staff guidance, but that such guidance is not binding.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[xxii]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Did the PCAOB put all guidance intended to be authoritative in the standard itself as opposed to in the accompanying release?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Our order states: &ldquo;For audits of stub periods, we believe the effective date of the document completion requirement is clear. Nevertheless, we encourage the PCAOB staff to consider the need to provide additional guidance which could be useful to firms.&rdquo; What is the effective date of the document completion requirement for stub periods?</li>
<li>The standard requires auditors to critically assess &ldquo;audit evidence and other information that is obtained to comply with PCAOB standards and rules.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn23" name="_ednref23">[xxiii]</a>&nbsp;AS 1105 governs the critical assessment of audit evidence, but what standard applies to the critical assessment of other information that is obtained to comply with PCAOB standards and rules?</li>
<li>This standard is applicable to audits of broker-dealers, but the adopting release barely mentions broker-dealer audits. Did the PCAOB adequately consider unique issues related to broker-dealer audits?</li>
<li>At the open meeting adopting this standard, one of the PCAOB economists acknowledged the assistance of the SEC in preparing the economic analysis. What was our contribution to the analysis? What does the statute require of us and the PCAOB when it comes to performing an economic analysis?</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Amendments Related to Aspects of Designing and Performing Audit Procedures that Involve Technology-Assisted Analysis of Information in Electronic Form</i></p>
<p>I support, albeit with reservations, today&rsquo;s amendments to the PCAOB&rsquo;s standards on&nbsp;<i>Audit Evidence</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Auditor&rsquo;s Responses to the Risks of Material Misstatement</i>. These amendments should help to guide auditors as they increase their use of technology-assisted analysis of information in electronic form. These amendments should help to alleviate the uncertainty that has led to different practices across firms and has kept some firms from using data analytics. This standard is a good start, and I look forward to the PCAOB&rsquo;s continuing efforts to provide regulatory clarity around how auditors can use&mdash;and respond to their clients&rsquo; use of&mdash;new technologies, including artificial intelligence and blockchain.</p>
<p>While these amendments provide clarity about the use of technology, the associated burden on auditors and their clients is unclear. This standard could be very expensive. The ambiguity around the cost of these amendments flows from how the standard was drafted coupled with questions about how it will be implemented. Our approval order addresses some of the concerns raised by commenters and &ldquo;encourage[s] the PCAOB to provide further implementation guidance&rdquo; affirming the acceptability of a risk-based approach. I still have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you discussed with the PCAOB its plans with respect to developing implementation guidance, working with firms on implementation, setting up a mechanism for consulting on implementation questions, monitoring implementation, considering how this standard interacts with other forthcoming standards, and conducting a retrospective assessment of the costs and benefits of these changes?</li>
<li>The final amendments require auditors, among other things, to &ldquo;evaluate whether external information provided by the company in electronic form and used as audit evidence is reliable by &ldquo;testing the information to determine whether it has been modified by the company and evaluating the effect of those modifications; or testing controls over receiving, maintaining, and processing the information (including, where applicable, information technology general controls and automated application controls)&rdquo; and explains that such information includes &ldquo;cash receipts, shipping documents, and purchase orders.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn24" name="_ednref24">[xxiv]</a>&nbsp;Given that this language sounds very expansive, commenters struggled to understand whether the amendments are truly risk-based. I would like to get your reaction to some of their concerns:<ol>
<li>Must &ldquo;the auditor, in all circumstances and without regard to the auditor&rsquo;s assessment of risk, . . . perform specific procedures to determine whether or not any intentional or unintentional modifications have been made to information a company receives from external sources and provides to the auditor in electronic form&rdquo;?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn25" name="_ednref25">[xxv]</a></li>
<li>Must an auditor look at the non-electronic source document? What if no hardcopy exists because &ldquo;a purchase order [was] sent to the company in the form of a PDF attachment in an email or [was] submitted through an electronic portal), or the hardcopies themselves may routinely be digitized and discarded upon receipt&rdquo;?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn26" name="_ednref26">[xxvi]</a>&nbsp;Or does an auditor have to &ldquo;test each piece of information received in electronic form by obtaining a copy of the electronic information directly from the original source of the external information&rdquo;?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[xxvii]</a></li>
<li>An auditor may test controls instead of testing information, but the release states that &ldquo;[c]ontrols over processing the information would include internal controls over&nbsp;<i>any</i>&nbsp;modifications made by the company to the information.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn28" name="_ednref28">[xxviii]</a>&nbsp;What is the significance of &ldquo;any,&rdquo; which was added at the adopting stage?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn29" name="_ednref29">[xxix]</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;If the company did not explicitly identify a risk of material misstatement related to the&nbsp;<span>risk of modification</span>&nbsp;. . . of the electronic information,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn30" name="_ednref30"><span><span>[xxx]</span></span></a>&nbsp;does the auditor have to demand the company implement effective internal controls?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>In setting the effective date for this standard, did the PCAOB take into account work that auditors will need to do to incorporate elements of other standards that were recently adopted or proposed? For example, one commenter noted that &ldquo;the PCAOB&rsquo;s proposed amendments to AS 2301, The Auditor&rsquo;s Responses to the Risks of Material Misstatement (specifically, new paragraph .40A), which are part of the PCAOB&rsquo;s proposal to replace extant AS 2305, would create significant new implementation challenges for both issuers and auditors by broadening the scope of evidence subject to AS 1105.10A(b)&rsquo;s prescriptive requirements.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-pcaob-082024#_edn31" name="_ednref31">[xxxi]</a></li>
<li>Will companies need to implement or formalize controls or processes around information received from one or more external sources, which auditors will then need to check for appropriate design and implementation? If so, does applying the standard to audits of financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2025 give companies enough time?</li>

<title>SEC Charges Transfer Agent Equiniti Trust Co. With Failing To Protect Client Funds Against Cyber Intrusions - Equiniti, Formerly Known As American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, Lost Millions Of Dollars Of Client Funds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Settled, charges, SEC, Equiniti Trust Company, cyber intrusions<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC settled charges against Equiniti for failing to protect client funds and securities from cyber intrusions, leading to $6.6M in losses. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based registered transfer agent Equiniti Trust Company LLC, formerly known as American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company LLC, for failing to assure that client securities and funds were protected against theft or misuse. Those failures led to the loss of more than $6.6 million of client funds as a result of two separate cyber intrusions in 2022 and 2023. American Stock Transfer was able to recover approximately $2.6 million of the losses and fully reimbursed the clients for their losses. To settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges, Equiniti agreed to pay a civil penalty of $850,000.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, in September 2022, an unknown threat actor hijacked a pre-existing email chain between what was then American Stock Transfer and a U.S.-based public-issuer client. The threat actor, pretending to be an employee at the issuer, then instructed American Stock Transfer to issue millions of new shares of the issuer, liquidate those shares, and send the proceeds to an overseas bank. The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that American Stock Transfer followed these instructions and transferred approximately $4.78 million to bank accounts located in Hong Kong, of which American Stock Transfer was able to recover approximately $1 million.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, around April 2023, in an unrelated incident, an unknown threat actor used stolen Social Security numbers of certain American Stock Transfer accountholders to create fake accounts that were automatically linked by American Stock Transfer to real client accounts based solely on the matching Social Security numbers, even though the names and other personal information associated with the fraudulent accounts did not match those of the legitimate accounts. This allowed the threat actor to liquidate securities held in the legitimate accounts and transfer a total of approximately $1.9 million in proceeds to external bank accounts, of which American Stock Transfer was able to recover approximately $1.6 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;American Stock Transfer failed to provide the safeguards necessary to protect its clients&rsquo; funds and securities from the types of cyber intrusions that have become a near-constant threat to companies and the markets,&rdquo; said Monique C. Winkler, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s San Francisco Regional Office. &ldquo;As threat actors become more sophisticated in the cyber space, transfer agents must act to implement and maintain effective safeguards and procedures around client assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Equiniti violated Section 17A(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17Ad-12 thereunder. In addition to the civil penalty referenced above, Equiniti agreed to a cease-and-desist order and censure.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Heather Marlow and Hannah Cho and supervised by David Zhou and Jason H. Lee, all of the San Francisco Regional Office.</p>

<title>Statement In Support Of The New Standard On The General Responsibilities Of The Auditor, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>

<div> investors, financial statements, auditing standard, PCAOB, trust<br />
Summary:<br />
AS 1000 reaffirms auditor duties to protect investors, sets high-quality audit standards, and supports the PCAOB's role as an independent regulator. <div>
<p>Auditing Standard 1000 (&ldquo;AS 1000&rdquo;) is an important step forward for investors and all users of financial statements. The standard reaffirms the auditor&rsquo;s duty to protect investors; to act with due professional care, skepticism, and judgment; and to perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting are sound.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>A high-quality audit is the foundation upon which investor trust and flows of capital are built. And the requirements of AS 1000 form the building blocks of that foundation. The U.S. capital markets are often the best option for everyday investors seeking a place for their hard-earned dollars to grow into a down payment for a home, college tuition, or a secure retirement. But the system that makes up our markets is inherently complex. Investors must navigate an intricate web of actors with varying incentives, layers of specialization, and a host of technical functions. When evaluating issuances of securities and the financial statements that underlie their value, investors must rely upon specialists like auditors. In order to ensure that their trust in and expectations of auditors, and actors like them, is not misplaced, it is necessary to have a meaningful baseline of professional standards that carry consequences for failing to meet them. These are the standards that AS 1000 requires.</p>
<p>Further, in proposing and adopting AS 1000, the PCAOB is exercising its crucial role as an independent regulator of the auditing profession. AS 1000 replaces a group of standards that were adopted wholesale from the standards written by the profession itself decades ago through the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&ldquo;AICPA&rdquo;). In that initial release, the PCAOB noted that the AICPA standards were adopted on a &ldquo;transitional basis&rdquo; to ensure continuity, and the PCAOB would establish &ldquo;a schedule and procedure for the review of all Interim Professional Auditing Standards&rdquo; to determine whether those interim standards would be appropriate as permanent PCAOB standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;That was over 21 years ago. Until recently, the vast majority of relevant interim standards remained in substantially the same form in which they were adopted and many were decades old.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;I applaud this PCAOB for its leadership and for fulfilling its role as an independent auditing standard setter and regulator of the audit profession.</p>
<p>The PCAOB is living up to its obligations to protect investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports so that there is a foundation upon which investor confidence and trust can be anchored. Thank you to the hardworking staff of the Office of the Chief Accountant at the SEC as well as the members of the PCAOB and its staff.</p>

<title>Remarks On The Economic Outlook And Financial Inclusion, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Alaska Bankers Association, Anchorage, Alaska</title>

<div> Central Bank Network, financial inclusion, CDFIs, Indigenous communities, monetary policy<br />
<br />Summary: The Federal Reserve member discusses monetary policy, financial inclusion, and support for Indigenous communities through the Central Bank Network and community partnerships. <div>
<p>Good morning. It is really a pleasure to join you here in Alaska.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Getting outside of Washington, D.C. and hearing about the unique issues that affect Alaskans provides valuable insights that inform my work at the Federal Reserve. A part of the mission of the Federal Reserve is to support an economy that works for everyone. Consumers and communities are more successful when they have access to financial products and services that meet their needs. While many of these products and services are available online, as Alaskans know better than most Americans, geography and location are also important. This access often looks very different in places with many remote and rural communities. Today, I will discuss the Federal Reserve's work to promote a more inclusive financial system, including our work on financial inclusion for Indigenous communities. Before diving into those topics, I will share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook</strong><br />Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>After seeing considerable progress last year, in recent months we have seen some further progress on lowering inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer to the more volatile higher-frequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively. In addition, the latest consumer and producer price index reports indicate that 12-month core PCE inflation likely remained a bit above 2.5 percent in July. The progress in lowering inflation since April is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace last year. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth was solid and slowed much less than gross domestic product (GDP), as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth. Goods spending rebounded in the second quarter and retail sales continued to rise at a solid pace in July.</p>
<p>Consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we've seen a normalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased and the number of available jobs has declined&mdash;signs that illustrate the labor market is coming into better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a more modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in July. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate. In addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic level. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as measured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains remain above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.</p>
<p>My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality as the risks to the Committee's employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into better balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation as supply conditions have now largely normalized and any further improvements to supply seem less likely to offset price pressures arising from increasing geopolitical tensions, additional fiscal stimulus, and increased demand for housing due to immigration.</p>
<p>There are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, and it appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report suggests that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, and layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment rate in July was largely accounted for by workers who are experiencing a temporary layoff and are more likely to be rehired in coming months. Hurricane Beryl also likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last month.</p>
<p>In light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen additional economic data and information, including one employment and one inflation report. We will also monitor how developments in broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook.</p>
<p>I will continue to closely watch the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while watching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on Financial Inclusion</strong><br />I will turn now to discuss our work to promote financial inclusion. An inclusive financial system enables access to financial services that enhance the financial well-being of consumers and businesses. Consumers come from a wide range of economic circumstances, with varied perceptions of and experiences with the banking system and different financial needs. All consumers should have access to the financial services and products they need.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy benefits when more households achieve financial stability. Yet, while we have made significant progress in expanding access to financial services and deposit accounts in the United States, the remaining challenges often include geographic location, products that meet specific customer needs, the absence of financial literacy education, lack of access to technology and reliable internet, and in some cases, language. These challenges are even more acute in providing access to financial services to Indigenous populations like those here in Alaska. It is impressive to see that many financial services providers, including banks and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), are working to address these challenges and making significant inroads.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of banks in furthering financial inclusion</strong><br />The U.S. financial system is uniquely positioned to bring consumers into the financial mainstream by providing innovative solutions to meet the credit needs of their communities. Banks and other depository institutions assist consumers and small businesses by providing financial products and services that are safe, fair, and responsive. In doing so, they serve a critical role in connecting consumers to the financial system and to the economy.</p>
<p>Smaller banks, including community banks, are indispensable in providing access to financial products and services, especially in more remote or rural areas. Here, in Alaska, your banks are the front-line providers for your communities. As you know well, community banks support small businesses through credit and technical assistance and targeted support specific to customers in their communities. As a former community banker, I know firsthand that smaller banks deeply understand their communities because they live in the local economy and know their customers well.</p>
<p>This was especially apparent during the COVID pandemic. Community banks rose to the challenge and continued to support the needs of their customers and communities. One of the programs first made available in response to the pandemic was the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was geared to small businesses and was necessarily dependent on community banks. The PPP was timely and effective in helping millions of businesses weather the initial phase of the pandemic, and community banks were absolutely essential to the success of the program.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>This successful outcome is probably not surprising to this audience, because when it comes to lending to small businesses, community banks have always been an outsized source of credit, relative to their size in the banking system. Before the pandemic, community banks accounted for over 40 percent of all small business lending, while they only accounted for roughly 15 percent of total assets in the banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;This trend has continued. An analysis of June 2023 call report data showed that community banks had larger shares of small-business loans relative to their total assets than larger institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Community banks know their customers, and they know their communities. During that challenging time, community bank CEOs told me that early in the pandemic they directly contacted every single one of their business and consumer loan customers. They took the time to check in with each one to see how they were doing, and what they needed. They encouraged customers to keep in touch with the bank, and they noted the available opportunities for payment deferrals and other options that customers might not have been aware of. Because of this relationship banking model, small banks were and continue to be able to provide more tailored financial products and services that are designed to meet the specific needs of their customers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>We all recognize the important role of small banks in the functioning of the U.S. economy by supporting the financial needs of their customers and communities. The Federal Reserve relies on insights from community banks and created a mechanism to formalize the views and feedback from community banks on a regular basis through our Reserve Bank and Board Community Depository Institutions Advisory Councils (CDIAC). The Board CDIAC includes a representative from each of the local advisory councils at the 12 Reserve Banks. CDIAC members are bankers from community banks, thrifts, and credit unions who provide insight and information about the economy, lending conditions, and other issues that they see firsthand in their communities.</p>
<p>This perspective helps us gain insights into economic activity and the impact of our policies on rural and underserved communities.</p>
<p><strong>Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion</strong><br />I will turn now to highlight our efforts in providing broader access to financial services. In 2021, the Federal Reserve became a member of the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion (CBNII).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This group brings together the central banks of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The network enabled us to initiate an ongoing international dialogue to raise awareness of economic and financial issues in Indigenous populations. This allows us to share knowledge and best practices, promote engagement and education, and work together with Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>As the Federal Reserve's representative to the network, I have prioritized expanding our outreach and engagement efforts to include all U.S. Native populations, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, and Native American. Coming here to Alaska is a key part of this role to ensure that the Federal Reserve continues to expand our firsthand knowledge and understanding of the issues and barriers that may prevent full engagement in the economy. I take these responsibilities seriously and have made meeting with and learning from Indigenous groups and leaders a priority in my work.</p>
<p>In October 2021, I met with Native American leaders in South Dakota and on the Pine Ridge Reservation. These tribal leaders highlighted the importance of building understanding by meeting with people in their communities to enhance our knowledge of their social and economic circumstances. Earlier this year and last year, I met with members of the Native Hawaiian community and a range of community organizations to learn about the issues and challenges they face, in addition to the recovery efforts following the devastating wildfire in Lahaina. And yesterday, I met with Native Alaskan leaders to learn about Alaska Native corporations and other initiatives here in Alaska. These convenings and conversations help to inform our work at the Federal Reserve to ensure that the financial system is accessible to everyone, including Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The Fed's work in this area is supported by many of our Reserve Bank teams, including the San Francisco Reserve Bank, the Minneapolis Center for Indian Country Development, and the St. Louis Native Economic and Financial Education Empowerment program. Together, these teams and programs support Indigenous organizations and tribal nations by providing actionable data and research, economic and personal finance education, and other resources to advance opportunities for prosperity in Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>We know that the economic well-being of all Americans is an important aspect of the Federal Reserve's goal to increase economic inclusion, and it is one of the reasons we began participating in the CBNII. Even with all of its tools, the Federal Reserve cannot fully succeed until all Americans, including our Native populations and those existing on the margins of the economy, have the opportunity to fully participate. Engagement in these learning opportunities, including these meetings, will help to advance this goal.</p>
<p><strong>Mission-driven organizations</strong><br />Finally, I would like to briefly address the Federal Reserve's efforts to build the institutional capacity of another set of key stakeholders: Minority Depository Institutions, Women-Owned Depository Institutions, and CDFIs, whose missions are to reach historically underserved populations. Providing support for these institutions is an important part of the Federal Reserve's responsibility to provide a safe, sound, and accessible banking system that protects consumers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>These mission-driven banks and CDFIs are often vital sources of capital to many underrepresented small businesses. CDFIs generally target specific underserved markets. For example, there are many Native CDFIs, including several here in Alaska, that support Native communities by providing access to credit, capital, and financial services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;While there has been some significant growth in Native CDFIs,<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;they cannot singlehandedly resolve the credit needs of this population. This effort will require partnerships with banks, state and local governments, and community stakeholders. As an example, the Federal Reserve convened a small business lending working group that brought together local, state, and federal partners to address challenges with access to capital for Alaskan small businesses, especially those owned by Native Alaskans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;This group has helped connect local Native CDFIs to banks and state and federal partners for funding and technical assistance.</p>
<p>Finally, I will close with a brief note on the revisions to the CDFI Certification Application recently released by the Treasury's CDFI Fund.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240820a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;There are significant benefits to being a certified CDFI, including access to federal, state, and local governmental funds, philanthropic support, and private sector investment. While the certification process is overseen by the CDFI Fund, I encourage CDFI banks to review the new certification application and share feedback on whether the requirements are attainable and remain compatible with the bank's existing business model.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />In closing, thank you again for welcoming me here today. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to learn from your experiences and incorporate these lessons into our work. The unique challenges that you face here in Alaska will help to inform and expand the Federal Reserve's understanding of how we can make the financial system more inclusive. Our meetings over the past few days with state government officials, Native Alaskan leaders, small business owners, and financial institutions provide many different perspectives to help inform our work to achieve an economy that works for everyone.</p>

<title>Statement In Support Of Technology-Assisted Analysis Amendments, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Technology is everywhere. As I was driving last week, I remembered how road trips used to require paper maps with highlighted routes &ndash; ones that didn&rsquo;t tell you exactly where you made a wrong turn or how to fix it. And likewise, when I was in school, research that used to take hours at the library across multiple media &ndash; including sitting at a microfiche reader and scrolling through old clips &ndash; now takes place in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Indeed, technological innovation has so fundamentally changed how we operate in the course of our lifetimes that it feels like we should add it to the list of death and taxes as among life&rsquo;s few certainties.</p>
<p>And while technology may make the performance of our responsibilities easier and more efficient, we should not allow it to erode our commitment to the fundamental principles that underlie our auditing framework.</p>
<p>Our third matter today upholds this precept. The requirement that auditors must plan and perform audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to support their opinion on a company&rsquo;s financial statements remains unchanged and holds true whether technology-assisted analysis is used or not.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-technology-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s amendments advance that requirement by providing clarity on how to obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence if technology-assisted analysis is used.</p>
<p>I commend the staff at the PCAOB for taking the time to study the increased use of technology by both auditors and companies, and then crafting amendments that seek to advance high-quality audits and investor protection. The PCAOB staff&rsquo;s work provides yet another example of how regulatory frameworks can complement the increased use of helpful technologies. I look forward to seeing how innovations in the audit profession will continue to grow and improve, to both serve investors and advance the public interest by promoting high-quality and accurate financial statements.</p>
<p>Relatedly, the ability to attract and retain young professionals is crucial to the future of the audit profession. Incorporating the use of analytical tools can further those goals so that professionals are not stuck using outmoded methodologies or bogged down in unnecessarily time-consuming processes. I hope that the amendments also facilitate progress on this important front.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the board members and staff of the PCAOB, and the staff within the Office of the Chief Accountant and all others at the SEC who contributed to today&rsquo;s meeting and the matters we considered.</p>

<title>Opening Statement On Auditing Standards And Rules, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-statement-on-auditing-standards-and-rules-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-statement-on-auditing-standards-and-rules-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. I want to welcome members of the public to this open meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Today, the Commission will consider three matters geared to enhance the practice of auditing.</p>
<p>Well-functioning financial markets are built on trust. Critical to such trust are disclosures&mdash;including financial statement disclosures that issuers and broker-dealers make to the investing public.</p>
<p>Long before the SEC was established, in 1889, the first U.S. Commissioner of Labor, Carroll D. Wright, who happened to also be a statistician, spoke to a convention of labor statistics commissioners in Hartford, Connecticut.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-standards-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>He warned about the erosion of trust and the abuse of numbers for personal gain. &ldquo;Figures will not lie,&rdquo; he said, but &ldquo;liars will figure.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-standards-082024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>My grandfather Ellis Tilles, an immigrant from Lithuania who ran a corner grocery store, so not a statistician, often said the same thing: &ldquo;Figures don&rsquo;t lie, but liars sure can figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having watched the run-up and aftermath of the calamitous 1929 stock market crash, Congress and President Roosevelt understood the wise words of Commissioner Wright and my grandpa. In response, they worked to restore trust among the investing public by enacting the first federal securities laws.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 years later, however, our system was once again breaking down. Fraud in financial reporting and accounting eventually led to historic bankruptcies, such as Enron and WorldCom.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-standards-082024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Investors needed facts and figures they could trust &mdash; figures without the liars.</p>
<p>Congress responded by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-standards-082024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Having had a ringside seat advising my home state senator, Paul Sarbanes, on this historic legislation, I saw how both Congressman Mike Oxley and he understood all too well the importance of figures.</p>
<p>Their vision led to reforms establishing the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) as an independent watchdog over the audits of public companies and registered broker-dealers and their auditors.</p>
<p>The Enron crisis revealed a key problem: the quality of auditing standards.</p>
<p>Candidly, the relationships between issuers and auditors, between standard-setters and auditing firms, were too clubby.</p>
<p>Auditing standards were set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), a professional association. The profession was writing its own rules. That&rsquo;s an inherent conflict.</p>
<p>To correct course, the PCAOB was tasked with setting enhanced auditing standards. For practical purposes, Congress permitted the newly established PCAOB to carry over existing AICPA standards on an interim basis. The expectation was that the Board would produce a more appropriate set of standards going forward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that many of these standards were already decades-old when the Board adopted them in 2003.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-standards-082024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Many contained inherent flaws that the Board was created to solve.</p>
<p>Since then, the AICPA itself has updated numerous standards in the private company audit space.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-standards-082024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The PCAOB, however, has not done likewise. In fact, 42 of these 49 so-called &ldquo;interim standards&rdquo; remained in public company audit practice when I came to the SEC. Without pre-judging any one of them, adhering to 20<span>th</span>-century standards is not a faithful effort towards instilling greater trust among today&rsquo;s investors.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years after Sarbanes-Oxley, I have the honor of serving as Chair of this great agency. I&rsquo;m proud to support the PCAOB&rsquo;s proposed changes to instill greater trust among investors and issuers in our markets.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the staff and Board members of the PCAOB for their diligent work on these matters. I also want to thank the staff at the SEC for their work in preparing today&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing these recommendations from the staff.</p>

<title>SEC Approves New And Updated PCAOB Audit Standards And An Amendment To The PCAOB’s Contributory Liability Rule - Changes Address General Responsibilities Of An Auditor Conducting An Audit As Well As Technology-Assisted Analysis And Contributory Liability Rule For Associated Persons</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-new-and-updated-pcaob-audit-standards-and-an-amendment-to-the-pcaob/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-new-and-updated-pcaob-audit-standards-and-an-amendment-to-the-pcaob/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has approved two Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) proposals updating audit standards regarding general responsibilities of the auditor and use of technology-assisted analysis in conducting an audit. The SEC also approved a proposal amending a PCAOB ethics rule governing the liability of an associated person when they directly and substantially contribute to audit firm violations.</p>
<p>The Commission approved the PCAOB&rsquo;s new AS 1000,&nbsp;<em>General Responsibilities of the Auditor in Conducting an Audit</em>, along with related amendments to other PCAOB standards, to reaffirm, consolidate, and modernize the general principles and responsibilities of the auditor when conducting an audit. These standards cover such foundational topics as affirming the auditor&rsquo;s duty to protect investors through the preparation and issuance of informative, accurate, and independent auditor&rsquo;s reports; the exercise of due professional care, professional skepticism, and professional judgment when performing audits; and compliance with ethics and independence rules.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission approved the PCAOB&rsquo;s amendments to AS 1105,&nbsp;<em>Audit Evidence</em>, and AS 2301,&nbsp;<em>The Auditor&rsquo;s Response to the Risks of Material Misstatement</em>, and conforming amendments, to address the use of technology-assisted data analysis in audit procedures. The amendments specify and clarify auditors&rsquo; responsibilities when the auditor uses such analytical tools in conducting audits.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission approved the PCAOB&rsquo;s amendment to Rule 3502,&nbsp;<em>Responsibility Not to Knowingly or Recklessly Contribute to Violations</em>, governing the liability of an associated person of a registered public accounting firm who directly and substantially contributes to that firm&rsquo;s violations of the laws, rules, and standards that the PCAOB enforces. The amendments to Rule 3502 revise from recklessness to negligence the standard for an associated person&rsquo;s contributory liability, while maintaining the requirement that to be held liable, an associated person must have contributed to the firm&rsquo;s violation &ldquo;directly and substantially.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased that the PCAOB is fulfilling its obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by updating its standards and rules regarding the practice of auditing,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to support the PCAOB&rsquo;s proposed changes to instill greater trust among investors and issuers in our markets.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter said, &ldquo;The amendments to Rule 3502 are critical because moving the PCAOB contributory liability standard from recklessness to negligence aligns the rule with other negligence-based professional conduct standards, including the standard for sanctions by the Commission for individuals negligently contributing to firm violations as well as certain state professional licensing requirements, that have long governed the accounting profession, and aligns the rule with the same standard of reasonable care that auditors are required to exercise when executing their professional duties. The PCAOB&rsquo;s new standard regarding auditor responsibilities and the amendments to other PCAOB audit standards related to the use of technology will support high-quality audits and protect investors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amendments to Rule 3502 will become effective in 60 days. The amendment does not apply to conduct before the effective date.</p>
<p>AS 1000, and other related amendments to PCAOB standards, will take effect for audits of financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after Dec. 15, 2024; however, for firms that provide audit opinions for 100 or fewer issuers during the calendar year ending Dec. 31, 2024, the amendment related to the documentation completion date requirement will take effect for audits of financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after Dec. 15, 2025.</p>
<p>The amendments to AS 1105 and AS 2301, and conforming amendments, will take effect for audits of financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after Dec. 15, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>I am happy to be here today to discuss three important rules coming out of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;). The work of auditors is crucial to investor confidence in the market. Auditors are external accountants that provide the public with assurance that a company&rsquo;s financial statements, and the controls that produce those statements, are reliable. They exercise due professional care, skepticism, and are subject to independence requirements to mitigate conflicts of interest&mdash;conflicts that exist by virtue of clients paying them to conduct audits. Because the work of auditors is such an important cornerstone of market confidence and integrity, it is equally important that we have in place a meaningful system of rules and regulations for the audit profession. Without such rules, the accuracy and reliability of financial statements would disintegrate &ndash; eroding with it investor trust in our entire market. The PCAOB, with its specialized expertise, independently oversees that system of rules, and in so doing, also provides a crucial market function.</p>
<p>Today, the Commission will vote on three matters. In reaching this stage in each matter, the PCAOB has: engaged stakeholders and its investor advisory groups, issued proposing and adopting releases, held an open comment period, reviewed and incorporated comments received, and explained thoroughly the rationales for these actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;As part of&nbsp;<i>our&nbsp;</i>statutory oversight function,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>SEC staff&nbsp;</i>has reviewed each of these matters, held an additional<i>&nbsp;</i>comment period, and provided us with their recommendations following in-depth consideration of comments submitted. These rules and standards are the product of a strong and robust process, and I am thankful to the staff at the SEC and the PCAOB for their hard work and dedication, and to the members of the public who have provided their input. The end result benefits from this iterative process and engagement.</p>
<p>The first of the three matters on the agenda today concerns the PCAOB&rsquo;s amendments to its contributory liability rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The PCAOB proposed and then adopted an amendment to its rule governing an individual auditor&rsquo;s ethical obligations to act in accordance with laws, rules, and standards and to not contribute to violations of those requirements when conducting an audit under PCAOB standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The amendment aligns the standard of accountability for an individual auditor with the standard applied to audit firms.</p>
<p>Currently, the relevant rule requires a showing of&nbsp;<i>recklessness&nbsp;</i>for an individual to be held liable for a registered firm&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>negligent&nbsp;</i>conduct.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Recklessness requires a showing of an&nbsp;<i>extreme&nbsp;</i>departure from the standard of ordinary care.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;However, as we all know, an audit firm does not act unless the people within it do so. Therefore, the current formulation means that even though a person&rsquo;s action could contribute &ndash; even in large part &ndash; to a firm&rsquo;s negligent conduct, that individual would not necessarily be held liable or subject to sanction by the PCAOB because of the application of the higher standard. The matter before us resolves this incongruity and is informed by years of PCAOB investigation and enforcement experience.<span>7</span></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s rule also eliminates an incongruity in&nbsp;<i>authority</i>. The SEC<i>&nbsp;</i>currently has the ability to bring actions against, and seek remedial relief and penalties from, individuals associated with audit firms who have acted negligently, while the PCAOB currently does not.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The difference in the SEC&rsquo;s authority and the PCAOB&rsquo;s authority is also resolved by the passage of today&rsquo;s new rule.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to echo a point made by several of the Board members and Chair Williams &ndash; the amendments do not provide regulators with the ability to play &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; or to supplant the reasonable, if mistaken, judgment of the auditor. Rather, by employing a negligence standard, the PCAOB will be required to make a showing that an individual did not exercise&nbsp;<i>reasonable care.&nbsp;</i>An auditor would have to act&nbsp;<i>unreasonably</i>&nbsp;and then also directly and substantially contribute to the firm&rsquo;s violation in order to be held liable under these standards. Junior professionals or other auditors who are executing their responsibilities in good faith and with due care would not incur liability under this amended rule and the PCAOB underscored this in its Adopting Release.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-pcaob-liability-082024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>I want to thank all of those who worked on the rule. The process and the rules and standards that result from it represent thousands of hours worked and a tireless effort from many dedicated public servants. Thank you to the Office of the Chief Accountant, the members of the PCAOB and its staff, and the members of the public who participated in this process.</p>

<title>Statement On General Responsibilities Of Auditors, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Aug. 20, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-general-responsibilities-of-auditors-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-general-responsibilities-of-auditors-sec-chair-gary-gensler-washi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering whether to approve the final standard and related amendments updating the general responsibilities of auditors when conducting an audit. I am pleased to vote in support of approving this final standard because it would modernize and streamline the core obligations required of auditors.</p>
<p>Currently, auditors are held to a set of foundational standards, such as: due professional care, professional skepticism, independence, competence, reasonable assurance, and professional judgment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>These obligations exist to protect investors. They are the building blocks of an independent audit and are central to investors&rsquo; trust in our markets.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger noted the importance of the public&rsquo;s confidence in the independent auditing process. In&nbsp;<i>United States v. Arthur Young &amp; Company,&nbsp;</i>he wrote, it is &ldquo;not enough that financial statements&nbsp;<i>be&nbsp;</i>accurate; the public must also&nbsp;<i>perceive&nbsp;</i>them as being accurate.&rdquo; Further, &ldquo;public faith in the reliability of a corporation's financial statements depends upon the public perception of the outside auditor as an independent professional.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Investors need credible, high-quality information when making investment decisions. The quality of such information depends not only on the companies that provide it, but the integrity of the auditors who audited it.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed standard would replace five interim standards, which were originally developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) decades ago and adopted on an interim basis by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in 2003.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;To put this in perspective, some of these standards were the same back when I took, and later taught, undergraduate-level accounting at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Since then, technological advancements have introduced new auditing tools and software. The requirements related to risk assessment and independence have changed. Today's audits are not the paper-and-pencil audits of 50 years ago, and the profession should have a standard that reflects today&rsquo;s digital reality.</p>
<p>This proposed standard, AS 1000, would modernize and streamline the general principles and responsibilities of auditors. Doing so makes it easier for auditors to understand, apply, and fulfill their duties to investors.</p>
<p>In addition, the proposed standard would update the auditor&rsquo;s objective to cover both a financial statements audit, as well as an audit of internal control over financial reporting. More explicitly, it would tie the auditor&rsquo;s independence obligations to PCAOB and SEC independence rules.</p>
<p>Audit engagement partners have a responsibility to act with due professional care. Importantly, the proposed standard would clarify the engagement partner&rsquo;s existing responsibilities for supervision and review of the engagement.</p>
<p>The proposed standard also clarifies the meaning of the term, &ldquo;presents fairly.&rdquo; Today, &ldquo;presents fairly&rdquo; is a reference to preparing financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pcaob-responsibilities-082024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The revision would change this reference to preparing financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This change also emphasizes that the auditor&rsquo;s evaluation of fair presentation extends beyond a technical compliance exercise and requires professional judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, it would also accelerate the deadline to assemble a complete and final set of audit documentation for retention from 45 days to 14 days. As we all know, memories fade, and likely so does the quality of documents assembled too long after the work is done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to support the approval of these updates to the core responsibilities of auditors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on this proposal, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Munter, Natasha Guinan, Anita Doutt, Shaz Niazi, Greg Hillson, Mark Jacoby, Mai-Khoi Nguyen-Thanh, Fariba Nasary, Keith Hooper, Taylor Pross, Jeanne Riggs, and Dana Cretu in the Office of the Chief Accountant.</li>
<li>Megan Barbero, Bryant Morris, Peggy Kim, Eduardo Aleman, and Hillary Holman in the Office of the General Counsel.</li>
<li>Jessica Wachter, Lauren Moore, Oliver Richard, Charles Woodworth, Lyndon Orton, Tara Bhandari, Olga Itenberg, Vladimir Ivanov, Mahdi Mohseni, Rebecca Orban, Albert Sheen, and Mengxin Zhao in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.</li>

Summary:<br /><br />The Dubai AI & Web3 Festival, organized by Dubai AI Campus, aims to reinforce Dubai's position as a pioneer in the global digital economy and AI. The festival will feature key themes, industry leaders, and a startup pitch competition. <div>

<div> imposed fine, misleading conduct, prohibited from holding office, inadequate AML systems, Chief Executive comment
Summary:
Peter Georgiou fined for misleading conduct, prohibited from financial services, involved in AML breaches, DFSA imposes strong sanctions. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has imposed a fine of USD 980,020 (AED 3,599,613), after settlement discount, on Mr Peter Georgiou, for misleading and deceptive conduct and for being knowingly involved in breaches of DFSA rules by his former employer Mirabaud (Middle East) Limited (MMEL). Mr Georgiou was employed by MMEL as a private banker.</p>
<p>In addition to the financial penalty, the DFSA has prohibited Mr Georgiou from holding office or being an employee of a DFSA Authorised Firm. He is also restricted from performing any function in connection with the provision of financial services in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).</p>
<p>The DFSA determined that Mr Georgiou lacked integrity and is not fit and proper to be involved in the provision of financial services in or from the DIFC. In particular, the DFSA found that Mr Georgiou:</p>
<ul>
<li>knowingly provided misleading information to MMEL&rsquo;s compliance team and withheld relevant information in order to circumvent MMEL&rsquo;s anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls;</li>
<li>knowingly sent a forged deceptive and misleading email to a client; and</li>
<li>provided false, misleading, or deceptive information to the DFSA during an interview.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 2023, the DFSA fined MMEL USD 3 million for inadequate AML systems and controls. Mr Georgiou was also found to be knowingly involved in MMEL&rsquo;s failure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>conduct due diligence on existing customers at appropriate times, particularly when there was doubt about the veracity and adequacy of provided documents or suspicion of money laundering; and</li>
<li>perform adequate assessment of clients&rsquo; financial markets experience when classifying them as Professional Clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ian Johnston, Chief Executive of the DFSA, commented, saying:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The DFSA expects those working in financial services within the DIFC to comply with the DFSA&rsquo;s AML rules. We also expect firms and individuals to engage with the DFSA in an open and honest manner, and to uphold the highest standards of integrity. The DFSA remains committed to holding those who fail to meet these expectations to account. The sanctions imposed on Mr Georgiou reflect the severity of his misconduct and serve as a strong warning to others who may consider engaging in similar behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A copy of the DFSA's Decision Notice can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/what-we-do/enforcement/regulatory-actions" target="_blank">Regulatory Actions section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA website.</p>

<div> NGX Regulation Limited, Olufemi Shobanjo, Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria, sustainability reporting, International Sustainability Standards Board<br />
Summary:<br />
Nigeria adopts ISSB standards, FRCN's proactive role, potential benefits, readiness of listed companies, NGX RegCo's support. <div>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of NGX Regulation Limited (&ldquo;NGX RegCo&rdquo;),&nbsp;Mr. Olufemi Shobanjo,&nbsp;has commended the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN) for its pioneering role in advancing sustainability reporting standards across the African continent.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Regulatory Roundtable for Sustainability Reporting in Nigeria,&nbsp;hosted by FRCN recently in Abuja,&nbsp;Shobanjo&nbsp;commended&nbsp;the FRCN's proactive approach and leadership in driving sustainability education and adoption of sustainability financial reporting standards. "The FRCN has demonstrated remarkable foresight and commitment to corporate transparency and sustainable business practices," Shobanjo remarked.</p>
<p>The commendation comes in light of Nigeria's groundbreaking move in June 2023, when it became the first African nation to adopt the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards. This initiative saw the introduction of IFRS S1 and S2, which focus on sustainability and climate disclosures respectively.</p>
<p>According to him, the potential long-term benefits of this adoption, include increased investor confidence, improved corporate governance, and enhanced comparability of sustainability information across different markets.</p>
<p>He emphasized the significance of this achievement, stating, "By taking this bold step, the FRCN has not only positioned Nigeria as a leader in corporate reporting but has also set a benchmark for other African nations to follow.</p>
<p>Shobanjo highlighted some significant developments, including NGX RegCo&rsquo;s collaboration with ISSB and FRCN to assess the readiness of listed companies and the rollout of a phased roadmap for standard adoption set for March 2024. He noted that companies such as Seplat Energy and MTN Nigeria have already integrated these standards into their financial reporting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This roundtable is designed to equip stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the roadmap and compliance requirements, fostering transparency and sustainability,&rdquo; Shobanjo said. He encouraged attendees to use the insights from the event to effectively navigate the new reporting standards.</p>
<p>He concluded with NGX RegCo reaffirming its commitment to support the FRCN and other regulatory bodies in the ongoing implementation and refinement of these sustainability reporting standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Trustly partners with food delivery service to offer new payment solution in Finland and other European markets, improving efficiency and security.
<br /><br />Summary: Trustly partners with food delivery service to offer new payment solution in Finland and other European markets, improving efficiency and security. <div>
<p>Trustly, the global leader in open banking, today announces a strategic partnership with<b>&nbsp;</b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.foodora.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">foodora,</a>&nbsp;a leading food delivery service. This collaboration will introduce an innovative new checkout service option for foodora customers. The new payment solution will be initially launched in Finland, with imminent plans for expansion into other European markets, including Norway, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Austria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its cutting-edge technology allows foodora customers to pay for food orders directly from their bank without requiring a credit or debit card. These customers will benefit from a smoother, and hassle-free payment process, ensuring quicker and more efficient purchases. The efficiency and reliability of Trustly&rsquo;s technology can lead to higher customer satisfaction and more successful transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The payment solution offers several advantages, including reduced transaction costs for foodora and quicker payment processing for partners. By offering Trustly as a preferred payment method, restaurants and shops on foodora can potentially expect a rise in conversion due to the streamlined payment process. They will also benefit from Trustly&rsquo;s unique collection model, which facilitates the fastest possible settlement, reduces fraud, and remits instant customer payouts for refunds or reimbursements, giving greater flexibility as a payment system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trustly&rsquo;s technology integrates seamlessly and operates with the utmost security, safeguarding customer data while enhancing their payment experience. It further bolsters security by encrypting data in transit and ensuring that customer banking details are never stored.</p>
<p><b>Herbert Haas, Chief International Officer Europe at foodora said:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;We chose to partner with Trustly as its cutting-edge open banking payment solution aligns perfectly with foodora&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and to improve the customer experience. Trustly&rsquo;s technology offers a seamless alternative to traditional card payments, which not only improves the efficiency of transactions for our customers but also has the potential to increase conversion for our partners.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Jussi Lindberg, Chief Revenue Officer at Trustly commented:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;We are excited to bring Trustly&rsquo;s open banking payment solution to foodora&rsquo;s platform.

<p><span><span>Merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity in the pharmaceutical contract manufacturing industry declined in 2023 compared to 2021-22.

<p><span><span>GlobalData&rsquo;s analysis found that&nbsp;</span><span>high-value deals are altering</span><span>&nbsp;the competitive balance between CMOs, and this activity is continuing into 2024. Earlier this year, Catalent Inc announced that it will be acquired by Novo Holdings A/S, the owner of Novo Nordisk, for $16.5 billion. The news shocked the industry. Mergers of this scale may have the potential anticompetitive effects and affect capacity in the CMO industry.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bradbury</span><span>&nbsp;concludes: &ldquo;Acquirers were seeking multi-service companies and facilities in 2023. Most targets also had injectable capabilities. Although demand from COVID-19 vaccines is no longer contributing to the growth of injectable demand, the demand for obesity treatments targeting GLP-1 is a major provider of growth to this segment. The need for commercial production for biologics generally remains high, as an ever-increasing number gain market approval.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<div> partnership, cloud computing, financial markets, expansion, infrastructure<br />
Summary:<br />
Beeks Group expands partnership with JSE and IPC to enhance Colo 2.0 with dual location disaster recovery, enabling agile and resilient cloud-based financial market infrastructure. <div>
<p>Beeks Group, a leading cloud computing and connectivity provider for financial markets, has announced a significant expansion of its partnership with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and IPC Systems. This extension will see Beeks&rsquo; Exchange Cloud service deployed at the JSE's Teraco data centre, bolstering the exchange's Colo 2.0 offering with enhanced dual location disaster recovery capabilities.</p>
<p>JSE's Colo 2.0 is an advanced managed infrastructure as a service powered by Beeks&rsquo; Exchange Cloud, in collaboration with IPC, a leading provider of electronic trading solutions. The service provides JSE customers with innovative hosting and connectivity solutions, accessing on-demand private cloud computing and low latency analytics. With the new integration at Teraco, Colo 2.0 not only enhances redundancy to meet the regulatory demands of large financial institutions but also exemplifies the operational agility that Beeks&rsquo; solutions and industry collaboration bring to market infrastructure.</p>
<p>This expansion is a testament to the agility and scalability of Beeks&rsquo; Exchange Cloud, and IPC&rsquo;s data centre presence/fully hosted IaaS data centre solutions, enabling the JSE to quickly respond to market demands and regulatory requirements. By seamlessly scaling operations to include a secondary data centre, the JSE ensures that its infrastructure remains robust, resilient, and capable of adapting to the evolving needs of its customers.</p>
<p>The expansion builds on the successful launch of Colo 2.0 in September 2023 and follows a significant contract extension in March 2024 driven by higher-than-expected demand from the financial sector.</p>
<h4>Significant Customer Adoption</h4>
<p>Tebalo Tsoaeli, Chief Innovation Officer at the JSE, highlighted the strong uptake of the Colo 2.0 service since its introduction, noting the additional demand for a secondary solution that addresses redundancy and disaster recovery needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the launch of Colo 2.0 in September 2023, JSE has seen significant adoption of the Colo 2.0 service by customers, demonstrating a clear demand for the product offering. This has resulted in additional demand for a secondary solution aimed at addressing the redundancy and Disaster Recovery requirements of existing customers. Through our partnership with Beeks and IPC, JSE seeks to power a truly cloud-based marketplace infrastructure that is modern, hyper-scalable, ultra-resilient, highly performant, and accessible to all market participants,&rdquo; said Tsoaeli.</p>
<h4>Supporting Global Market Demand</h4>

Exchange Cloud continues to be a unique offering in the market, and the success of the solution at the JSE is supporting our discussions with other global exchanges, underpinning our confidence in continued momentum,&rdquo; McArthur stated.</p>
<h4>Market Impact and Future Outlook</h4>
<p>Beeks&rsquo; collaboration with the JSE and IPC exemplifies the growing trend towards cloud-based solutions in financial markets, particularly in regions like Africa where digital infrastructure is rapidly evolving. By leveraging the operational agility and collective power of Beeks&rsquo; and IPC&rsquo;s solutions, the JSE can swiftly adapt to changing market conditions, ensuring continuous high performance and resilience. This partnership underscores Beeks' role as a thought leader in the space, delivering innovative technology solutions that drive the future of financial market infrastructure.</p>
<p>As financial markets continue to prioritise security, scalability, and performance, Beeks remains at the forefront of delivering solutions that address these critical needs, positioning itself as a key player in the future of financial market infrastructure.</p>

<title>The World Federation Of Exchanges Makes Recommendations For US Treasury AI Regulatory Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Industry association, AI regulation, financial services, innovation, regulatory framework<br />
Summary:<br />
- WFE calls for AI regulation enhancements in financial services to protect investors and promote innovation. Principles-based approach, balanced with protection and innovation. <div>
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and central clearing counterparties, has called for enhancements to legislative, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks applicable to AI in financial services.&nbsp;<br /><br />The WFE, which today published its response to the US Treasury&rsquo;s consultation on the uses of AI in the financial services sector, said there are valid concerns about the uncertainties surrounding the evolving landscape of AI technologies, which require a close look at regulation in order to protect investors and other market participants. However, the WFE recommended the Treasury seek an appropriate balance between innovation and protection to ensure that the regulatory framework isn&rsquo;t too broad, too complex and that there is cohesion and alignment amongst regulators and international standard setters.&nbsp;<br /><br />If the US framework introduced fails to meet this, the benefits that AI brings to economic growth, productivity, automation and innovation will be at risk.<br /><br />On behalf of the exchange and clearing industry, representing the providers of over 250 market infrastructures, that see more than $124tr in trading pass through them annually (at end-2023), the WFE advises the Treasury that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of AI should be precisely tailored to avoid including more than what is necessary. A broad definition would create onerous restrictions and not be proportionate to the risks that different tools have.</li>
<li>A definition of AI should focus on computer systems with the ability to make decisions or predictions based on automated, statistical learning.</li>
<li>AI deployment by malicious actors is an emerging type of risk associated with this technology which financial services firms are well aware of and are tackling.</li>
<li>Whilst traditional risk management techniques can be used to manage risk of AI systems, more work needs to be done to develop AI specific risk management tools.</li>
<li>Third parties will be valuable to help develop AI tools and risk management tools, but Treasury is right to be cognisant of the risks around big tech firms utilising their market dominance.</li>
<li>Regulatory uncertainty is a key concern amongst our members. Regulators should focus on outcomes and use sound judgment, fostering collaboration to support innovation and competitiveness in financial markets.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Our members favour a principles and risk-based approach to developing a regulatory framework, where requirements are proportional to the level of risk associated with AI applications. This needs alignment among the various financial regulators and must be compliant with international standards.</li>
<li>Ultimately, government policy should encourage modernisation by promoting the use of cutting-edge technologies like AI, cloud computing, and machine learning in capital markets. This enhances market dynamics, and provides better services to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nandini Sukumar, Chief Executive Officer, at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;AI regulation must enhance protection whilst avoiding the curtailment of progress and modernisation. The definition of AI in the President&rsquo;s Executive Order is overly broad and could create unnecessary complexity by imposing extensive compliance obligations if implemented for financial services. Policy should establish the appropriate safeguards and supervision, but it must also encourage innovation and promote the use of cutting-edge technologies, like AI. It&rsquo;s through this that we can drive efficiency, enhance market dynamics and provide better services to consumers.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;While these technological innovations and the associated concerns about managing generative AI are significant, it is important to remember that, as trusted third parties providing secure and regulated platforms for trading securities, our members are already carefully scrutinising tools and establishing controls to govern AI use. The US Treasury should therefore take care to design an AI regulatory framework which is principles based, to maintain flexibility and encourage innovation. We also need to have an incremental approach to AI regulation, allowing for gradual adjustments and learning, ensuring that regulations do not hinder technological progress.&rdquo;<br /><br />The full response and policy recommendations can be found&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=f21f8bf79a&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<title>KB Asset Management To Launch KB RISE Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus ETF Tracking The Solactive Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus Index</title>

<div> Collaboration, KB Asset Management, Japan, Solactive, ETF
Summary:<br /><br />Solactive collaborates with KB Asset Management to offer the KB RISE Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus ETF, providing strategic exposure to high-performing sectors in the resilient Japanese equity market. <div>
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to expand its collaboration with KB Asset Management. The KB RISE Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus ETF aims to track the Solactive Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus Index, offering investors strategic exposure to leading Japanese securities across a range of high-performing sectors.</strong></p>
<p>The Japanese equity market continues to show resilient performance driven by strong earnings growth, technological advances, and robust economic policies. Owing to favorable macroeconomic conditions and supportive government policies, Japan&rsquo;s economy has experienced moderate recovery and the return of sustainable inflation after years of stagnation, which allows companies to raise prices and improve profit margins. Moreover, against the backdrop of current economic and corporate governance reforms<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/kb-asset-management-to-launch-kb-rise-japan-samurai-sector-top4-plus-etf-tracking-the-solactive-japan-samurai-sector-top4-plus-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>, there has been an increased focus on the efficient use of capital and profitability by Japanese corporations. This can further improve optimism about Japanese investment markets.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0HY07">Solactive Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus Index</a>&nbsp;tracks the performance of the four leading sectors and other outstanding companies in Japan. The top four sectors are selected based on their growth and momentum factors to ensure that only the most dynamic and high-potential large-to-mid-cap companies are included. These leading sectors can make up to 80% of the index, allowing investors to gain concentrated exposure to potential high-upside industries. While the index aims to select four stocks per leading sector to increase further diversification, the remaining weight is composed of the top-ranked stocks by free-float market capitalization in sectors other than the leading four. Final index constituents are then also weighted by free-float market capitalization.</p>
<p><strong>The KB RISE Japan Samurai Sector TOP4 Plus ETF listed on 20th August 2024 on the Korea Stock Exchange with the ticker code 488480. KS.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:<em>&ldquo;We are delighted to extend our relationship with KB Asset Management. This partnership allows investors to capitalize on the growth potential of Japan&rsquo;s leading sectors that benefited from structural reforms and accommodative policies. By adopting a flexible high-conviction approach, it enables us to draw from a spectrum of investment opportunities in the Japanese equity market. Furthermore, implementing such an innovative approach also reinforces our commitment to meeting the evolving needs of global investors.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soojin Lee, Head of ETF Product Division at KB Asset Management commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>We are now able to offer a wider range of investment opportunities in Japanese equities, which were previously limited to benchmark indices and semiconductor themes in the Korean ETF market. With the RISE Japan Sector TOP4Plus ETF, investors can seize long-term investment opportunities in Japan&rsquo;s leading sectors and prominent companies poised for growth.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> derivatives, energy, ASX, Wallumbilla Natural Gas Futures, AEMO
Summary:<br />ASX expands energy derivatives market with Wallumbilla Natural Gas Futures, developed with AEMO to manage risk amid clean energy transition. Expanding into gas markets. <div>
<p>ASX has expanded its energy derivatives market presence, listing the physically settled Wallumbilla Natural Gas Futures contract for trading this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jointly developed with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the contract is the latest addition to ASX&rsquo;s energy and environmental derivatives ecosystem, helping participants more effectively manage risk amid the transition to clean energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wallumbilla Natural Gas Futures join ASX&rsquo;s existing Electricity Futures, Victorian Gas Futures, and the listing in late July 2024 of three Environmental Futures contracts. All are now available to trade on the ASX24 market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Daniel Sinclair, ASX Head of Commodities</b>, said that market participants globally are increasingly using derivatives to hedge against energy transition risks and more confidently invest in decarbonisation initiatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ASX already offers access to a range of Electricity Futures contracts that enable price discovery and hedging across Australian and New Zealand markets. We&rsquo;ve recently expanded into carbon and renewables trading with the launch of Australian Carbon Credit Unit, New Zealand Unit and Large Generation Certificate Futures. We&rsquo;re embracing our responsibility to develop a derivatives portfolio across a spectrum of transitional energy and environmental markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wallumbilla Natural Gas Futures will support Australia&rsquo;s east coast gas market by providing a transparent, monthly forward price curve out to three years. The Futures contracts are designed to improve liquidity in Wallumbilla&rsquo;s Gas Supply Hub, allowing participants to trade natural gas over a month for physical delivery into the High Pressure Trade Point in the Wallumbilla Gas Supply Hub operated by AEMO.</p>
<p>The launch follows strong demand from market participants for a physically delivered contract to hedge exposure to Australia&rsquo;s main gas supply hub located in southeast Queensland. As a pipeline interconnection point, the hub connects and supplies gas markets in Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, as well as Queensland&rsquo;s LNG export facilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wholesale gas markets play an important role in the clean energy transition that&rsquo;s changing the face of Australian power generation. As we scale renewables and advance our collective net zero ambitions, gas has become more important as a stabiliser within the electricity grid,&rdquo; Mr Sinclair said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alongside AEMO, we&rsquo;re responding to demand from energy generators and retailers, energy-related commodities traders and LNG suppliers for a liquid and transparent derivatives market covering the Wallumbilla Gas Supply Hub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ASX is currently exploring the potential to expand into other domestic regional gas markets through additional futures contracts, pending internal and regulatory approvals.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement Regarding GHS Investments, LLC, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Aug. 19, 2024</title>

<div> enforcement, GHS Investments, LLC, convertible notes, Securities Act, rulemaking
Summary:<br />The author dissents from the SEC's order against GHS for not registering as a dealer and argues for policy objectives through rulemaking instead of enforcement.<br /> <div>
<p>From 2017 through 2022, GHS Investments, LLC (GHS) acquired convertible, variable rate notes from penny stock securities issuers, converted the notes into stock at a substantial discount from the prevailing market price, and sold the resulting shares into the public market to obtain profits. The Commission has issued an order that finds that such activities made GHS a dealer<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;under Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and GHS&rsquo;s failure to register as a dealer violated Section 15(a)(1) of that Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I dissent from this order because it appears that the Commission is attempting to achieve policy objectives through enforcement, instead of rulemaking, while also arbitrarily deciding which activities necessitate enforcement action.</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulation by Enforcement</span></span></p>
<p>Since at least the 1990s, companies have issued convertible, variable rate notes to finance their operations<a name="_Ref174522004">.</a><a name="_Ref174527424"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;When investors, like GHS, convert the notes into the company&rsquo;s common stock and resell the stock, there can a &ldquo;death spiral&rdquo; of the price of the stock.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;However, companies generally issue these notes understanding this risk because they have no other sources of financing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Although the Commission has not publicly expressed it, its enforcement actions suggest policy concerns with investors&rsquo; actions relating to convertible, variable rate notes and such actions&rsquo; impact on the share prices of companies that issue them. However, the appropriate course of action to address these concerns is through rulemaking, not enforcement.</p>
<p>The Commission began a rulemaking process in 2020 when it proposed changes to Rule 144 under the Securities Act to eliminate tacking of holding periods<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;for certain types of convertible, variable rate notes, including those at issue in this case. Without tacking, investors, like GHS, may be required to hold the converted shares for at least six months before selling them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;If that were the case, investors may be discouraged from purchasing notes at the outset because they would be subject to investment risk while holding the underlying common stock after conversion. Thus, if tacking were prohibited, the Commission may achieve its unspoken policy objective regarding convertible, variable rate notes. However, the Commission has yet to take final action on the proposal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Since 2017, the Commission has brought a series of enforcement actions against investors engaged in activities similar to GHS with respect to convertible, variable rate notes. These cases introduced a novel interpretation that such activities meant that investors were &ldquo;dealers&rdquo; and needed to register under the Exchange Act. While the Commission has been successful in some of these actions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;the facts of this case demonstrate why regulation by enforcement is extremely problematic.</p>
<p>Prior to 2017,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;investors in convertible, variable rate notes had no reason to believe that their activity could trigger dealer registration obligations. One might claim that market participants should have been on notice about the Commission&rsquo;s previously undisclosed interpretation of &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; when it filed the first complaint in 2017. However, it is unreasonable to expect market participants to be continuously scanning court dockets in pending litigation across the country for new legal theories from the Commission, and on which a court has never ruled.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>District courts began issuing opinions analyzing the Commission&rsquo;s interpretation of &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; in late 2019 and in 2020.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;However, a court of appeal would not rule on the issue until 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The Supreme Court has recognized &ldquo;[t]he fundamental principle that laws regulating persons or entities must give fair notice of what conduct is required or proscribed.&rdquo;<a name="_Ref174521503"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s action against GHS did not satisfy this principle. As the Commission acknowledges in its order, GHS ceased purchases of new convertible, variable rate notes in 2020, and converted and sold only small amounts of stock from existing inventory after 2020.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;In other words, GHS stopped the conduct in question around the time that the first judicial opinions stating that such conduct triggered dealer registration requirements was issued. In light of this, holding GHS to a standard not articulated until after its conduct occurred is fundamentally unfair.</p>
<p>The Commission should not be implementing policy objectives for convertible, variable rate notes through enforcement of novel theories under the &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; definition. Instead, the Commission should achieve its objectives through the rulemaking process, such as its proposal to change Rule 144&rsquo;s tacking requirements.</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arbitrary Enforcement</span></span></p>
<p>Under the Commission&rsquo;s broad definition of &ldquo;dealer,&rdquo; nearly any activity that involves buying and selling securities outside of the trader exception could require registration under the Exchange Act. Yet the action against GHS is solely focused on its transactions involving convertible, variable rate notes.</p>
<p>In addition to notes, GHS also acquired shares of common stock at a discounted price pursuant to equity lines of credit and then sought to resell them at prevailing market prices pursuant to registration statements under the Securities Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>However, the Commission&rsquo;s order makes no mention of the common stock obtained through these equity lines of credit. Instead, the Commission appears to make an arbitrary decision that transactions involving convertible, variable rate notes should be subject to different &ndash; and harsher &ndash; regulatory treatment.</p>
<p>Why does the acquisition and resale of stock from convertible, variable-rate notes require GHS to register as a dealer while the acquisition and resale of discounted stock from equity lines of credit raise no such registration requirements? Is it because issuances of such notes, which are often made as last-ditch financing by near-bankrupt companies, implicate the Commission&rsquo;s unspoken policy concerns but issuances of common stock may not? Unfortunately, the order is silent on this question.</p>
<p>Singling out of notes transactions as requiring dealer registration appears to be an arbitrary application of the &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; definition. This type of arbitrary implementation was a concern to the Supreme Court when it overturned the&nbsp;<i>Chevron</i>&nbsp;doctrine in&nbsp;<i>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</i>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;As Justice Gorsuch explained in his concurring opinion, &ldquo;because the reasonable bureaucrat may change his mind year-to-year and election-to-election, the people can never know with certainty what new &lsquo;interpretations&rsquo; might be used against them.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Actions like the one the Commission takes today invite heightened judicial scrutiny of the Commission&rsquo;s interpretation of the term &ldquo;dealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s actions also further raise questions as to whether its implementation of the &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; definition under the Exchange Act should be analyzed under the Supreme Court&rsquo;s &ldquo;void for vagueness&rdquo; doctrine, which &ldquo;addresses at least two connected but discrete due process concerns: first, that regulated parties should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly; second, precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Under the Commission&rsquo;s current interpretation of the &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; definition, parties cannot know what is required of them, and the Commission&rsquo;s lack of precision enables enforcement actions to be undertaken in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></span></p>
<p>In enforcing the federal securities laws, the Commission has an obligation to express its views prospectively,&nbsp;<i>ex ante</i>, to provide fair notice to persons of the conduct that will run afoul of the law. The Commission has failed to do so in this action against GHS.</p>

<div id="ftn1">
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Section 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act defines the term &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities . . . for such person&rsquo;s own account through a broker or otherwise.&rdquo; 15 U.S.C. &sect; 78c(a)(5)(A). The definition excludes &ldquo;a person that buys or sells securities&hellip;for such person&rsquo;s own account, either individually or in a fiduciary capacity, but not as a part of a regular business,&rdquo; which is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;trader exception.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;15 U.S.C. &sect; 78c(a)(5)(B).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Commission adopted a definition of the term &ldquo;as a part of a regular business&rdquo; as used within the Exchange Act&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;dealer.&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>See</i>&nbsp;Further Definition of &ldquo;As a Part of a Regular Business&rdquo; in the Definition of Dealer and Government Securities Dealer in Connection with Certain Liquidity Providers, Release No. 34-99477 (Feb. 6, 2024) [89 FR 14938 (Feb. 29, 2024)] (&ldquo;Dealer Definition Release&rdquo;), available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-02-29/pdf/2024-02837.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-02-29/pdf/2024-02837.pdf</a>. For my views on this rulemaking, see Statement on Further Definition of &ldquo;As a Part of a Regular Business&rdquo; in the Definition of Dealer, Mark T.

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-ghs-investments#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Tacking refers to combining the holding period of the underlying common stock with the holding period of the convertible notes, to satisfy Rule 144&rsquo;s holding period requirement. Tacking is generally permitted under Rule 144 when notes are convertible for the underlying common stock because the holder of the notes is subject to investment risk in the underlying common stock during the pre-conversion period. However, when the conversion rate is at a substantial discount to the market price of the common stock, it is questionable whether this investment risk exists during the pre-conversion period. Typically, when investors such as GHS rely on Rule 144 to sell converted common stock, they satisfy the rule&rsquo;s holding period requirement solely through their holding period of the notes, and accordingly, they can sell the underlying common stock immediately upon conversion.&nbsp;<i>See</i>, generally, the Rule 144 Release<i>&nbsp;supra</i>&nbsp;note 3.</p>

<div> Michigan, Obra Capital, investment, pay-to-play rule, political contribution <br />
Bob's contribution to a Michigan government official led to employment at Obra Capital, resulting in a violation of the pay-to-play rule. The rule imposes costs and restricts political contributions. <br /><br />Summary: The pay-to-play rule resulted in unexpected costs for Obra Capital due to an employee's political contribution and subsequent employment. Political contributions may be restricted. <div>
<p>Sometimes heeding the advice of your high school civics teacher to get involved in the political process and support your preferred candidate carries unexpected costs imposed from unanticipated quarters. Today&rsquo;s settlement with Obra Capital Management, LLC<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;is yet another reminder that when it comes to participation in the political process by means of contributions to preferred candidates, investment advisers, their associated persons, and anyone who might be looking for a job at an investment adviser always should expect the Commission&rsquo;s inquisition.</p>
<p>In December 2019, &ldquo;an individual&rdquo;&mdash;for ease of reference, we shall call him Bob&mdash;contributed $7,150 to a Michigan government official. According to the Order Instituting Proceedings (&ldquo;OIP&rdquo;), &ldquo;the office of the government official had the ability to influence the hiring of investment advisers&rdquo; through appointments to the Michigan Investment Board. When Bob made this contribution, the Michigan Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement Fund, which was subject to the influence of the Michigan Investment Board, was approximately two years in on an investment in a private, closed-end fund advised by Obra Capital. The Michigan pension fund &ldquo;was not able to increase or withdraw its investment from the [closed-end] Fund.&rdquo; In July 2020&mdash;about three years after that investment and just more than six months after his political contribution&mdash;&ldquo;Obra Capital hired [Bob] into a position in which [he] was a covered associate of Obra Capital.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Then, &ldquo;[b]etween September 2020 and May 2021, [Bob] solicited government entities for Obra Capital by attending and participating in meetings and presentations with government entities who were invested or solicited to invest in funds advised by Obra Capital.&rdquo; According to the OIP, Bob&rsquo;s participation in soliciting government entities triggered the two-year lookback provision, which captures not only contributions by persons who are covered associates at the time of the contribution, but also contributions by &ldquo;a person who becomes a covered associate within two years after the contribution is made.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;With the two-year lookback triggered, Obra Capital ran afoul of the pay-to-play rule because it continued to receive investment advisory fees from the Michigan Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement Fund&rsquo;s longstanding investment in the closed-end fund after Bob solicited government entities.</p>
<p>Especially notable is what the Order does not say. It states that Bob &ldquo;solicited&nbsp;<i>government</i>&nbsp;entities.&rdquo; It does not state that he solicited any&nbsp;<i>Michigan</i>&nbsp;government entities. Once Bob was a covered associate who solicited any government entity, his prior contribution to the covered Michigan government official meant that Obra Capital could not receive fees related to the Michigan pension fund&rsquo;s investment in the closed-end fund. It does not matter that neither Bob&rsquo;s past contribution nor his present solicitation had any nexus to the ongoing fees received by Obra Capital.</p>
<p>Also notable is the focus on mere solicitation of investments, which indicates that an actual investment decision is not required. Unsuccessful solicitation is enough to trigger a violation of the rule when paired with ongoing receipt of fees on longstanding investments. It does not matter that the investment decision pre-dated the contribution; receiving fees counts as &ldquo;provid[ing] investment advisory services for compensation,&rdquo; even though the relevant investment decision was made years earlier.</p>
<p>Advisers Act Section 206(4) provides the Commission broad authority to &ldquo;define, and prescribe means reasonably designed&rdquo; to prevent acts, practices, or courses of business that are fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Yet, as the Second Circuit noted years ago when construing a similar provision in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, &ldquo;the SEC&rsquo;s rulemaking power under this broad grant of authority is not unlimited. The rule must still be reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s pay-to-play rule begins with the dubious assertion that it is &ldquo;a means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts, practices, or courses of business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;This assertion is in tension with the fact that, as interpreted and applied, the pay-to-play rule &ldquo;does not require a showing of a&nbsp;<i>quid pro quo</i>&nbsp;or actual intent to influence and elected official or candidate.&rdquo; The facts in this proceeding illustrate the tension. There is no rational connection between a contribution to a Michigan official and solicitation of government entities in other states. Similarly, there is no rational connection between the ongoing fees received in consequence of an investment decision made by a government entity potentially influenced by a government official in prior years and a contribution made to a different, second government official years later, especially when neither the subsequent government official nor her appointees can undo the previous decision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>When we adopt and enforce rules that effectively chill a person&rsquo;s right to engage in political activity,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-obra-capital-management-081924#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;we must be scrupulous in our articulation of a close nexus between the disfavored conduct and the fraudulent conduct prevented. Because today&rsquo;s application of the pay-to-play rule&rsquo;s sweeping prohibition captures conduct that lacks any reasonable probability of unduly influencing actual investment decisions&mdash;the fraudulent conduct we seek to prevent&mdash;I must dissent.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Self-Reporting And Cooperation Credit In Enforcement Actions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Commission, self-reporting, enforcement, violations, CFTC <br />
Summary:<br /> 
- Commissioner disagrees with CFTC's failure to credit self-reporting<br /> 
- Concerns raised about cooperation credit standards and enforcement approach<br /> 
- Proposed improvements to internal governance and procedures<br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>While I support the Commission&rsquo;s administrative settlement with Raizen Energia SA and Raizen Trading SA (collectively, Raizen, a sugar commercial end-user), I do not agree with the decision to not provide recognition and cooperation credit for Raizen&rsquo;s self-reporting of the violations. It is my view that Raizen promptly self-reported the violations to the Division of Enforcement (DOE) once it had completed an internal investigation to determine the facts and circumstances and if any violations had occurred that would require self-reporting. Further, Raizen completed extensive remediation efforts and enhanced its compliance program prior to settlement.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This case is an example of why I have repeatedly raised concerns regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s contradictory approach to self-reporting by market participants of potential violations and the standard applied for &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; self-reporting, and therefore, whether the CFTC will provide recognition and cooperation credit. The CFTC often reiterates that cooperation credit is an important incentive to encourage self-reporting. I have also encouraged self-reporting in previous statements.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;However, by creating an impossible-to-meet standard for receiving cooperation credit, or by being arbitrary in the application of any standard, the CFTC&rsquo;s policy on self-reporting looks a lot like bait-and-switch.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I have also previously raised concerns regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement approach to non-material operational or technical issues. It is absurd to take the position that in order to receive cooperation credit, every incident of non-compliance would need to be self-reported to DOE. Consider a common scenario for a swap dealer: that would mean that every error in just one data field out of hundreds, for each individual trade, would need to be self-reported to DOE as a violation of swap data reporting regulations. That is clearly an unrealistic and unworkable expectation. Yet that is exactly the position on self-reporting and cooperation credit that the CFTC takes in its administrative settlements for non-material operational or technical issues in the absence of any harm.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>And, I have also raised concerns over the CFTC&rsquo;s position that issues that are self-reported and disclosed in a swap dealer&rsquo;s annual compliance report as required under CFTC regulations</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;are disqualified from consideration for cooperation credit, even where the firm makes a standalone, prompt self-report of a material non-compliance issue to the CFTC. Since swap dealers and futures commission merchants (FCMs) are required to file annual compliance reports which must be certified by the chief compliance officer or chief executive officer</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>as accurate and complete in all material respects under penalty of law, that means that those registrants will&nbsp;<i>never</i>&nbsp;qualify for cooperation credit in the majority of the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement actions, which are increasingly for compliance violations like trade reporting, recordkeeping, or documentation&mdash;not fraud, abuse, or manipulation, the main intent for the enforcement authority granted to the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This resulting &ldquo;examination by enforcement&rdquo; is why I have continually advocated for the CFTC to instead create a Division of Examinations that is appropriately resourced and staffed with trained and well-qualified examiners to handle supervisory matters in partnership with the National Futures Association (NFA). Then, the CFTC would finally no longer be an outlier among both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>&ldquo;Prompt&rdquo; Self-Reporting of Issues</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In several recent matters, the CFTC&rsquo;s position has been that self-reporting six months after the initial discovery of a potential non-compliance issue&mdash;during which time an internal review is performed and completed by the market participant&mdash;does not constitute &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; self-reporting. But it is more appropriate to consider whether the self-report was made promptly after a firm makes a determination in good faith that a material non-compliance issue has occurred, not from when the potential issue was first discovered. There may not be enough information at the time of initial discovery to determine if a non-compliance issue is material. Further, the issue must be fully scoped and any information validated in order to make a legal determination of material non-compliance.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Even if the CFTC wanted to start the clock for self-reporting from the time of initial discovery of a potential material non-compliance issue, six months is a reasonable time to complete an internal review&mdash;particularly if the facts and circumstances are complex with respect to products, jurisdictions, legal entities, organizational structure, governance, size, activities, operations, and so on. In addition, it is reasonable for a market participant to wait until the internal review or investigation is completed and the findings are validated before making a self-report to DOE, due to the serious legal liability issues.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For example, self-reporting to authorities involves appropriate management review and governance processes, including by senior or executive management. Those governance processes&mdash;as they should&mdash;take time to ensure careful due diligence, accuracy, and completeness.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Updates to Self-Reported Issues</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Even more concerning, the CFTC has sought to bring fraud charges against market participants for allegedly making false statements to the CFTC when a market participant later discovers that the information provided in a self-report was not entirely accurate&mdash;even when it thought the information was accurate at the time of the disclosure to the CFTC.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Put another way, when market participants have new and better information and they voluntarily update DOE, the CFTC tries to charge them with fraud. That is going to discourage prompt self-reporting to the CFTC, because market participants will need to take additional time to make sure any information provided to DOE is as accurate and complete as possible to try to mitigate the risk of being charged with making fraudulent false statements to the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s approach to self-reporting and approach to charges of making false statements create an inherent conflict and a Catch-22 for market participants. The CFTC should rethink its policy in these areas because if the CFTC wants potential material non-compliance issues to be self-reported promptly after the time of initial discovery, market participants need to be assured that they will not be charged with making false statements to the CFTC when more and better information becomes available.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I believe the CFTC must provide clarity on the standard for &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; self-reporting, including a safe harbor from charges of making false statements if the self-reported information is later supplemented or corrected. Until the CFTC provides a clear standard and applies it in a uniform manner, the inherent conflict and untenable legal risk associated with self-reporting prior to the completion of a full internal review or investigation will not be resolved, and the CFTC will not be effective in achieving its public policy objectives to encourage self-reporting of issues.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Roles and Responsibilities for CFTC Divisions</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In addition, the CFTC has maintained the position that self-reporting to the Market Participants Division (MPD) does not qualify for consideration for cooperation credit&mdash;even though MPD is the operating division with responsibility for rulemaking, interpretation, and oversight of registration and compliance requirements for CFTC registrants. Further, under CFTC regulations, registrants such as swap dealers are required to disclose material non-compliance issues to MPD, and have extensive additional compliance reporting requirements. The standard for materiality under CFTC regulations for purposes of compliance disclosures and reporting is also different than the standard of materiality that DOE applies in its enforcement actions.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As I have previously emphasized, the CFTC is one agency. It is nonsensical that self-reporting to the primary division that supervises a registrant as required under CFTC regulations does not constitute self-reporting for purposes of cooperation credit because there was no double-reporting to DOE. I believe that the CFTC&rsquo;s current approach to self-reporting is siloed and duplicative, usurps the roles and responsibilities of the primary operating division, and undermines the function and application of longstanding CFTC regulations for proper governance and disclosure of non-compliance issues by registrants.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Proposed Improvements to CFTC Internal Governance and Procedures</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission cannot allow the tail to wag the dog. That is why I have proposed for the past two years that the CFTC enhance and document its internal procedures for coordination among the primary operating divisions&mdash;MPD, the Division of Market Oversight (DMO), and the Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)&mdash;and DOE in order to improve regulatory clarity and consistency in the interpretation and application of CFTC regulations, improve internal governance, and minimize the CFTC&rsquo;s internal conflicts of interest.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It has been my observation that most of the CFTC&rsquo;s improper changes in the interpretation of decades-old CFTC regulations in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act due to the lack of a rational basis, reasoned decision-making, and public notice-and-comment&mdash;namely, regulation by enforcement&mdash;is because of unclear roles and responsibilities among CFTC divisions.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Accordingly, to address the root cause of the CFTC&rsquo;s disjointed approach to our regulations, my proposed enhancements include requiring the appropriate primary operating division to approve enforcement recommendations and supporting memoranda to the Commission that involve the interpretation and application of CFTC registration and compliance requirements (but not allegations of fraud or manipulation).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Another one of my proposed enhancements is to implement procedures and criteria for enforcement referrals by a primary operating division. This would be published on the CFTC&rsquo;s website to provide fair notice and due process for CFTC registrants and CFTC registered entities like designated contract markets (DCMs) and swap execution facilities (SEFs). These are common-sense improvements that prior CFTC leadership has attempted to implement. It is now beyond obvious that these procedures are necessary to ensure the protection of basic rights that Americans expect from their government.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I also propose that CFTC registrants and registered entities should self-report material non-compliance issues to the primary operating division that is responsible for their ongoing monitoring and oversight&mdash;MPD, DMO, or DCR. Then, that primary division would apply consistent criteria to determine whether to make an enforcement referral to DOE. In the future, I propose that if the Commission establishes a Division of Examinations, that would be the appropriate division to receive self-reports of material non-compliance issues and make enforcement referrals in consultation with the primary operating division. This is the common approach taken by other regulators. The public has a right to know what the CFTC expects, and that the CFTC will stick to that and not constantly change the rules for the CFTC&rsquo;s convenience.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>These improvements to the CFTC&rsquo;s internal governance and procedures would be an important first step towards transparency, ensuring regulatory clarity and consistency, and upholding the rule of law. A GAO study, as I have previously suggested, would identify even more improvements to make the CFTC more effective in carrying out our mission.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081924?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We should encourage and recognize CFTC registrants that proactively take ownership of their mistakes and work to prevent future violations. Meeting the desire to cooperate with an illusory choice that risks alleged charges of making fraudulent false statements is no way to incentivize good behavior. This is made even worse by the CFTC&rsquo;s lack of clear guidance for how and when registrants should engage on a potential violation. The CFTC must develop a better approach to self-reporting and cooperation credit to encourage firms to come forward with issues and recognize firms that take accountability measures, so that the CFTC can more efficiently deploy our limited resources to target true bad actors and promote market integrity. I hope that the CFTC will finally take these concerns seriously and implement the improvements that I have outlined.</span></span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Brazilian, energy company, sugar merchant, wash sales, CFTC <br />
<br />
The CFTC fined Raizen Energia and Raizen Trading for illegal wash sales and noncompetitive transactions in sugar futures contracts. ICE Futures U.S. also issued a penalty to Raizen Energia. <br />
- CFTC fines Raizen Energia and Raizen Trading for illegal transactions <br />
- Engaged in 44 wash sales and noncompetitive transactions involving sugar futures contracts <br />
- Wash EFPs accounted for more than 50,000 sugar contracts worth $1 billion <br />
- Raizen Energia also fined by ICE Futures U.S. for violating rules and failing to supervise <br />
<br />Summary: <br />The CFTC fined Raizen Energia and Raizen Trading for illegal transactions, and ICE Futures U.S. separately fined Raizen Energia for rule violations. <div>
<p><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against respondents&nbsp;<span>Raizen Energia</span>&nbsp;<span>SA</span>, a Brazilian energy company and sugar merchant, and&nbsp;<span>Raizen Trading SA</span>, a Swiss sugar merchant, for engaging in wash sales and non-competitive transactions. The order requires the respondents jointly and severally to pay a $750,000 civil monetary penalty. The respondents admit the facts detailed in the order and are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN">The order finds from March 2022 to September 2022, the respondents engaged in 44 wash sales and noncompetitive transactions by executing exchange for physical transactions (EFPs) involving sugar futures contracts traded on ICE Futures U.S. An EFP is a transaction involving a simultaneous exchange of a futures position for a corresponding cash position, i.e., one party buys the physical commodity and simultaneously sells or gives up a long futures contract, and the other party sells the physical commodity and simultaneously buys or receives a long futures contract.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The order concludes the respondents&rsquo; EFPs were illegal wash sales and noncompetitive transactions because they were executed between accounts that were not independently controlled. According to the order, the respondents executed the wash EFPs in order to facilitate the intercompany transfer of physical sugar between Raizen entities and to offset futures positions the respondents took to hedge the price risk associated with their physical sugar contracts. In the aggregate, the respondents&rsquo; wash EFPs accounted for more than 50,000 sugar contracts worth more than $1 billion.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN">The order acknowledges the respondents&rsquo; representations concerning their remediation in connection with this matter.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Parallel Exchange Action</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In a parallel, separate action, on April 19, ICE Futures U.S. issued a Disciplinary Notice in which Raizen Energia agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty to settle charges alleging Raizen Energia violated ICE&rsquo;s rules by executing prohibited EFPs, executing wash sales, and failing to diligently supervise Raizen&rsquo;s ICE-related activities. The CFTC thanks ICE Futures U.S. for its assistance.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Brian Hunt, Danielle Karst, Kelly Beck, Erica Bodin, and Rick Glaser.</span></span></span></p>

<title>From Latency To A.I. Algo Driven Capital Markets - By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<div> ECNs, Regulation National Market System, A.I., trading venues, market volatility<br />
Summary:<br />Over 50 years, ECNs disrupted stock exchanges. A.I. replaced latency-driven markets. Collaborative outsourced execution, diversity, mass customization, and decentralized learning are key. <div>
<p>Over half a century has passed since Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) disrupted the traditional floor-based model of stock exchanges. Ushering in the era of electronic trading. Since Regulation National Market System (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/34-51808.pdf">Reg. NMS</a>) was adopted almost 20 years ago, the honorable goal of promoting venue-by-venue competition and fair price formation across securities markets turned into a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2014-spch060514mjw">latency arm race</a>. Pushes <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Bottom%20Race%20Market%20Data%20Reform.pdf">market data</a> and connectivity costs to rise exponentially.</p>
<p>In the quest to gain an edge over competitors, trading venues offer different rebates (e.g. enhanced market-making discount), introduce a speed bump (e.g. liquidity enhancing access delayed), proliferate order-types (e.g. midpoint-extend-life order), come up with new business models (e.g. market-on-close) and create other privileges (e.g. exclusive access to certain pegging orders). People jockeying around to make money by altering the queuing and wait times at the "checkout counters". This has widened the gap between the haves and have-nots in the past.</p>
<p>It is a fitting moment to reflect on the evolution of capital markets. Several trends are emerging that could push today's market structure from a focus on latency to one driven by algorithmic and artificial intelligence (A.I.) technologies:</p>
<h4><b>If you can&rsquo;t beat them, join them (outsourced execution): </b></h4>
<p>A decade ago, former US SEC Chair Mary Jo White famously said, <i>&ldquo;deemphasize speed as a key to trading success.&rdquo;</i> Whether it is regulatory inaction, or the current administration&rsquo;s proposing a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analogies-taboo-secs-market-reform-kelvin-to/">wrong prescription</a>, market participants today still find it hard to beat the high-frequency trading (HFT) firms. So long as the Consolidated Tape is NOT a reasonable compromise if not a close substitute of Exchanges&rsquo; proprietary feeds, everyone is and will continue be subservient to telecom infrastructure vendors. There is not enough alpha for the HFTs to justify the costs and benefits in doing just proprietary trading. Thus, HFTs get into the business of outsourced trading execution services. With stock exchanges <a href="https://www.bayes.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/366599/sale-price-information-cass-knowledge.pdf">optimally restricting access</a> to price information by exploiting the inelasticity in demand of proprietary products, in turn, many choose to collaborate with the Haves for outsourced execution rather than compete.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; aims to maximize/ segment order flow for negotiation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rebate-tiering-competitive-pricing-different-market-centers-kelvin-to-u6l2e/">tier rebates</a> and other incentives that pose potential conflicts of interest and BestEx issues. The latency arm race would only subside if <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/market-data-available-securely-synchronized-time-kelvin-to/">time-lock encryption</a> is adopted to protect time sensitive data from being decrypted prematurely. The voluntary collaboration among the outsourcers and HFTs at echo chambers further complicates the markets. Aside from using transaction cost analyzers, liquidity sourcing and other tools or &ldquo;bandages&rdquo; to fabricate the fragmented markets, market participants are increasingly leveraging advance technologies, such as A.I., algo wheels, quant models, etc. to navigate and stay afloat in the markets.</p>
<h4><b>Despise echo-chambers&rsquo; polarization and trends toward a more diverse group of participants</b></h4>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century marks the beginning of a cyber punk era. Elites (Corpo) advertise their selected truths popular among those who rely on corporate thinking rather than developing an ability to <a href="https://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/independent-thinking/">think independently</a>. In the opposite spectrum, the rebellious mobilize the online communities (street kids) to orchestrate significant market movements. This is exemplified by the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf">MEME stock phenomenon</a>, where the na&iuml;ve were feeling enlightened or motivated by their &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; to do a gag that would otherwise be prohibited if it occurred at a broker-dealer, then top market-makers were being lambasted to advance the rebellious&rsquo; controversial agenda.</p>
<p>There are the digital nomads, infusing &ldquo;trust&rdquo; (analogous to MBS credit enhancement) into <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/digital-asset-portals-akin-stock-exchanges-casinos-kelvin-to/">digital assets</a> while they are building related financial infrastructures to rent seek on transactions flowing across. Foreign adversaries would like to see the US engaged in &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; competition to erode the US's prominent market position. Many do not seem to realize the emerging threats against capitalism or dare to admit it. DeFi and De-dollarization movements are on the rise and reap&nbsp;benefits out of chaos. Witnessing this dynamic, market participants would need their algo and A.I. to guide them in discerning who&rsquo;s who and doing what, that impacts the markets.</p>
<h4><b>One size does not fit all and mass customization</b></h4>
<p>Different trading venues (lit exchanges, dark pools, systemic internalizers, single dealer platforms) are like different <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trading-venue-perimeter-related-market-data-issue-kelvin-to/">streaming platforms</a> providing various contents (e.g. block trading, exotic, passive, conditional) that fit the appetite of respective subscribers. While we are generally supportive of standardization and harmonization of regimes, policy makers should also be warned that <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/07/27/open-access-interoperability-and-the-dtccs-unexpected-path-to-monopoly/">open access and interoperability</a> could inadvertently be a path to a monopoly or reinforcing the elites&rsquo; oligopoly that hurts fair competition.</p>
<p>SEC Commissioner Peirce reminds <i>&ldquo;Hardwiring a technology into a rule runs the risk of preserving that requirement far after that technology&rsquo;s expiration date&rdquo;</i> [amid Bloomberg is offering the open source FIGI reference data for FREE] with respect to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224">US joint data standards proposal in implementing the Financial Data Transparency Act</a>. Also, no matter how Data Expert Group(s) are working with regulatory authorities in calibrating the consolidated tapes, reference price arbitraged is inevitable when there is more than one de facto NBBOs under the US competing consolidators model (or EBBOs in the UK and EU). If the public markets opt to serve only the most liquid and static form of investments, the private markets will prevail for its flexibility to dynamically customize deals for the investing communities.</p>
<h4><b>From automated intelligence for economy of scale to decentralized federated learning</b></h4>
<p>Some said <i>&ldquo;A.I. stands for Automated Intelligence&rdquo;</i>. We agree that automation benefited the elites to achieve economy of scale in the past. However, federated learning and real-time analytic platforms (RTAP) are more efficient and effective to provide timely decisions and rapid responds in modern dynamic markets.</p>
<p>Today, many resources are devoted or wasted in sourcing alternate data. Too much data and inherent problems (timestamp synchronization) of data imprecision causing centralized intelligence to take forever to achieve &lsquo;golden source&rsquo;. Then, people are juggling to insert or remove nodes for tunning/ data corrections (e.g., Support Vector Machine requires labeled data), while not knowing valuable insights may inadvertently be removed from the dataset. In turn, inexactitude in trade sequencing caused analytic results based on vector measurement or visualized heat-maps to be erroneous (false +/-).</p>
<p>The trend is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Organization/Our%20Insights/For%20smarter%20decisions%20empower%20your%20employees/For-smarter-decisions-empower-your-employees.pdf">empowering</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/how-to-make-great-decisions-quickly">decision points</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/03/5-strategies-to-empower-employees-to-make-decisions">to the field</a>. Non-developers are now able to use no/low-code generation with A.I./ large language models to do some ad-hoc tasks for WYSIWYG rather than relying on the development team. Whereas the development team uses these tools to take on more complex projects, concentrate on quant modeling, reverse engineering of others&rsquo; algorithms, better Boolean logic, taxonomy, and whatnot.</p>
<h4><b>Market Volatility, A.I. Hallucinations and the surprising similarities between Music and Trading:</b></h4>
<p>Trading teams are poking holes in the initial results of A.I., which they are right to do so because there are different machine learning models. Firms should not go blindly with neural network, deep learning black boxes, then go about craving for evermore data to feed the models. While <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/34-100556.pdf">extraordinary</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volatility-pros-record-vix-surge-152005144.html">market</a> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/summers-calls-sec-exchanges-probe-164100423.html">volatility</a> and suspicions of A.I. hallucinations persist, there is also a growing recognition of the opportunities presented by newfound signals and liquidity amid chaos.</p>
<p>The performance of machine learning will improve over time. It may discover unknown and hidden opportunities which were previously nonsensical to humans. It is a paradigm shift to transition from a latency-driven capital market to one powered by algorithmic and A.I. machine learning technologies. Be open minded to explore the surprising similarities between <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Copyright%20Licensing.pdf">Music and Trading</a>. The sound that data makes is well suited to time series.</p>

<title>Race To The Bottom For Market Data Reform - By Kelvin To, Founder And President Of Data Boiler Technologies</title>

<div> Consolidated Tapes, Market Data Reforms, SEC Governance, FITRS, Liquidity, Financial Market, High-Frequency Trading, Ecosystem Degradation, FCA, Trade Reporting, Data Management

Summary:
Consolidated Tapes, Market Data Reforms, and SEC Governance are crucial for improving market transparency and liquidity. The current system faces challenges related to FITRS, high-frequency trading, and ecosystem degradation. The FCA's efforts at trade reporting and data management aim to address these challenges while ensuring market integrity. <div>
<p>The UK and EU are trying to catch up with the US in building their respective Consolidated Tapes (CT). The US has no intention to slow down and wait for the Europeans in market data reforms. Yet, the US <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/265FAD4E1FDE293F85258876004F2CF9/$file/21-1167-1953361.pdf">D.C. Circuit ruling in July 2022</a> weakens the already weak proposition of the SEC&rsquo;s governance requirements over the equity CT-Plan. The US decentralized competing model (DCM) of 2/3 Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) and 1/3 non-SROs representation in the operating committee cannot be executed. The SEC prescribed minimum terms and conditions (T&amp;C) for CT-Plan Version 2 in replacing the non-SRO representation provisions are ineffective (see <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20SEC%2020240226%20V2CTPlan.pdf">this</a>). The SEC has until <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nms/2024/34-100500.pdf">September 21, 2024</a>, to determine whether to approve or disapprove it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Improving the capabilities of the Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) that hosts the results of the MiFID transparency calculations in the UK and EU has stirred up much debate. Various stakeholders (<a href="https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Quarterly_Reports/ICMA-Quarterly-Report-Q3-2024.pdf">ICMA</a>, <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en/news-publications/publications/reports-research-and-analysis/bond-transparency-how-calibrate-publication-deferrals">AMF</a>, <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma70-154-165_smsc_opinion_transparency_third_countries.pdf">ESMA</a>, <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp23-32.pdf">FCA</a>) are conducting qualitative and quantitative assessments to decide the liquid classes of financial instruments, particularly for bonds. The industry is looking at the regulators to be the referee, while the regulators are asking the Data Expert Group (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/members/consult?memberId=131743&amp;memberTypeId=3&amp;lang=en&amp;fromExpertGroups=3938">DEG</a>) to propose recommendations. Liquidity is a highly subjective moot point. Learning from the US <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fixed-income-advisory-committee/transparency-panel-venkataraman-may-2020.pdf">FINRA&rsquo;s TRACE recalibration</a> to formulate a strategy to suit the issuers and the investors&rsquo; appetites would help. Though, regulators should not be finessing the calibration.</p>
<p>Given the stages of development and current market structure differences for equity and non-equity markets, the definition of &lsquo;real time&rsquo; for equity CT should NOT be the same for bonds. Doing so could be a detriment to the fixed income markets&rsquo; liquidity. The <a href="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SIFMA-Letter-to-SEC-on-Institution-of-Proceedings-on-1_Minute-Trade-Reporting-Final.pdf">US proposed rule</a> to reduce the 15-minute FINRA&rsquo;s TRACE reporting timeframe to 1-minute is problematic. We cannot comprehend why the ESMA in the&nbsp; EU maybe going cheap while <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-05/ESMA74-2134169708-7225_-_MiFIR_MiFID_Review_-_CP_on_CTPs_and_DRSPs.pdf">soliciting public comments</a> that stated, <i>&ldquo;in light of cost efficiency considerations, ESMA recognizes the potential benefits of establishing a single set of requirements applicable across the three asset classes. This approach would streamline compliance efforts for data contributors reporting to multiple CTPs across various asset classes, promoting operational efficiency and reducing administrative burdens.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176597002930">empirical study</a>, minimum requirements for the technical criteria are barriers to innovation. Potential bidders to become CT Providers (CTPs) in the UK and EU, or Competing Consolidators (CCs) in the US, would prioritize compliance over creativity. Its focus is on meeting regulatory requirements rather than exploring better ways to address problems (e.g. <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2015/11/2015-esma-1464_annex_i_-_draft_rts_and_its_on_mifid_ii_and_mifir.pdf">RTS-13 Article 10</a> incomplete or potentially erroneous information a.k.a. data quality issues + security and synchronization challenge amid aggregation distance/ location differential issues). <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/">Amazon Time Sync Service</a> provides time synchronization over Network Time Protocols. It has an observed accuracy of around 400 microseconds. Yet, multicast is not readily available in the public cloud. It has security and other complex issues. Why not learn from the current practices of High Frequency Trading firms/ self-aggregators when pursuing sub-microsecond precision?</p>
<p>Ecosystem degradation happens when damage is inflicted on others. Such damage can be in form of delayed access to information by subscribers of the public SIPs / CTPs, while trading venues&rsquo; (TVs) proprietary products (PPs) are unreasonably priced that <a href="https://www.cass.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/366599/sale-price-information-cass-knowledge.pdf">optimally allow access</a> to only by few elite players. It can also take the form of under developing the public SIP / CT feeds in favor of self-interest to promote PPs. Ecosystem degradation can also result in high barriers of entry, in which one must rely on certain tools (e.g., smart order routers, transaction cost analyzers, liquidity sourcing, outsourced execution services) to have a reasonable chance to survive in the market.</p>
<p>The UK is a few months ahead of the EU in consultation on improving <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20FCA%2020240306%20CP2332.pdf">markets&rsquo; transparency</a>. The FCA is <i>&ldquo;prioritizing the benefits of immediacy of price publication over full disclosure of traded volume.&rdquo;</i> Fragmentation is inevitable under Brexit. Although the FCA&rsquo;s efforts in collaborating with the industry to hash out many details for what they want in the CTs is&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">applaudable. We strongly disagree with LSEG&rsquo;s attempt to deter regulatory consideration of a market-wide request for a pre-trade equities CT (see </span><a href="https://www.thetradenews.com/blog/agree-to-disagree-on-lsegs-view-on-uk-consolidated-tape-for-equities/" style="font-size: 11px;">this</a><span style="font-size: 11px;">).</span></p>
<p>Putting it in layperson terms, the <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/uk-consolidated-tape-equities-view-london-stock-exchange">LSEG</a> and <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/NYSE_Price_Improvement_202208.pdf">NYSE</a> <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/Tick_Constrained_Stocks.pdf">studies</a> are about &lsquo;queuing and wait time at the checkout counters&rsquo;.&nbsp; We think slippage and other phenomena are related to the capabilities differences between lit Exchanges, Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), Systematic Internalizers (SIs), and Single Dealer Platforms (SDPs). The relative AVAILABILITY and price difference of mass market products (e.g., CT) versus TVs&rsquo; PPs and Approved Publication Arrangements&rsquo; (APAs) value-added services (VAS) is key. If the Have-Nots are willing to commit their limited resources to compete with the Haves, they should be given affordable and comparable choices.</p>
<p>Transmission and Availability are two different things. It is worth rethinking whether data should be required to be sent to the CTP and the whole concept of <i>&ldquo;Trade Reporting&rdquo;</i>. Instead of &ldquo;SEND&rdquo;, &ldquo;OBTAIN&rdquo; or read-only permission to &ldquo;wiretap&rdquo; data legally at its source is a better approach. Wiretapping is the fastest approach and would eliminate the intermediaries. In addition, it has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benefits of Consistency &ndash; the economy of scale for centralized data management, minimize data-in-motion for cybersecurity and privacy protection, data quality is no longer a problem because what being shared is fair to everyone, avoid conflicts/ arbitrations between multiple versions of truths.</li>
<li>Prevents a single point of failure &ndash; when one intermediary is down, X # of Investment Firms (IFs)&rsquo; data would be missing. While one IF&rsquo;s connection with CTP is down, the implication is far less. When the CTP is down, the experience will be consistent for everyone, rather than some having the information, and some do not.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Values of Bespoke Model connecting to everyone &ndash; enable the direct administration and enforcement of rights and obligations, mass customization through the powerful infrastructure, no melding nor favoritism by intermediaries to distort or subjectively allocate incentives.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <i>"same manner same method"</i> provision under the US SEC's Market Data Infrastructure Rule (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2020/34-90610.pdf">MDIR</a>) &ne;Collocation &ne; Latency Equalization &ne; Market Data Available SECURELY in SYNCHRONIZED TIME. The former SEC Chair <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2014-spch060514mjw">Mary Jo White</a> has stated the need to <i>&ldquo;deemphasize speed as a key to trading success.&rdquo;</i> Time-lock encryption protects time sensitive information from being decrypted prematurely. It eliminates the problem of where the CT data center is located.</p>
<p>Who owns the data and who gets what should NOT be dictated by regulators NOR by a small group of people in a &ldquo;governance committee&rdquo;. Rebate tiering and competitive pricing of different market centers are analogous to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rebate-tiering-competitive-pricing-different-market-centers-kelvin-to-u6l2e/">Private Clubs</a> favoring collaboration / outsourced trading. CT or other financial infrastructures are meant for the long-term. Policy makers should consider TVs as different streaming platforms and recognize the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/noumenon-equity-market-structure-kelvin-to/">noumenon</a> of rebate incentives serves as royalty payments for the use of others&rsquo; copyrighted material. Healthy development of the industry should NOT only focus on latency or the velocity factor, but also the 3 other aspects of the 4V's, namely: veracity, variety, and volume.</p>
<p>Regardless of the US, UK, or EU, dismissing related market structure issues and be short-sighted to do the bare minimum in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/up-and-running-consolidated-tape-versus-market-structure-kelvin-to-itlac/">checking the box</a>&rdquo; for market data reform is indeed a race towards the bottom. It will NOT achieve the goal of <i>&ldquo;affecting competitive pressures for existing sellers of market data, resulting in cheaper, higher quality and more accessible data for its users.&rdquo;</i> Market reform should be about the divergence between private and <a href="https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/THE%20MYTH%20OF%20SOCIAL%20COST.pdf">social costs</a> to delineate rights and obligations appropriately, as well as addressing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2024/34-100556.pdf">extraordinary</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volatility-pros-record-vix-surge-152005144.html">market</a> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/summers-calls-sec-exchanges-probe-164100423.html">volatility</a> (e.g., <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/03/business/nyse-trading-glitch-berkshire-hathaway.html">Berkshire</a>, <a href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html">Knight Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/one-year-after-nickel-fiasco-lme-left-with-multiple-headaches-2023-03-08/">LME</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-631/4631-39.pdf">Flash</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/24/a-short-history-of-stock-market-crashes.html">Crashes</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3868825-meme-stocks-blast-higher-as-short-squeeze-warning-bells-go-off">MEME stocks phenomenon</a>,&nbsp; and <a href="https://www.tradersmagazine.com/featured_articles/brokerage-outages-highlight-vulnerabilities-in-the-infrastructure-of-online-trading-platforms/">other vulnerabilities</a>), amid transition <a href="https://www.databoiler.com/index_htm_files/DataBoiler%20Latency2AI%20AlgoDriven.pdf">from latency to A.I. algo driven markets</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Financial Working Group, U.S. Department of the Treasury, People's Bank of China, AML, crisis management <br />
Summary:<br /> 
U.S. and China's financial working group met to discuss climate testing, AML, and financial stability. They also agreed to coordinate during financial stress. <div>
<p><span>The United States and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China held the fifth meeting of the Financial Working Group (FWG) in Shanghai on August 15-16.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Senior officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the People&rsquo;s Bank of China led the two-day meeting, with participation from other agencies. The meetings began with a review of outcomes from technical exchanges held bilaterally in June and July on central bank climate scenario testing, financial sector operational resilience, cross-border supply of financial services, and hypothetical Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) resolution. The Joint Treasury-People&rsquo;s Bank of China Cooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) met in-person for the second time since U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen announced its launch in April, and discussed beneficial ownership, updates on potential revisions of China&rsquo;s AML law, and other topics. Other meeting sessions included discussions on macroeconomic and financial stability, international financial institutions, cross-border payments and data, sustainable finance, and capital markets issues. U.S. officials also raised areas of disagreement during the conversations. The FWG meeting also included a roundtable of private Chinese and U.S. firms to exchange views on a range of topics related to climate financing, including transition planning and carbon markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The meetings concluded with Treasury and the PBOC exchanging letters in support of coordination during times of financial stress to strengthen appropriate information sharing and reduce overall uncertainty between Treasury and the PBOC regarding crisis management and recovery and resolution frameworks. The two sides also exchanged key points of contact to make it easier to quickly coordinate in instances of financial stress or operational resilience issues. The working group will continue to meet regularly and to hold additional follow up technical exercises.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The FWG is one of two working groups formed by Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He Lifeng of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China last September. The FWG is co-led by Brent Neiman, Assistant Secretary for International Finance at the U.S. Treasury, and Xuan Changneng, Deputy Governor of the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. The FWG reports directly to Secretary Yellen and Vice Premier He, and builds on President Biden&rsquo;s guidance following the Bali and Woodside Summits to deepen communications between the two countries.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> charges, Carl C. Icahn, IEP, margin loans, SEC <br />
Summary: <br />
SEC charges Icahn and IEP for failing to disclose Icahn's pledges of IEP securities as collateral for personal margin loans. They agreed to pay civil penalties. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Carl C. Icahn and his publicly traded company, Icahn Enterprises L.P. (IEP), for failing to disclose information relating to Icahn&rsquo;s pledges of IEP securities as collateral to secure personal margin loans worth billions of dollars under agreements with various lenders. IEP and Icahn agreed to pay $1.5 million and $500,000 in civil penalties, respectively, to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders, from at least December 31, 2018, through the present, Icahn, who is IEP&rsquo;s controlling shareholder and Chairman of the board of directors of IEP&rsquo;s general partner, pledged approximately 51 to 82 percent of IEP&rsquo;s outstanding securities as collateral to secure personal margin loans worth billions of dollars under agreements with various lenders. Notwithstanding Icahn&rsquo;s various margin loan agreements and amendments, IEP failed to disclose Icahn&rsquo;s pledges of IEP securities as required in its Form 10K until February 25, 2022. Icahn also failed to file amendments to Schedule 13D describing his personal margin loan agreements and amendments, which dated back to at least 2005, and failed to attach required guaranty agreements. Icahn&rsquo;s failure to file the required amendments to Schedule 13D persisted until at least July 9, 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal securities laws imposed independent disclosure obligations on both Icahn and IEP. These disclosures would have revealed that Icahn pledged over half of IEP&rsquo;s outstanding shares at any given time,&rdquo; said Osman Nawaz, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Complex Financial Instruments Unit (CFIU). &ldquo;Due to both disclosure failures, existing and prospective investors were deprived of required information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s orders find that IEP violated Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13a-1 thereunder and that Icahn violated certain beneficial ownership reporting provisions of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the findings, IEP and Icahn agreed to cease and desist from future violations and to pay the civil penalties referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Annie Hancock and Brian Fitzpatrick of the Asset Management Unit (AMU), Kelly Rock of the CFIU, Ling Yu of the New York Regional Office, and Kam Lee of SEC headquarters, with assistance from Nicholas Panos from the Office of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and Kevin Gershfeld and William Connolly from the Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. It was supervised by Joshua Brodsky and Mr. Nawaz of the CFIU and Corey Schuster of the AMU.&nbsp;</p>

I am delighted to welcome you all in person to the 2024 Summer Workshop on Money, Banking, Payments, and Finance, jointly organized by the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of Canada, and the Study Center Gerzensee.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240819a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I want to thank the organizers for putting together such an interesting program and also thank the participants for their contributions.</p>
<p>The evolving nature of money and banking creates new channels through which financial markets and institutions can affect the economy, with implications for all five of the Federal Reserve's functions, which are monetary policy, financial stability, supervision and regulation, payment systems, and consumers and communities. Relatedly, the emergence of new technologies can generate complex economic interactions, and theoretical research and analytical work are crucial to understanding the implications.</p>
<p>Many of the concepts underlying such economic interactions have for years been the study of this workshop. When I was research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I put together several iterations of this gathering. As the organization of the workshop has passed to a new generation, I continue to find it to be a leading venue for studying the economic mechanisms through which money, financial markets, contracts, and institutions affect economic activity and economic welfare. Past participants have advanced modern money and banking theory, bringing new insights to real-world economic problems and policy analysis. Numerous research papers presented in these workshops have been published in prestigious economics journals and influenced scholarship in this area.</p>
<p>If I had to describe the work that has been presented at this conference over the last 20-plus years, I would say it focuses on the economics of exchange and payment. Walrasian supply and demand models describe how an equilibrium quantity and price are determined but it is silent on two key questions: how do the goods get from seller to buyer and how is payment made from buyer to seller? In short, standard supply and demand analyses have nothing to say about the actual exchange process and how payment is made&mdash;in a sense, exchange and payment are viewed as trivial issues. By delving into the micro-foundations of exchange and payment, researchers in this area were able to identify key frictions that make exchange and payment far from trivial.</p>
<p>This is not just a theoretical issue that is only relevant to economists in ivory towers. Payments and the exchange process are multibillion-dollar businesses and private sector firms are constantly innovating in this area to overcome the types of frictions that are well-known to this group. The knowledge that I have gained from interacting with researchers in this area for the last 20 years has aided me in one of my roles as a Federal Reserve governor, supporting the Fed's oversight of the U.S. payment system. It also guides my thinking about how to make global payments cheaper and faster, which is a key objective adopted by the G20 countries in 2020 and is one fully supported by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Keeping with the tradition of studying exchange and payment, several papers to be presented this year focus on how frictions in financial markets, such as asymmetric information or asset illiquidity, matter for the transmission and implementation of monetary policy as well as unemployment and inflation. Similarly, it is great to continue seeing work studying frictional intermediation in asset markets and the implications for asset prices and the efficient sharing of risk. These contributions push the frontier of our knowledge, facilitate our understanding of real-world complexities, and inform policy thinking.</p>
<p>The workshop's focus on broader financial stability issues is also very important. Financial stability vulnerabilities, such as run risk, excessive leverage, and bubbly valuations, could amplify the effect of adverse shocks, potentially resulting in big economic losses and a slowdown in economic activity. Understanding the mechanisms that allow these vulnerabilities to grow and transmit stress to the rest of the financial system requires rigorous theoretical research and solid micro-foundations. Over the course of this week, we will hear interesting work on this topic that includes research questions such as how a central bank can balance interventions for financial stability and interventions to achieve a certain stance of monetary policy, how banks take risks, and understanding the risk of runs on banks, non-banks, and stablecoins.</p>
<p>Other concepts are newer and more novel. As the monetary and financial ecosystem has evolved, so has this workshop, bringing together many perspectives and modeling approaches to money and banking theory and its applications. One recurring theme has been to pay special attention to micro-foundations and institutional details, which is important to rigorously analyze and understand today's financial innovations and evaluate their implications for welfare and policy.</p>
<p>This year's workshop continues in that innovative spirit, keeping an eye on the future of money and banking. The papers to be presented span areas including decentralized ledgers, exchanges for crypto assets, and the impact of certain protocols on financial stability. Researching these new technologies helps us deepen our understanding of the implications for the broader financial system.</p>
<p>An important point to remember this week is that no single field of study can give the answers to all of the big questions we face relating to the evolution of money and banking. Commingling of insights and techniques from monetary theory, finance theory, and other fields is vital in studying the complex interactions of modern financial systems. Of course, it is also important to test our theories with available data, and many papers we will see this week deliver on that count as well.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let's get started. I hope you have a great week of engaging discussions, and I'm sure we will learn a lot from this year's workshop.</p>

<div> Affordable lending, Encompass update, Mortgage origination, Digital ecosystem, ICE Mortgage Technology
Summary:<br />ICE enhances Encompass digital mortgage platform to offer affordable lending solutions, increase operational efficiency, and streamline the mortgage lifecycle. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced several new enhancements to the Encompass&nbsp;<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;digital mortgage lending platform. As part of its mission of making the path to homeownership &ndash; and the experience from then on &ndash; as fast, accessible, and as simple as possible, ICE is making significant, ongoing investments to help lenders improve productivity, lower operational costs and provide more value to homebuyers.</p>
<p>With prospective homebuyers facing the most daunting affordability challenges in four decades, the most recent Encompass update features expanded capabilities for mortgage originators to offer beneficial affordable lending solutions for their customers. In addition, new features drive greater operational efficiency to help lower mortgage origination costs for lenders, and ultimately borrowers. Encompass now helps lenders quickly and easily determine a borrower&rsquo;s eligibility for a Department of Housing and Urban Development affordable loan program based on the borrower&rsquo;s FFIEC Median Income level for a given Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or Area Median Income (AMI).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affordability challenges are at the root of today&rsquo;s constricted housing and mortgage markets,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Everything we do is with an eye toward that economic reality. As we digitize the entire housing finance lifecycle, Encompass is continually updated to eliminate inefficiencies. The goal is to progressively reduce friction in the process &ndash; and with it, time and costs &ndash; via an integrated, end-to-end digital ecosystem. And by making the affordable loan eligibility identification process easier for lenders, we&rsquo;re also making it easier for them to match the right mortgage programs to the prospective homebuyers, expanding the potential options our clients can offer households in this market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the second major Encompass release of 2024. In April, following a sneak preview for clients and partners during the company&rsquo;s annual Experience conference in Las Vegas, ICE introduced powerful new capabilities that streamline document management and ensure data integrity throughout the mortgage lifecycle. Users also gained the ability to automate disclosures generation and simplify the underwriting process with the integration of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/data-document-automation" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Data &amp; Document Automation&nbsp;<sup>&trade;</sup>&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/mortgage-analyzers" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Analyzers&nbsp;<sup>&trade;</sup>&nbsp;</a>into the Encompass Underwriting Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Encompass remains an integral piece of our mission to overhaul U.S. housing finance technology for the benefit of American families,&rdquo; Bowler added. &ldquo;Incorporating both input, feedback and testing from our customers and industry partners, we&rsquo;re steadily delivering on our vision for an end-to-end digital ecosystem of solutions that improve the financial and operational performance of mortgage companies and, ultimately, deliver a better experience for homebuyers.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Target Zero Outages: The IOSCO Report And Resilience For Non-Stop Trading</title>

<div> Black Friday, IT outage, financial markets, IOSCO, CrowdStrike
Summary:
Financial markets face unprecedented IT outage, requiring clear communication, robust plans, and post-outage analysis. Exchanges struggle with technological upgrades and ecosystem compatibility. Internal IT teams will work in closer partnership. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The global cyber crash on Friday, July 19, has been declared the most significant IT outage in history, a claim supported by industry experts. This unprecedented disruption was likely the result of a perfect storm: an urgent update that bypassed extensive testing or an issue undetectable within the testing environment, leading to a problem that standard mitigations couldn't resolve. Whereas some faulty updates are rectifiable with subsequent updates or rollbacks, this escalated rapidly.</p>
<p>A CrowdStrike Black Friday-type event likely wasn't on the authors' minds of the recent IOSCO Report (FR04/2024) on market outages. Surveying IOSCO members, the report identifies 42 market outages from 2018 to 2022, primarily due to software and hardware issues. It emphasises the necessity for clear communication, robust outage plans, and effective business continuity measures to minimise the impact on market participants and the financial system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sinara.com/" title="Sinara">Sinara</a>, a London-based software house building and supporting systems for financial markets participants, fielded calls from concerned clients wanting to know if they were impacted by the July 19 event. &ldquo;We were fortunate to be unaffected and in a position to assist our customers if they needed support,&rdquo; says Steve Dobb (below), technical director at Sinara. &ldquo;Though it demonstrated the growing risks and the need to avoid similar disasters. We haven&rsquo;t seen anything at this scale hit the financial markets before, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are invulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img alt="Steve-Dobb.jpg" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Steve-Dobb_300.jpg" title="Steve-Dobb.jpg" /></p>
<p>IOSCO advised stock exchanges and trading platforms to develop and publicise plans for handling outages to offer greater predictability for customers. Although trading systems of exchanges remained unaffected on Friday, the broader financial markets ecosystem, including banks and tech groups, experienced significant disruptions, with some traders unable to access their systems to process trades.</p>
<p>The IOSCO report highlights that exchanges worldwide have suffered glitches and outages for various reasons, including software changes. However, none have matched the scale of the CrowdStrike event, with prior incidents being localised and lasting no more than a few hours.</p>
<p>An update to CrowdStrike's widely used "Falcon Sensor" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash, displaying the infamous "Blue Screen of Death." While software updates vary in urgency and all undergo some testing, they can still lead to unexpected issues. CrowdStrike swiftly identified the root cause and deployed a fix. Nevertheless, while a simple reboot restored functionality for some systems, others took longer to recover fully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes unforeseen issues can happen,&rdquo; continues Dobb, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s crucial that you have a process in place, and the right skills, to make sure you&rsquo;re able to manage them, work with your technology partners, and communicate what&rsquo;s going on with your customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A recent New York Stock Exchange glitch led to significant volatility in Berkshire Hathaway and Barrick Gold shares, and trading halts in dozens of other companies before the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>The IOSCO report underscores the necessity for trading venues to establish and publicise outage plans, execute effective communication strategies, and assess the implications for closing auctions and prices. It also emphasises the importance of post-outage analysis to improve future responses.</p>
<p>IOSCO outlines five best practices for trading venues to enhance market resilience: developing outage plans, enforcing communication strategies, reopening trading efficiently, managing closing auctions, and conducting post-outage reviews. These practices are designed to be flexible and adaptable across various market structures and regulatory environments.</p>
<p>Although these best practices are primarily designed for equity listing trading venues, IOSCO acknowledges their relevance to other trading venues, including non-listing and derivatives markets. IOSCO encourages adopting these practices while recognising that the final decision lies with individual venues and is subject to domestic legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The report also examines the legislative and regulatory frameworks within IOSCO jurisdictions, noting that most trading venues require business continuity plans and must notify regulators of outages. It highlights industry protocols, such as those from the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), to standardise communication and outage procedures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are all good practices,&rdquo; Dobb confirms, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s vital that they don&rsquo;t just exist on paper but are really put into practice, with regular test runs and training refreshers for staff. It&rsquo;s important people know what to do when problems happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, the IOSCO report provides a comprehensive analysis of market outages and offers practical recommendations to strengthen the resilience of financial markets. It advocates for a balanced approach that respects the unique circumstances of each market while promoting best practices for managing and recovering from trading disruptions.</p>
<p>Established, legacy players reliant on complex, ageing infrastructure dominate the global exchange landscape. Unsurprisingly, they struggle to keep pace with the increasingly demanding trading environment, whether due to higher volumes or evolving requirements. The ongoing cost pressures and scale of necessary technological overhauls make it challenging for exchanges to implement upgrades; shutting down an exchange for weeks to facilitate a complete transfer is not feasible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many ways that exchanges can introduce new and better technology, and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be all at once,&rdquo; says Dobb. &ldquo;The same goes for exchange members, who also need to make sure they have multiple ways of accessing their exchanges, in case one method fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another significant barrier to change is the broader ecosystem in which trading systems operate, consisting of various organisations dependent on infrastructure compatible only with legacy technology. Consequently, counterparties may be unwilling or unable to accommodate a switch or significant upgrade by the exchange.</p>
<p>One outcome of CrowdStrike's Black Friday will be internal IT teams working in closer partnership with their software suppliers, whether for security or other operations, to better manage the software update process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite right that our customers want to make sure they don&rsquo;t end up in the situation where an update that is supposed to make things better actually creates a problem,&rdquo; concludes Dobb. &ldquo;Certainly we at Sinara understand that even a small release needs to be treated with due care&mdash;otherwise we can all see the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<li>Not disclosing a correct version of its annual financial report for 2022 in time.</li>
<li>Not disclosing insider information about an acquisition as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Failing to explain to what extent the acquisition had been consolidated in its quarterly financial report, resulting in the report not allowing for a complete and correct assessment.</li>
<li>Including incorrect identity of a counterpart in a disclosure about an order and failing to disclose a correction as required.</li>
<li>Not disclosing a change of Certified Adviser as required by the Rulebook.</li>
<li>Failing to disclose a market assessment in a way that allowed for a complete and correct assessment.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee finds that the Company repeatedly and over a prolonged period has breached article 17 of MAR and the Rulebook. The Disciplinary Committee finds the breaches to be serious so that a fine shall be imposed. Considering the repeated breaches, and that they appear to be the result of a lack in capacity for providing the market with information, the Disciplinary Committee has decided to impose a fine of twelve annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<br />
Iress announces strong half-year results for 2024, with UK business leading the turnaround. Divestment of non-core businesses and accelerated investment in core competencies. Adjusted EBITDA growth and margin improvement.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Iress today announced its half year results for 2024, with its UK business contributing to a strong performance.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Price</span></strong><span>, said today in&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.iress.com%2Fmedia%2Fdocuments%2FASX_Announcement_-_Iress_reports_1H24_financial_results_FINAL.docx.pdf/1/010201916972f61b-cf99ba99-c05d-478b-8190-31465a43ce0a-000000/umuuBRNp17Mgh2GZ5Aia_sY0-Vg=387" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>an announcement</span></a><span>&nbsp;to the Australian Securities Exchange: &ldquo;We are executing well on our transformation initiatives and are on track to complete the program in the second half, with benefits being realised well ahead of schedule. Strong action on cost reduction has delivered operating leverage with our Adjusted EBITDA margin up 760 basis points to 21.7% and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 52%. Along with disciplined capital management we are driving increased returns and have upgraded our Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $A135-$141m for FY24, adjusted to $A126m-$132m post asset sales.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Through the sale of non-strategic assets, we have considerably strengthened our balance sheet which sits at 1.2x leverage following the completion of the sale of our UK Mortgages business early in the second half. Pleasingly, we now expect to be in a position to reinstate a final dividend for FY24.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Iress&rsquo; UK business reported a significant turnaround in financial performance under renewed leadership.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Key financial highlights include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Headline revenue growth of 2%</span><span>&nbsp;when compared the prior corresponding period (&ldquo;PCP&rdquo;</span><span>)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Recurring and total revenue growth of 4% and 5% respectively on a continuing businesses basis (ie excluding the divested UK Mortgages and Pulse businesses) when compared the PCP</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Adjusted EBITDA growth of 34% compared the PCP</span><span><sup>3</sup></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other business highlights included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The divestment of non-core businesses in UK Mortgages and Pulse, streamlining the business and enabling Iress to focus on core competencies of Sourcing &amp; Wealth in the UK.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Significant improvement in earnings, driven by cost efficiency measures and revenue growth in underlying businesses.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Re-signing of three significant clients in UK Wealth locking in approximately &pound;43m in revenue over the next five years.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Powering acquisitive Listed and Private Equity backed advice firms, supporting the consolidation of their acquisitions onto Xplan, through Iress&rsquo; data migration expertise.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Accelerated investment in Iress&rsquo; Sourcing technology and products to further enhance its market-leading position and offerings to clients.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Executive Managing Director - UK, Alistair Morgan,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;I am really pleased with the results we&rsquo;ve delivered in the first half of the year and particularly proud of the performance of the UK business unit. We have now streamlined our business through the targeted Mortgages and Pulse divestments to concentrate on our core Wealth and Sourcing businesses, and are continuing to invest in our product and service delivery to clients. We are already seeing the benefit of this with improved revenue and margin, a testament to the dedication and client-focus of our people.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The renewal of three enterprise Wealth clients with a combined contract value of &pound;43m over the next five years and the consolidation of our clients&rsquo; acquisitions onto Xplan demonstrates that the model of empowering the UK business to autonomously operate its product, technology and commercial operations is resonating with clients. Combined with new wins in Wealth and Sourcing, this demonstrates the strength of our value and commitment to clients in a key market for Iress that is poised for future growth.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The increased third-quarter 2024 dividend, representing a 15 percent increase from the prior quarter's dividend of $0.55 per share, is payable on September 13, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 30, 2024.</p>

The repurchase program permits the company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation.

<title>Bank Of England: Change In Collateral Eligibility Criteria For Regulated Covered Bonds In The Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework - Market Notice 16 August 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-change-in-collateral-eligibility-criteria-for-regulated-covered/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-change-in-collateral-eligibility-criteria-for-regulated-covered/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> September, Level B collateral, Sterling Monetary Framework, Regulated Covered Bond, eligibility criteria <br />
Summary: From September, the minimum issue size for UK, French, and German Regulated Covered Bonds as Level B collateral is lowered. Eligibility criteria remain unchanged. Covered bonds must meet transparency requirements. Revisions may reclassify existing collateral. Eligibility requests must be submitted for review. <br /> <div>
<p><span>From 1 September, to be eligible as Level B collateral in the Bank&rsquo;s Sterling Monetary Framework, the minimum original issue size of a UK, French or German Regulated Covered Bond will be lowered to &pound;500 million or &euro;500 million, from &pound;1 billion or &euro;1 billion.</span></p>
<h2>Market notice</h2>
<p>From 1 September, to be eligible as Level B collateral in the Bank&rsquo;s Sterling Monetary Framework, the minimum original issue size of a UK, French or German Regulated Covered Bond will be lowered to &pound;500 million or &euro;500 million, from &pound;1 billion or &euro;1 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond this change to the issue size criterion, the other eligibility criteria for RCBs to be Level B collateral are unchanged: the RCB must be a UK, French or German RCB and of the highest credit quality (broadly equivalent to AAA); and the underlying assets must be homogenous pools of UK or EEA social housing loans, public sector debt, or prime residential mortgage loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change reflects developments in benchmark issue sizes for regulated covered bonds and takes account of prudential liquidity requirements.</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;issue size&rsquo; means the nominal amount issued, measured at the time of issue, for all RCBs of the same International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) as the RCB for which eligibility is sought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Covered bonds that do not meet the Level B eligibility criteria, including UK, French or German RCBs with an original issue size of less than &pound;500million or &euro;500million, can continue to be considered for eligibility as Level C collateral. Own-name issued RCBs can continue to be considered for eligibility as Level C collateral.</p>
<p>Covered bonds must also meet the Bank's transparency requirements (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2019/detailed-transparency-requirements-for-abs-and-covered-bonds-october-2019">Detailed transparency requirements for asset backed securities and covered bonds - Market Notice 11 October 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Following this change, RCBs that are already eligible as collateral will be reclassified between Level B and C accordingly and the Bank will contact affected participants separately.</p>
<h3>Eligibility requests</h3>
<p>When requesting eligibility for an RCB (or any other ABS), SMF participants must continue to complete the Bank&rsquo;s ABS-CERT template and request eligibility by submitting it to the Bank&rsquo;s Eligible Collateral team for review. (For more details, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/eligible-collateral">Eligible collateral page</a>)</p>

<title>Uganda Securities Exchange Joins Phase 2 Of The African Exchanges Linkage Project</title>

<div> Uganda Securities Exchange, African Exchanges Linkage Project, ASEA, cross-border trading, investment <br />
Summary:<br />Uganda Securities Exchange joins AELP to enhance cross-border trading, market integration, and investor opportunities, strengthening African capital market. <div>
<p>The African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA) is pleased to announce that the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) has officially joined Phase 2 of the African Exchanges Linkage Project (AELP). With this inclusion, the AELP now comprises ten participating exchanges representing 17 countries, enhancing the potential for cross-border trading, collaboration, and capacity building across the continent.</p>
<p>The AELP, which went live in November 2022, is an initiative of ASEA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) aimed at connecting Africa&rsquo;s leading securities exchanges to facilitate seamless cross-border trading and investment. This integration allows for greater market liquidity, improved access to capital, and enhanced investor opportunities across Africa&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
<p>The Uganda Securities Exchange, established in June 1997, has a proven track record of growth and innovation in Uganda's financial market. As the principal stock exchange in Uganda, licensed by the Capital Markets Authority of Uganda, the USE has successfully navigated key milestones, including the automation of its Securities Central Depository (SCD) in 2010 and its demutualization in 2018. These advancements have significantly improved its governance and operational efficiency, making it a leader in Uganda's financial sector.</p>
<p>By joining Phase 2 of the African Exchanges Linkage Project (AELP), the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) strengthens its commitment to regional market integration, building on its participation in the East African Community&rsquo;s Capital Markets Integration (CMI) project. The president of ASEA and CEO of Rwanda Stock Exchange, Mr. Pierre Celestin Rwabukumba said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see countries and coming together to strengthen economic ties and promote growth in the region.&nbsp; Uganda coming on board with other ASEA member exchanges will enhance collaboration and economic growth within participating exchanges thus enhancing further the wider Africa Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA) efforts.&rdquo; This inclusion allows Ugandan investors access to a wider range of investment opportunities across the continent while attracting international investors to Uganda's growing market. The USE will play a crucial role in enhancing liquidity, boosting trade volumes, and fostering closer ties between African exchanges, contributing to the creation of a more integrated, resilient, and competitive African capital market.</p>
<p>The AELP&rsquo;s expansion into ten exchanges and potentially over 40 stockbrokers, including USE&rsquo;s notable brokers such as Crested Stocks and Securities Limited and SBG Securities Uganda Limited, is a testament to ASEA&rsquo;s dedication to fostering collaboration and growth within Africa&rsquo;s capital markets. This expansion has been made possible through the support of the African Development Bank (AfDB), which recently awarded ASEA a second grant to facilitate the inclusion of additional participants in the project.</p>

<div> fine, PwC, audit, LCF, fraud <br />
The FCA fined PwC for not reporting suspicions of fraud in their audit of LCF, which later went into administration. <br /><br />Summary: The FCA fined PwC for failing to report suspicions of fraud in their audit of LCF, which went into administration. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) for failing to report to the regulator their belief that London Capital &amp; Finance plc (LCF) might be involved in fraudulent activity. This is the first time the FCA has fined an audit firm.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>PwC encountered significant issues throughout their 2016 audit of LCF. A senior individual at LCF acted aggressively towards auditors, and the firm provided PwC with inaccurate and misleading information. PwC found the audit very complex, and it took considerably longer to complete than anticipated. LCF&rsquo;s actions, and PwC&rsquo;s own work on the audit, led PwC to suspect that LCF might be involved in fraudulent activity. PwC was duty bound to report those suspicions to the FCA as soon as possible, but they failed to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>PwC eventually satisfied itself that LCF's 2016 accounts were accurate. Whether or not its suspicions remained, it still had an obligation to report its previous concerns to the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>LCF went into administration in January 2019 after the FCA ordered the firm to withdraw misleading promotional material for the sale of mini-bonds. Thousands of investors were misled because they were not given the full picture about the risks of the product.&nbsp;The Serious Fraud Office has an open criminal investigation into the failure of LCF.</span></p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'Auditors have a central role to play in keeping our markets clean. They have privileged access to information and they are required by law to report suspicions of fraud to the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>'There were a number of red flags that led PwC to suspect fraud. They should have acted on them immediately. Their failure to do so deprived the FCA of potentially vital information.'</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>

<li>Given the interest in this case, the FCA can confirm that this notice is the final outcome in connection to failures relating to LCF.</li>
<li>This investigation was run in parallel with the recent investigations carried out by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). The&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.frc.org.uk/news-and-events/news/2024/05/sanctions-against-three-audit-firms-over-the-audits-of-london-capital-finance-plc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FRC published its findings<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;on 7 May 2024.</li>
<li>The FCA has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-censures-london-capital-finance-plc" title="FCA censures London Capital &amp; Finance plc">censured LCF</a>&nbsp;for its unfair and misleading financial promotions of mini-bonds.</li>

<li>The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has paid out &pound;57.6 million to eligible bondholders who lost money when LCF collapsed. The Government has also paid &pound;115 million to eligible bondholders through a 'one-off'&nbsp;scheme which is now closed. The work of LCF&rsquo;s administrators to recover creditors' funds remains ongoing.</li>

<div> unveiled, GROWMatch, agri-business, financing, sustainable <br />
Summary:<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia launched GROWMatch, a funding initiative for agri-businesses, tapping into ECF and P2P platforms, and partnering with various organizations to promote food security self-sufficiency. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today unveiled GROWMatch, a new matching initiative that allows agri-business entrepreneurs to showcase their projects and attract necessary funding.</p>
<p>This initiative aims to address the financing gap faced by agri-businesses and promote sustainable growth in the sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Minister of Digital, YB Tuan Gobind Singh Deo delivered the keynote address at the event. Alternative financing options in the capital market can help spur the country&rsquo;s economic growth and address food security challenges.</p>
<p>GROWMatch taps into equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to-peer financing (P2P) platforms to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in strategic and underserved sectors.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Since their inception, both ECF and P2P platforms have helped over 18,000 MSMEs raise nearly RM8 billion in funding as of June 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GROWMatch, which is aligned with the SC&rsquo;s Five-Year Roadmap (2024-2028) for MSMEs and mid-tier companies, is focusing on providing risk capital through private markets.&nbsp;</p>

<div> June 2024 TIC Data, Treasury International Capital, Financial Flows, U.S. Department of the Treasury<br />
Summary: In June 2024, net TIC inflow was $107.5 billion, with $131.6 billion in net foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills increased by $6.2 billion. Banks' own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $50.3 billion. U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $35.4 billion. After including adjustments, the overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $96.1 billion in June. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for June 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for July 2024, is scheduled for September 18, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in June of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $107.5 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $81.4 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $26.1 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in June; their net purchases were $131.6 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $120.1 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $11.4 billion.</p>

<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $96.1 billion in June.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $6.2 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $38.9 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by $50.3 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>

<h3>About TIC Data</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<div> Keywords: FCA, censure, Macintyre Hudson LLP, client assets, audit breaches <br />
Summary: The FCA censured auditor Macintyre Hudson LLP for failing to prepare client assets reports and notify rule breaches, impacting consumer protection. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has censured the auditor Macintyre Hudson LLP (MHA) for failing to prepare client assets reports to the required standard.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>MHA failed to notify the FCA of rule breaches by firms it had audited, which could have put customers&rsquo; money at risk.</p>
<p>Client asset protection is a key part of maintaining market confidence, financial stability and consumer protection. Firms that hold client assets are required to have an auditor provide a client assets report to the FCA on an annual basis except in limited circumstances. The FCA relies on the accuracy of these client assets reports to monitor whether firms are complying with its rules, so it is important that auditors ensure their reporting is accurate.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s investigation found that between 2015 and 2019, MHA failed to prepare 4 client assets reports (relating to 2 firms) to the required standard. It failed to report 25 breaches of the rules by firms it had audited. These ranged from failings in documentation, to firm&rsquo;s assets being held alongside client assets.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'In a first of its kind, this censure underscores the important role that auditors play in providing accurate reports on whether firms are complying with our rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'This information helps us to safeguard customer funds and reduce the harm caused by firm failures. We expect all firms to ensure that they&rsquo;re providing full and accurate reports.'</p>

<li><a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/CASS/" target="_blank" title="CASS Client Assets | FCA Handbook">CASS rules</a>&nbsp;are particularly important when firms fail or exit the market.

<title>CFTC Orders Truist Bank To Pay $3 Million Penalty And Remediate Recordkeeping And Supervision Failures Relating To Widespread Use Of Unapproved Communications Methods - Truist Receives Substantially Reduced Penalty For Self-Reporting To The Division Of Enforcement</title>

<div> self-report, cooperation, recordkeeping, supervision, penalty
Summary:
Truist Bank settled charges with CFTC for recordkeeping and supervision violations, self-reported, cooperated, and paid a reduced penalty. SEC also imposed penalties.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against North Carolina swap dealer&nbsp;Truist Bank. The order finds Truist failed to maintain, preserve, or produce records required to be kept under CFTC recordkeeping requirements. Truist also failed to diligently supervise matters related to its business as a CFTC swap dealer.</p>
<p>Truist admits the facts detailed in the order, is ordered to cease and desist from further violations of recordkeeping and supervision requirements, is ordered to pay a $3 million civil monetary penalty, and is ordered to engage in specific remedial undertakings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truist self-reported it proactively conducted a review of the use of unapproved communications methods by its employees. The review demonstrated widespread and longstanding use of unapproved communication methods by swap dealer employees&mdash;including senior-level employees&mdash;to engage in firm business. The order recognizes Truist&rsquo;s self-report, its substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation, and remediation in the form of a substantially reduced penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In responding to an industry-wide and consequential problem, Truist set itself apart from the more than 20 other registrants the CFTC brought actions against for use of unapproved communications methods. How? Truist made the decision to self-report to the Division of Enforcement it had serious recordkeeping and supervisory failures. It is the only registrant to do so,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Truist&rsquo;s decision to self-report, cooperate, remediate, and be held accountable allowed it to benefit in the form of a substantially reduced penalty. At the same time, the CFTC&rsquo;s message remains clear&mdash;recordkeeping and supervision requirements are fundamental, and registrants that fail to comply with these core obligations do so at their own peril.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background&nbsp;</p>
<p>From December 2019 through the present, Truist&rsquo;s policies and procedures broadly prohibited employees from using unapproved communication methods, such as personal text messages and social applications, to engage in business-related communications about the firm&rsquo;s swap dealer. Truist required regular attestations from swap dealer employees that they were not using personal text messages and social applications to engage in business-related communications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Messages sent through Truist-approved communications methods were monitored, subject to review, and when appropriate, archived. By contrast, messages sent using unapproved communication methods, including personal text messages, were generally not monitored, subject to review, or archived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of Truist&rsquo;s failure to ensure that employees&mdash;including supervisors and senior-level employees&mdash;complied with the firm&rsquo;s communications policies and procedures, Truist failed to maintain many business-related communications, including communications in connection with its commodities and swaps business, and thus failed to diligently supervise its business as a CFTC registrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reviewing public CFTC orders entered with other CFTC registrants for similar conduct, Truist undertook its own internal survey of senior employees, identified potential violations, and promptly self-reported those facts to the CFTC. Truist substantially cooperated with the CFTC&rsquo;s investigation, including expanding and sharing the results of its sampling analysis. Truist represents it is enhancing its disciplinary policies and continuing remediation efforts it began at the time of the self-report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related Civil Actions&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today also filed and settled an order against Truist Securities, Inc., Truist Investment Services, Inc., and Truist Advisory Services, Inc., and imposed a civil monetary penalty for recordkeeping and supervision violations related to the use of unapproved communications methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Ansley Schrimpf, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth Streit, Scott Williamson, and Robert T. Howell.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders TD Bank To Pay $4 Million For Supervision Failures Impacting Its Electronic Communications Surveillance System</title>

<div> order, TD Bank, communications surveillance system, civil monetary penalty, supervision requirements
Summary:<br />TD Bank failed to supervise electronic communications over a five-year period, resulting in a $4 million penalty for CFTC violations. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;The Toronto Dominion Bank&nbsp;(TD Bank), a registered swap dealer, for failing to diligently supervise activities related to its business as a CFTC registrant, specifically, its electronic communications surveillance system. This resulted in TD Bank failing to surveil certain communications for hundreds of its swap dealer personnel over a five-year period.</p>
<p>The order requires TD Bank to pay a $4 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations of the CFTC&rsquo;s supervision requirements, and comply with conditions and undertakings specified in the order. TD Bank admits the facts in the order and acknowledges its conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Communications surveillance is a critical component of an effective system of supervision,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;This order and the significant monetary penalty reflect that swap dealers must not only have robust systems to detect and prevent market abuse and other misconduct, they must also vigilantly oversee and monitor those systems to ensure they are working. The CFTC will take appropriate action where a registrant&rsquo;s surveillance systems lack effective oversight and monitoring resulting in supervisory failures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order finds TD Bank lacked effective oversight and internal monitoring over its electronic communications surveillance system, resulting in TD Bank&rsquo;s failure to surveil certain communications for hundreds of its swap dealer personnel over a five-year period.</p>
<p>According to the order, TD Bank allowed its personnel to use an electronic messaging platform and used an automated surveillance tool to surveil communications made over the messaging platform. In 2016, TD Bank had an automated process to ingest messaging platform communications into its surveillance tool, which involved, among other things, updating TD Bank&rsquo;s internal record of&nbsp;messaging platform accounts&nbsp;to include accounts that had been recently created. In July 2016, TD Bank&rsquo;s vendor made a change impacting that automated process, and subsequently, as a temporary measure, TD Bank began updating its internal record of messaging platform accounts on a manual basis. However, in January 2018, TD Bank stopped updating its internal record of accounts manually. As a result, messages from messaging platform accounts for TD Bank personnel created after January 2018 were generally not ingested into TD Bank&rsquo;s surveillance tool and were not surveilled. The order also finds that after switching to the manual process, TD Bank did not put in place any supervision or internal monitoring to ensure the manual process was conducted or detect if it was not.</p>
<p>The order further finds in October 2019, when TD Bank finally updated its automated process to address the July 2016 change by its vendor, TD Bank did not test all of its process for ingesting messages for new accounts into its surveillance tool to ensure it was functioning again as expected. Therefore, TD Bank did not detect there had been another technical change by its vendor that prevented TD Bank&rsquo;s automated process from functioning properly. Instead, TD Bank continued, until March 2023, to fail to surveil messages for all new messaging platform accounts created after January 2018. The order finds TD Bank lacked effective oversight over its electronic communications surveillance system, including that its monitoring to identify gaps in its surveillance was insufficient to alert it to its surveillance gap and that it did not escalate any of its surveillance technology issues to a more senior oversight body until after it discovered its years-long failure in June 2023.</p>
<p>In accepting TD Bank&rsquo;s offer, the CFTC recognized the cooperation of TD Bank with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s investigation. The CFTC also acknowledges TD Bank&rsquo;s representations concerning its remediation in connection with this matter.</p>
<p>The CFTC acknowledges the assistance of the Ontario Securities Commission.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Penina Moisa, Andrew Rodgers, Alejandra de Urioste, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan. Devin Cain and R. Stephen Painter, Jr. also assisted with this matter.</p>

<div> broker-dealers, investment advisers, dually-registered, SEC, recordkeeping<br />
Summary: The SEC charged 26 firms with widespread recordkeeping failures, imposing civil penalties and mandating compliance improvements. Multiple firms self-reported violations.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against 26 broker-dealers, investment advisers, and dually-registered broker-dealers and investment advisers for widespread and longstanding failures by the firms and their personnel to maintain and preserve electronic communications.</p>
<p>The firms admitted the facts set forth in their respective SEC orders, acknowledged that their conduct violated recordkeeping provisions of the federal securities laws, agreed to pay combined civil penalties of $392.75 million, as outlined below, and have begun implementing improvements to their compliance policies and procedures to address these violations. Three of the firms, as noted below, self-reported their violations and, as a result, will pay significantly lower civil penalties than they would have otherwise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., L.P. agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>LPL Financial LLC agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. agreed to pay a $50 million penalty</li>
<li>RBC Capital Markets, LLC agreed to pay a $45 million penalty</li>
<li>BNY Mellon Securities Corporation, together with Pershing LLC, agreed to pay a $40 million penalty</li>
<li>TD Securities (USA) LLC, together with TD Private Client Wealth LLC and Epoch Investment Partners, Inc., agreed to pay a $30 million penalty</li>
<li>Osaic Services, Inc., together with Osaic Wealth, Inc., agreed to pay an $18 million penalty</li>
<li>Cowen and Company, LLC, together with Cowen Investment Management LLC, agreed to pay a $16.5 million penalty</li>
<li>Piper Sandler &amp; Co. agreed to pay a $14 million penalty</li>
<li>First Trust Portfolios L.P. agreed to pay an $8 million penalty</li>
<li>Apex Clearing Corporation agreed to pay a $6 million penalty</li>
<li>Truist Securities, Inc., together with Truist Investment Services, Inc. and Truist&nbsp;Advisory Services, Inc., which self-reported, agreed to pay a $5.5 million penalty</li>
<li>Cetera Advisor Networks LLC, together with Cetera Investment Services LLC, which self-reported, agreed to pay a $4.5 million penalty</li>
<li>Great Point Capital, LLC agreed to pay a $2 million penalty</li>
<li>Hilltop Securities Inc., which self-reported, agreed to pay a $1.6 million penalty</li>
<li>P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP agreed to pay a $1.25 million penalty</li>
<li>Haitong International Securities (USA) Inc. agreed to pay a $400,000 penalty</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As today&rsquo;s enforcement actions against more than two dozen firms reflect, we remain committed to ensuring compliance with the books and records requirements of the federal securities laws, which are essential to investor protection and well-functioning markets,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Among this group of firms, there are several that differentiated themselves by self-reporting prior to the staff&rsquo;s investigation, demonstrating once again the real benefits of proactive cooperation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the SEC&rsquo;s investigations uncovered pervasive and longstanding use of unapproved communication methods, known as off-channel communications, at these firms. As described in the SEC&rsquo;s orders, the firms admitted that, during the relevant periods, their personnel sent and received off-channel communications that were records required to be maintained under the securities laws. The failure to maintain and preserve required records deprives the SEC of these communications in its investigations. The failures involved personnel at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior managers.</p>
<p>The firms were each charged with violating certain recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, the Investment Advisers Act, or both. The firms were also each charged with failing to reasonably supervise their personnel with a view to preventing and detecting those violations.</p>
<p>In addition to the significant financial penalties, each of the firms was ordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant recordkeeping provisions and was censured.</p>
<p>Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced settlements with The Toronto Dominion Bank, Cowen and Company, and Truist Bank for related conduct.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into Ameriprise Financial Services, Edward Jones, LPL, Raymond James, and RBC were conducted by Karen E. Willenken, Craig C. Welter, Wesley W. Wintermyer, Christopher M. Castano, and Alison T. Conn.&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into BNY and Pershing, the Cowen entities, Haitong, and the TD entities were conducted by Laurel S. Fensterstock, Austin Thompson, Karolina Klyuchnikova, and Alison R. Levine. The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into P. Schoenfeld was conducted by Howard Kim and Adam Grace. Each of these matters was supervised by Thomas P. Smith, Jr. of the New York Regional Office.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation into Apex Clearing was conducted by Oreste McClung, Brian Higgins, and Brendan McGlynn and was supervised by Scott Thompson and Nicholas Grippo of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into the Cetera entities, First Trust, Great Point, Hilltop, the Osaic entities, and Piper were conducted by Regina LaMonica, Ruta G. Dudenas, Som P. Dalal, Anne C. McKinley, and Amy S. Cotter and were supervised by Kathryn A. Pyszka and Paul A. Montoya of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s investigations into the Truist entities were conducted by Grant Swanson and Ian Rupell and were supervised by Laura Josephs.</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Off-Channel Communications Matter</title>

<div> registered APs, CFTC, recordkeeping, enforcement action, investigation
Summary:<br />Registered Associated Persons (APs) of IBs must comply with recordkeeping requirements, and the CFTC should conduct its own investigation.<br />The CFTC allegedly misused its power without evidence of a violation, leading to de-registration of IBs and less market participants.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>I respectfully dissent on&nbsp;<i>In re Cowen and Co.</i>&nbsp;because the administrative record does not include evidence that any CFTC registered Associated Persons (APs)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement081424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1">[1]</a>&nbsp;engaged in activity that was in violation of the CFTC&rsquo;s recordkeeping requirements for introducing brokers (IBs), such as maintaining records of transactions, orders, and other business &ldquo;relating to dealing in commodity interests,&rdquo; or communications &ldquo;concerning quotes, solicitations, bids, offers, instructions, trading, and prices that lead to the execution of a transaction in a commodity interest.&rdquo; These are specific types of records.&nbsp;Based on the information in the administrative record, however, the CFTC only reviewed the sample provided by Respondent to the SEC regarding Respondent&rsquo;s FINRA-registered representatives.&nbsp;<i>None of the persons in the SEC sample was a CFTC AP</i>. Consequently, there was no evidence in the administrative record involving CFTC APs and the specific types of records that IBs are required to maintain. I am unable to support an enforcement action that does not have any evidence that the alleged violations actually occurred. Therefore, I must dissent.</p>
<p>This case appears to be the CFTC&rsquo;s piggybacking off the SEC&rsquo;s investigation to misuse the power of the U.S. government to obtain a $3 million settlement from Respondent&mdash;all without any evidence of a CFTC violation. I believe the CFTC should have conducted its own investigation such as, at the very least, its own sample of Respondent&rsquo;s limited number of CFTC APs to determine whether there was, in fact, any violation of CFTC rules.</p>
<p>I note that of the three &ldquo;off-channel communications&rdquo; cases brought against IBs, two of those firms have de-registered with the CFTC. I question if this is solely a coincidence. I am concerned that when faced with the choice whether to engage in business activity subject to CFTC oversight, firms would rather&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;participate in our markets than deal with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The CFTC should be promoting greater access to markets&mdash;not limiting access. In the last several years, customers and clients now have less choice of market participants to conduct trading because of the de-registration of IBs. Fewer market participants leads to less liquidity and less efficient markets. As the saying goes, &ldquo;people vote with their feet.&rdquo; The Commission would do well to listen to what the public is saying.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders TD Bank And Cowen To Pay Civil Monetary Penalties For Recordkeeping And Supervision Failures For Firm-Wide Use Of Unapproved Communication Methods</title>

<div> enforcement, CFTC, TD Bank, Cowen, recordkeeping
Summary:<br /> The CFTC fined TD Bank $75 million and Cowen $3 million for failing to maintain required records and supervise business activities. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued two orders simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;The Toronto Dominion Bank&nbsp;(TD Bank), a swap dealer, and against&nbsp;Cowen and Company&nbsp;(Cowen), previously registered with the CFTC as an introducing broker, for failing to maintain and preserve records that were required to be kept under CFTC recordkeeping requirements and failing to diligently supervise matters related to their businesses as CFTC registrants.</p>
<p>The orders require TD Bank to pay a $75 million civil monetary penalty, and Cowen to pay a $3 million civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;Both admit the facts detailed in the orders, are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of recordkeeping and supervision requirements, and are ordered to engage in specified remedial undertakings.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The orders find TD Bank from at least 2015 to the present, and Cowen from at least 2019 to February 2024, failed to stop employees, including those at senior levels, from communicating using unapproved communication methods, including messages sent via personal text. The firms were required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firms&rsquo; CFTC-registered businesses.&nbsp;These written communications generally were not maintained and preserved by the firms, and neither firm generally would have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each order further finds the use of unapproved communication methods violated each firm&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures, which generally prohibited business-related communication taking place via unapproved methods. Further, some of the same supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with the firms&rsquo; policies and procedures also used non-approved methods of communication to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy.</p>
<p>Since December 2021, the CFTC has imposed $1.202 billion in civil monetary penalties on 24 financial institutions for their use of unapproved methods of communication, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8470-21">8470-21</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8599-22">8599-22</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8699-23">8699-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8701-23">8701-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">8762-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8763-23">8763-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8794-23">8794-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8880-24">8880-24</a>]</p>
<p>Related Civil Actions</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission also announced today its filing and settling charges against affiliates of TD Bank and Cowen, and imposing civil monetary penalties for recordkeeping and supervision violations related to the use of unapproved methods of communication.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff responsible for these actions are Penina Moisa; Andrew Rodgers; Devin Cain; Alejandra de Urioste; R. Stephen Painter, Jr.; Lenel Hickson, Jr.; and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

<title>US Treasury Unveils New CFIUS Enforcement Website To Provide Further Clarity And Transparency Regarding CFIUS Penalties And Other Enforcement Actions - In 2023 And To Date In 2024, CFIUS Has Issued Three Times More Penalties Than It Had In The Previous Nearly 50-Years Since Its Establishment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, in a continuing evolution and sharpening of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) as a critical national security tool, and in furtherance of greater transparency, the Treasury Department updated the CFIUS website to share more details and guidance with the public and the investing community about how CFIUS approaches compliance and enforcement, as well as a list of its penalty actions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In the last few years, CFIUS has redoubled its resources and focus on enforcement and accountability, and that is by design: if CFIUS requires companies to make certain commitments to protect national security and they fail to do so, there must be consequences,&rdquo; said Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment Security Paul Rosen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s penalty updates underscore CFIUS&rsquo;s commitment to accountability and the protection of national security.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States.&nbsp; The Treasury Department chairs CFIUS.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The website update shares detailed information about all of the civil monetary penalties imposed by CFIUS over the last few years, including the largest penalty CFIUS has ever issued.&nbsp; For each penalty action, CFIUS is providing added transparency by describing the nature of the conduct that gave rise to the penalty and mitigating and aggravating factors, among other details, where applicable and consistent with the CFIUS&rsquo;s confidentiality obligations.&nbsp; In 2023 and 2024 to date, CFIUS has issued three times more penalties than CFIUS had previously issued in its nearly 50-year history.</span></p>

<title>Grace And Grit, Remarks Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, Recipient Of The 2024 Belva Ann Lockwood Award, The George Washington University Law School And Law Association Of Women</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span>Thank you so very much for this incredible honor, and to everyone who is here today. It really means a lot to me. I want to thank The George Washington University Law School, Dean Dayna Bowen Matthew, Associate Dean Rosa Celario and Professor Dalia Mitchell, the Law Association of Women and Gavi Kalaga and Shelby Amato, and of course the Belva Ann Lockwood Society for the very kind introductions, for this award and recognition, and for providing a forum to lift up women in law. I am grateful to you all for your commitment to telling our story and celebrating women&rsquo;s achievements. It is truly humbling to be this year&rsquo;s honoree for reflecting the character, determination, and attributes of Belva Ann Lockwood&mdash;GW Law&rsquo;s first alumna, a suffragette and leader for women&rsquo;s rights, the first woman to argue a case before the Supreme Court of the United States, and a U.S. Presidential candidate in 1884 and 1888. Undoubtedly, she accomplished all these &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; with both grace and grit while staying true to her values and beliefs.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>It is a tremendous honor to be in the storied company of Belva Ann Lockwood and the women trailblazers who are past recipients of this award. I am particularly awed by some of my fellow regulators who have been recognized. I would first like to note that I am not the first U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recipient of this prestigious award. Mary Schapiro, who was the Chairman of the CFTC from 1994 to 1996, is the first woman to chair the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the first person to chair the SEC and CFTC, and&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>person to lead both of those agencies as well as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). She is an incredible leader who left her mark on not only these venerable institutions, but also the markets through rapid changes and many challenges. Wilma Liebman chaired the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the second woman to hold that post. Margaret Richardson was also the second woman to helm the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Marybeth Peters served the public trust for a remarkable 45 years, including 16 years as the U.S. Register of Copyrights. And I am proud to be the first Vietnamese-American woman nominated by the President to a Senate-confirmed position in the executive branch of government. Today, as a recipient of the 2024 Belva Ann Lockwood Award, I am so honored to be counted among this truly inspiring group of women.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would not be here today if it were not for the support of those near and dear to me, many of whom are in the audience. I want to thank my team who enables me to do my job every day&mdash;Meghan Tente, Harry Jung, Taylor Foy, Nick Elliot, former team member Keaghan Ames, and one of our current GW Law interns, Eryn Lin. Thank you to my mentors, friends, classmates, and former colleagues that are also here, including my former GW Law mentees. I am especially grateful that my parents were able to make the trip from California to be here. I have my family to thank for instilling the values of hard work, excellence, and integrity throughout my life. I am sure that these values contributed to Belva Ann Lockwood&rsquo;s success as she blazed a trail for all women, and particularly those of us passionate about the law and public service.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I hope that my story shows the power of hope and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving your goals. Almost 50 years ago, my parents were airlifted by helicopter from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon on the last day of the Vietnam War, April 30, 1975. They left behind everything they had to start over in a new country and create a better future for their children. In the face of these challenges, my family resolved to write their own story, which of course required perseverance, resilience, and a healthy dose of optimism. I have been so impressed by their success and their civic leadership in our local community. My parents instilled in me a deep sense of service and giving back, and that is why I am able to stand here in front of you today.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As a young child growing up in Modesto, California in the &lsquo;80s, I was often the only Asian-American in my classes and definitely the only child of refugees from an unpopular war. This brought its own challenges, but it also taught me important lessons about strength and independence. I decided early on that the best way to overcome challenges as a young woman of color was to outwork and outperform, and to do so with the highest level of integrity. I am blessed to have been raised by such great role models, who taught me how to navigate adversity with grace and grit. And I am grateful for the support of my brothers who always pushed me and supported me along the way.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>These lessons served me well in school at UCLA and right here at GW Law. It was a challenge starting law school by taking night classes while I worked full-time during the day. I want to give a shout-out to the other members of Section 21 who have risen to incredible professional accomplishments, in the White House, as partners at law firms, and in all their endeavors.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Law school is a wonderful time, but it too can be full of challenges. Many of you in this room are in the process of preparing for the rest of your lives. The decisions you make today can determine career paths for a lifetime. Maybe you are juggling classes and a job or a child or other responsibilities. In these challenging moments, it can start to feel overwhelming. That is where strong support systems come in. Student organizations like the Law Association of Women are essential to providing such a network. Rarely does anyone make it to the top by themselves&mdash;it takes a team. Lean on your family, friends, teachers, mentors, classmates, and colleagues, because we are all on this journey together.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Take advantage of the opportunities of going to law school here in Washington, like having internships in the federal government and having a front-row seat to policymaking. It was incredible for me to go to law school during the 2008 financial crisis and do research right here at GW Law on the Dodd-Frank Act&mdash;the greatest piece of financial regulatory reform our country has seen since the Great Depression.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I want to recognize and thank two of my GW Law professors that shaped my career and to whom I am forever grateful. Professor Art Wilmarth taught banking law and encouraged me to seek a career in financial regulation. He was a true leader in the faculty and as the executive director for the Center for Law, Economics, and Finance (C-LEAF), which I became involved in as a law student and later as a visiting fellow. Professor John Buchman was an adjunct professor and a former advisory board chair who was a big supporter of C-LEAF and his students. The annual GW Law Dodd-Frank Symposium featured prominently in thought leadership on financial regulatory reform, and one of the highlights for me was when I met former Fed Chair Paul Volcker and he also encouraged me to pursue public service.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I complemented my law school education with internships at the CFTC and SEC in the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Enforcement &amp; Compliance Division to see laws and regulations put into action, in addition to my time at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Then, I interned during my last year of law school for former CFTC Commissioner Scott O&rsquo;Malia, later returning as special counsel. I worked on some of the CFTC&rsquo;s most consequential rulemakings to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule and the first comprehensive regulatory framework for swaps. These sweeping regulations impact not just U.S. markets, but they also impact and shape global markets. My experiences at the CFTC were the inflection point for my entire career, and I want to thank Commissioner O&rsquo;Malia for the opportunity to learn about the lasting impact of policy decisions and putting the public interest first.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Fast forward to my career in the legal and financial services fields&mdash;professions that have their own history and challenges when it comes to women leaders and people of color. I have found that the lessons from my childhood continue to serve me well today.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Hard work. Excellence. Integrity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>These values can help you to achieve your personal ambitions. Whether it is in school or your career, I encourage you to look at every challenge as an opportunity to achieve new heights, even if they seem unobtainable. But it is not always about you or me. Sharing these values can have a compounding effect on the world around us. Belva Ann Lockwood was dedicated to using her talents as a teacher and as a legal scholar to recognize injustice around her and to do something about it. To speak up for what is right. To lead by example, and to inspire others.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>That is why I have made it a focus in all of my leadership roles to share my experiences and mentor a younger generation&mdash;at GW Law, the American Bar Association, Citigroup, and now at the CFTC. It is so important that we as leaders set a high bar when it comes to our organization&rsquo;s culture: one that is open-minded, encourages participation, and celebrates diversity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I encourage you to know your core values and always commit to doing the right thing, no matter how challenging it may be. Do it with grace and grit, and this foundation will take you far. In the face of adversity, your first principles will serve as a north star. And combined with hope and perseverance, I believe you can open doors that were once locked for generations.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>No doubt the world is a much different place since Belva Ann Lockwood broke glass ceiling after glass ceiling. Just look at the CFTC. Women on the Commission outnumber the men 4-to-1! I am grateful to work with such dedicated public servants and want to recognize Commissioner Mersinger, Commissioner Goldsmith Romero, Commissioner Johnson, and Chairman Behnam.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We are all better off thanks to the women who came before us, but that does not mean we cannot aim higher. We should always strive for greater fairness and greater opportunity for women. We can always do better to celebrate our differences.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You all have the gift of going to law school in our Nation&rsquo;s capital and witnessing history in the making. The education and experiences you gain today will enable your success in the future. I cannot wait to see what you accomplish&mdash;with grace and grit.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>SIFMA: Court Strikes Down Missouri Rules That Violate Federal Law And Grants Statewide Permanent Injunction</title>

<div> ruling, SIFMA, Missouri, investment, financial<br />
<br />
Summary: SIFMA won a court ruling against Missouri's disclosure and consent rules for financial professionals, deeming them unconstitutional and preempted by federal laws. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today a federal court in Missouri issued a final ruling in favor of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) on its legal challenge to two newly enacted Missouri disclosure and consent rules.</p>
<p>The rules required financial professionals who consider &ldquo;a social objective or other nonfinancial objective&rdquo; in their investment advice to disclose this to their customers and obtain the customers&rsquo; written consent to state-mandated language in the rules. The rules characterized a &ldquo;nonfinancial&rdquo; objectives as anything other than maximal &ldquo;financial return,&rdquo; and the court agreed with SIFMA that the rules could easily be read to encompass objectives that are routinely part of investment decisions, such as tax considerations, diversification, risk tolerance, time horizon, liquidity needs, faith or values-based objectives, and local community investment objectives, among others.</p>
<p>The court ruled in favor of SIFMA on all counts. The court issued a declaratory judgment stating that &ldquo;the Rules are preempted by [National Securities Markets Improvements Act (NSMIA)] and [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)], are unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and are impermissibly vague under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.&rdquo; The court also ordered a statewide permanent injunction prohibiting the implementation, application, or enforcement of the rules.</p>
<p>SIFMA&rsquo;s President and CEO, Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., remarked: &ldquo;Congress enacted NSMIA to alleviate the redundant, costly, and ineffective dual federal/state regulation of our securities market system. Today&rsquo;s ruling was necessary to prevent Missouri from violating NSMIA, among other things, and from hindering communications between Missouri investors and the financial professionals who serve them. This decision marks a major victory not only for our national securities market system, but also for our nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bentsen continued: &ldquo;Under today&rsquo;s federal securities laws, financial professionals are already required to provide investment advice and recommendations that are in their customers&rsquo; best interest. That means they cannot put their interests ahead of their customers&rsquo; interests when recommending securities. The Missouri rules were thus unnecessary and created confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<div> position limits, Vitol, CFTC, enforcement, penalty
Summary:
The CFTC orders Vitol to pay a penalty for exceeding position limits on crude oil and live cattle futures contracts. <div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against&nbsp;<span>Vitol, Inc.</span>, based in Houston, Texas, and its affiliate,&nbsp;<span>Vitol SA</span>, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland<span>&nbsp;</span>(collectively Vitol)<span>&nbsp;</span>for exceeding the CFTC&rsquo;s position limits on aggregate positions across multiple exchanges in contracts that reference crude oil futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and for exceeding the CFTC&rsquo;s position limits in live cattle futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The order requires Vitol to pay a $500,000 civil monetary penalty.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">This marks the CFTC&rsquo;s first use of its authority to enforce position limits on aggregate positions held on multiple exchanges. In addition to imposing a penalty, the order requires Vitol to cease and desist from further violations of Sections 4a(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulation 150.2, as charged.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">&ldquo;Federal position limits are important and are in place to prevent this sort of manipulation,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action shows the CFTC will use its ability to look at positions on and across exchanges to enforce compliance and protect the integrity of the futures markets.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN">Case Background</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The CFTC established federal speculative position limits for certain physical-delivery referenced contracts, including the NYMEX Physically Settled West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil contract (CL). For financially-settled options referencing the CL contract, applicable positions are determined by converting the options into their futures equivalents and aggregating those equivalents across a firm&rsquo;s various positions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The order finds on May 17, 2022, Vitol held positions in financially-settled calendar spread options traded on NYMEX and ICE Futures Energy Division (IFED) exchanges that referenced the CL contract equivalent to 7,484 CL contracts, 1,484 contracts over the federal speculative limit of 6,000. On May 18, 2022, Vitol held a position equivalent of 7,091 contracts, 2,091 contracts over that day&rsquo;s federal speculative limit of 5,000. On June 15, 2022, Vitol held a position equivalent to 6,074 contracts, 74 contracts over the federal speculative limit of 6,000. And on June 16, 2022, Vitol held a position equivalent to 6,594, 1,594 contracts over that day&rsquo;s federal speculative limit of 5,000.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN">The order also finds on December 5, 2022, Vitol held 771 December 2022 CME Live Cattle Futures contracts. The position exceeded by 171 the federal spot month speculative position limit of 600 contracts.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Trevor Kokal, Michael P. Geiser, Carrie Kennedy, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

It will replace the existing individual collateral management systems belonging to the national central banks of the euro area countries.</p>
<h2>Annex</h2>
<p>The harmonised rules and arrangements for the mobilisation and management of collateral in Eurosystem credit operations reflect the following developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the implementation of a Eurosystem policy establishing that assets mobilised as collateral will be held in accounts in TARGET2-Securities (T2S);</li>
<li>the adoption of market standards relevant for Eurosystem collateral management, as set out in the Single Collateral Management Rulebook for Europe (SCoRE);</li>
<li>updates to the eligibility criteria applicable to securities settlement systems (SSSs), links between SSSs and triparty agents (TPAs);</li>
<li>the alignment of domestic and cross-border handling procedures;</li>
<li>the implementation of a single operational method &ndash; pooling &ndash; for maintaining collateral mobilised by Eurosystem counterparties;</li>
<li>the adoption of a harmonised approach for recovering external costs charged by central securities depositories (CSDs) and TPAs from counterparties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The General Documentation has been amended to take account of Guideline ECB/2024/22 and implements certain other changes relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the prioritisation of credit assessments from the national central banks&rsquo; in-house credit assessment systems (ICASs), where available, over those from other credit assessment systems for the provision of credit assessment of debtors and guarantors of credit claims used to determine the eligibility of the credit claim and the applicable valuation haircuts;</li>
<li>the provision of greater clarity in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF) with regard to the acceptance of local currency and foreign currency ratings from external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs);</li>
<li>the expression in face amount (FAMT) of the quantity of debt instruments to be eligible as collateral and comply with market standards for the denomination of securities.</li>
</ul>

<title>SEC Charges Russell Todd Burkhalter And His Atlanta-Based Firm With $300 Million Ponzi Scheme And Obtains Emergency Relief - Burkhalter Allegedly Stole Investor Funds To Buy A $3.1 Million Yacht And Fund Lavish Lifestyle</title>

<div> Ponzi scheme, SEC, asset freeze, real estate, injunction
Summary: SEC halts $300 million real estate Ponzi scheme, freezes assets of Drive Planning LLC and CEO, who misappropriated funds. Receiver appointed. Investors impacted. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it obtained a preliminary injunction, asset freeze, and other emergency relief against Atlanta-based Drive Planning LLC and its founder and CEO, Russell Todd Burkhalter, to halt a $300 million real estate Ponzi scheme impacting more than 2,000 investors. Additionally, a receiver was appointed over Drive Planning. The SEC alleges the defendants misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds to fund Burkhalter&rsquo;s lavish lifestyle and to make Ponzi-like payments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive Planning and Burkhalter gained the trust of everyday people and encouraged them to invest in this scheme by promising exorbitant returns, but as our complaint alleges, the defendants&rsquo; business was nothing more than a classic Ponzi scheme, using new investor money to pay returns to existing investors, with Burkhalter stealing millions to fund a lavish lifestyle,&rdquo; said Nekia Hackworth Jones, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Atlanta Regional Office. &ldquo;Investors should be vigilant when they encounter aggressive sellers who make over-the-top sales pitches and promise high rates of guaranteed returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that, from 2020 through at least June 2024, Drive Planning and Burkhalter raised more than $300 million for purported real estate investments, telling investors their money would be used to fund land development projects. The defendants promised 10% interest every 3 months and encouraged investors to tap their savings, retirement accounts, and even open lines of credit to invest. In reality, the defendants did not have a business capable of generating the promised returns, and they instead used investor funds to make Ponzi-like payments, according to the complaint. The complaint further alleges that Burkhalter stole investor funds to fund his luxurious lifestyle, including to buy a $3.1 million yacht and spending $4.6 million on chartering private jets and luxury car services and $2 million on a luxury condo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges Drive Planning and Burkhalter with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition to the emergency relief granted by the Court, which the defendants did not oppose, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants, and an officer-and-director bar against Burkhalter.&nbsp;The complaint also names Jacqueline Burkhalter, Burkhalter&rsquo;s spouse, and several related entities as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Austin Stephenson and Cody Turley, under the supervision of Peter Diskin and Justin Jeffries, of the SEC&rsquo;s Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Pat Huddleston and H.B. Roback, under the supervision of M. Graham Loomis.</p>

<div> July, CUSIP, issuance, corporate, municipal
<br /><br />Summary:
July CUSIP issuance report shows a slowdown in new corporate and municipal identifiers. Year-over-year, international debt requests are up significantly. <div>
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=76m1CH5vMIGg2YzJcCJs12ebizRAvUb_9k1sP1qs3KALvPiYomf64Cwii8m2Hcrj53lC4Ne23uNAEe3gjiFA0KHfxq-8cOHohMpN0VYcuHHXYEYQIeJmyGJUzRewRtMn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CUSIP Global Services</span></a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for July 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a slowdown in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers for a second consecutive month.</p>
<p align="start">North American corporate requests totaled 6,391 in July, which is down 2.6% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 7.9%. The monthly volume decline was driven by a 15.6% decrease in request volume for U.S. corporate debt and a 21.1% decrease in volume for Canadian corporate securities. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-10.1%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-10.2%) also slowed in July.</p>
<p align="start">The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 18.1% versus June totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 7.6%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 180 new CUSIP requests in July, followed by New York (161) and California (67).</p>
<p align="start">&ldquo;While new issuance volume is still up year-over-year across the majority of asset classes, we are starting to see more frequent slowdowns on a month-to-month basis,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;The jury is still out on whether that monthly volatility represents a significant trend or just a mid-summer blip in activity. We will continue to monitor CUSIP request volumes closely for any signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="start">Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 1.7% in July and international debt CUSIP requests rose 14.8%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 4.8% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 113.3%.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines And Bans Martin Sarl For Dishonest And Reckless Conduct</title>

<div> banned, financial services, dishonesty, client money, insurance<br />
Summary:<br />
Martin Sarl banned from financial services for misuse of client money, leaving customers uninsured and lying to cover it up. Firm entered liquidation. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has banned Martin Sarl from working in the financial services industry and fined him &pound;5,021 for acting without honesty and integrity.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between 7 November 2017 and 24 October 2019, Mr Sarl, who was the sole director at Perry Prowse (Insurance Consultants) Ltd, failed to pass clients&rsquo; premiums to insurers, meaning that some customers were left uninsured without their knowledge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA's investigation uncovered that Mr Sarl used money from the firm&rsquo;s client account to pay both his personal debt, and that of the firm. That was not allowed under the FCA&rsquo;s Client Money rules, and these funds should have been kept separate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, there was not enough money to transfer the premiums - that his customers had paid to him - to insurers, leaving customers without cover and at risk of having their home, and car insurance claims rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When he was asked questions by customers about their insurance, Mr Sarl hid the truth, even going as far as blaming a false 'IT glitch'. In at least one instance, a customer had a claim rejected because they did not have cover in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint head of Enforcement and Market oversight at the FCA said</span>:</p>
<p>'Mr Sarl's customers trusted him to keep their money safe and to secure the insurance cover they needed. Instead he helped himself to prop up his business and personal finances. He compounded this by lying to his customers.</p>
<p>'This left many people at risk of being unable to make a claim should they have needed to. It is right that Mr Sarl should be banned from the industry'.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/martin-christopher-sarl-2024.pdf" title="martin-christopher-sarl-2024.pdf">Final Notice 2024: Martin Christopher Sarl (PDF)</a></li>
<li>The FCA has imposed a financial penalty on Mr Sarl for &pound;5,021 for his failure to comply with Statement of Principle 1 pursuant to section 66 of the Act. Mr Sarl&rsquo;s penalty was reduced from &pound;63,600 as Mr Sarl provided evidence that the payment of &pound;63,600 would cause him serious financial hardship. The penalty was reduced to &pound;5,021 as this is the amount that Authority considers was the financial benefit derived directly from his breaches and it would not be appropriate to allow him to retain this benefit.</li>
<li>As a result of the actions of Mr Sarl, the FCA finds that he is not a fit and proper person to perform any function in relation to any regulated activities carried on by any authorised or exempt person or exempt professional firm, and the FCA withdraws the approval for Mr Sarl to perform the function of SMF3 Executive Director at Perry Prowse.</li>
<li>On 13 September 2019, the FCA took action to vary Perry Prowse&rsquo;s permission to remove all of its regulated activities with immediate effect. On 15 January 2020, the firm entered into liquidation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The customer whose insurance claim was refused because they did not have insurance in place was later reimbursed through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</li>
<li>The Client Money Rules require firms to calculate the amount of client money that should be segregated in a separate client bank account. Firms must segregate the client money until the premium is either paid to the insurer or client money is paid out to a client.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms must always hold the right amount of client money in a segregated client bank account to avoid a shortfall occurring. The FCA continues to take failures to segregate appropriately seriously as this action shows.</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines FXTB For Unfair Customer Treatment Practices</title>

<div> CFD, FXTB, FCA, fine, investment advice
<br />
FXTB fined £276,100 by FCA for pressuring customers into CFD trading, providing unauthorized investment advice, and exploiting inexperienced traders.<br /><br />Summary: The FCA fined FXTB for pressuring customers into CFD trading, providing unauthorized investment advice, and exploiting inexperienced traders, resulting in a £276,100 fine. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Cypriot contract for differences (CFD) firm Forex TB Limited (FXTB) &pound;276,100 for failing to treat its customers fairly, and for providing investment advice without being authorised to do so.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>CFDs are complex leveraged financial products used to speculate on the movement in prices on a wide range of assets. As a result, they carry a considerable risk of substantial losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FXTB pressured customers to put their money at risk through CFD trading, even encouraging them to borrow money from friends or family in some cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compounding these failings, FXTB frequently provided its customers with investment advice, despite not being authorised to do so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FXTB&rsquo;s customers were inexperienced in trading and did not always understand the risks associated with CFDs, which were also not fully explained to them. FXTB also enabled customers to become 'Professional Clients' by encouraging them to provide false information. This meant these consumers lost the protections that as &lsquo;retail clients&rsquo; they would have had. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA required FXTB to stop providing services to UK consumers on 12 April 2021. No business in the UK has been conducted by FXTB since this date. From 10 October 2023, FXTB no longer held any FCA permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said</span>: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'FXTB&rsquo;s misconduct was particularly egregious since it relied on the exploitation of customers who, because of their inexperience, were particularly vulnerable. By intervening early in April 2021, we helped prevent further consumer losses.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA would have imposed a fine of &pound;1.215m, however FXTB demonstrated that this would cause it serious financial hardship.&nbsp;</p>

<li>FXTB also traded as Patron FX.</li>
<li>The FCA encourages any customer of FXTB who believes they experienced behaviour as set out in the Final Notice to make a complaint to FXTB as a means of seeking compensation.</li>
<li>The FCA has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-bars-cypriot-firms-used-unauthorised-celebrity-endorsements" title="FCA bars Cypriot firms that used unauthorised celebrity endorsements">taken action</a>&nbsp;in 2020 to stop 4 Cypriot investment firms from continuing to offer high risk CFDs to UK investors. Moreover, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-places-restrictions-twice-many-consumer-investment-firms-year" title="FCA places restrictions on twice as many consumer investment firms this year">stopped</a>&nbsp;the UK operations of a further 16 CFD providers that had entered the UK&rsquo;s temporary permissions regime in 2021.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the context of CFDs, a client opting up to Professional Client status is able to trade on higher leverage / put up less margin to support a position of a given size. This increases potential profits but also potential losses. Clients moving to Professional Client status waive some protections afforded to retail clients.</li>

<title>ACER To Decide On Amending The Methodology For Harmonising Cross-Zonal Electricity Balancing Capacity Allocation</title>

<div> methodology, cross-zonal capacity, balancing capacity, TSOs, ACER
Summary: 
ACER received a request to amend the methodology for cross-zonal capacity allocation to integrate balancing capacity markets, lower costs, and ensure supply security. Stakeholder consultation and decision-making will follow.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>On 31 July 2024, ACER received a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXUFcCV1RRBkwIBAcAHVYJBw4dCggJVRoCBwAEUQNXBg9XVQIdVlFSWAwABgIdA10MAB0GCQQFGlddAgcZVQFUAwUFAFEDVlZSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>&nbsp;from Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBCFdSWAQFV0xYU1ZRHVYLBQIdCgEFABoHA1EFUlYBDwdQA1IdVlFSWAwABgIdA10MAB0GCQQFGlddAgcZVQFUAwUFAFEDVlZSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">harmonised methodology for cross-zonal capacity allocation for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>This methodology provides a harmonised approach for effective allocation of cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves. Having an optimised allocation of cross-zonal capacity is important to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foster the integration of balancing capacity markets.</li>
<li>Lower the costs of procuring balancing capacity (hence the costs for tariff payers).</li>
<li>Ensure the security of electricity supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the methodology?</span></p>

<p>Highlighting the month's performance, Croatia's Zagrebacka Burza dd emerged as the standout player, achieving a remarkable 31.9% increase in share price from July 1 to July 31, 2024. Nasdaq followed suit with a 12.5% rise, while Israel's Tel Aviv Stock Exchange enjoyed an 11.5% increase during the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Conversely, Poland's Warsaw Stock Exchange faced challenges, recording the steepest decline with an 11.3% drop in share prices. The Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB de CV saw an 8.1% decrease, and Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing experienced a 7.4% decline.</p>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index commented on the competitive landscape: "LSEG, whose shares have increased by 2.9% this year, is steadily closing the gap with ICE and CME in the race to become the leading exchange by market cap. The collaboration between LSEG and Microsoft is anticipated to yield significant results by year-end."</p>

<title>ASIC Sues ASX For Alleged Misleading Statements</title>

<div> proceedings, Federal Court, ASX Limited, misleading statements, ASIC <br />
Summary:<br />
ASIC alleges ASX made misleading statements about the CHESS replacement project, causing significant costs and lack of confidence in the market. ASX paid a penalty of $1,050,000. <div>
<p>ASIC has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against Australia&rsquo;s largest market operator, ASX Limited, for allegedly making misleading statements related to its Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) replacement project.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges statements made in ASX announcements on 10 February 2022 that the project remained &ldquo;on-track for go-live&rdquo; in April 2023 and was &ldquo;progressing well&rdquo; were misleading.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges these statements implied the project was tracking to ASX&rsquo;s announced project plan and was on track to meet future milestones, including &ldquo;go-live&rdquo; in April 2023. ASIC alleges those representations were misleading and deceptive because, at the time of the announcements, the project was not tracking to plan and ASX did not have any reasonable basis to imply the project was on track to meet future milestones.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;ASX&rsquo;s statements go to the heart of trust in the integrity of our markets. We believe this was a collective failure by the ASX Board and senior executives at the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Companies and market participants rely on what the ASX says about its operations to make their own decisions and investments. We expect the ASX to be a place to list and invest with confidence. When the ASX falls short, it has wide ranging consequences across the market.</p>
<p>Mr Longo said ASX&rsquo;s CHESS replacement is a technology project of fundamental significance, replacing critical national infrastructure crucial to the operation of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Its critical importance was all the more reason ASX needed to ensure it told the Australian public the truth about how the project was tracking and whether it would be completed on time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We allege that the true state of affairs as at 10 February 2022 was that the project was not &ldquo;progressing well&rdquo;, contrary to ASX&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The delay and subsequent pause of the project in November 2022 caused significant cost to ASX and market participants who relied on assurances as to the progress of the project and scheduled go-live date.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The CHESS replacement project must be managed effectively and transparently. Failure to do so can lead to a lack of confidence in Australia as a market to attract investment,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>ASIC is yet to determine the penalty it will seek for ASX's alleged contraventions.</p>
<p>On 7 March 2024, ASIC announced ASX had paid a penalty of $1,050,000 following an ASIC investigation into its compliance with the market integrity rules. More recently, ASIC took action against a &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; scheme and attempted manipulation of commodities markets. These proceedings underscore ASIC's commitment to ensuring all market participants comply with the law.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Ensuring the ASX has complied, and is complying, with its legal obligations is critically important to maintaining confidence in the integrity of the market given the important role ASX plays in developing and issuing recommendations on the corporate governance practices to be adopted by listed companies and is responsible for the governance of critical national infrastructure.</p>
<p>On 28 March 2022, approximately six weeks after making the statements, ASX announced that there was a strong likelihood of further delay to the go-live date of April 2023. Following that announcement, ASX engaged Accenture to undertake a review of the project.</p>
<p>That review identified significant challenges with the solution design and its ability to meet the ASX&rsquo;s requirements. Following the release of the Accenture Report, ASX decided to pause the project and wrote down costs of $250 million.</p>

<p>Chances are you may be watching this video because an AI-powered search algorithm suggested it to you.</p>
<p>How might similar algorithms affect your investment choices?</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is about using math, using data, using computational power to recognize patterns and make predictions.</p>
<p>Companies now can use it to narrow-cast in other words, to individually target or personalize a message, pricing, or products to each of us individually. In finance, robo-advisors and brokerage applications are using such algorithms.</p>
<p>Already we receive messages from AI-recommender systems, whether in finance or elsewhere, that are considering how we might as individuals respond to their prompts, respond to their products, respond to their pricing.</p>
<p>We all know some forms of these predictive data analytics well, it's all around us. The flashing buttons on our screen, the push notifications, the colors, the sounds, the well engineered subtleties of our modern digital life. If finance platforms figured out something else subtle about us, let's say maybe our color preferences.</p>
<p>Little story from my youth: my mom used to dress my identical twin brother Rob in red and me, Gary in green. Yeah, it's it's real. It's true. Today, I might not react as favorably to green prompts.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence systems can pick up on these subtle preferences. If their optimization function takes the interest of the platform, the robo-advisor, the brokerage app, into consideration as well as the interest of a customer this can lead to conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Well, in finance, when brokers or advisers act on those conflicts, and if they optimize to place their interest ahead of their investor&rsquo;s interest, investors may suffer financial harm.</p>
<p>Are investment firms sending me alerts that aren't green because somehow they&rsquo;ve figured out, that I might react in a different way, or because it might benefit the firm's revenues, profits or other interest at my expense?</p>
<p>Those who provide financial advice and recommendations, whether or not based on artificial intelligence, are still required to serve the best interest of the clients and retail customers.</p>
<p>We at the Securities and Exchange Commission are focused on how evolving artificial intelligence affects investors, affects issuers and the markets connecting them. That's why we proposed a rule last year regarding how best to address potential conflicts across a range of investor interactions, from robo-advisors to brokers.</p>

<div> Telecommunications, Nigeria, Economic growth, Capital market, Investment <br />
The telecommunications sector in Nigeria plays a vital role in the economy, requiring supportive policies, investments in infrastructure, and talent development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Industry leaders highlighted the telecommunications sector as a pivotal force in Nigeria's economic growth at a recent town hall event organized by Financial Derivatives Company (FDC). The event, themed "Telecoms Industry 2.0: The Next Investment Frontier in Nigeria," brought together key stakeholders to discuss the industry's critical role in shaping the future of the Nigerian capital market.</p>
<p>Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), underscored the significant impact of the telecommunications industry on capital market efficiency, transparency, and financial inclusion. "The telecommunications sector is not just about connectivity; it is a vital cog in the machinery that drives market transparency and informed decision-making," Popoola stated. He pointed out that two of the top five most capitalized companies on NGX are telecommunications giants, illustrating the deep-seated connection between the industry and the financial market.</p>
<p>Popoola emphasized that the influence of telecoms extends well beyond their primary services. "Their contributions extend beyond connectivity; they facilitate the dissemination of real-time market data, which is crucial for enhancing market transparency," he noted. He also discussed the synergistic relationship between the telecoms industry and the capital market, which fosters a robust ecosystem benefiting suppliers, partners, and investors.</p>
<p>The GMD/CEO stressed the importance of fostering an environment that encourages innovation, which he believes will drive further investment in infrastructure and talent development within the sector. He called for continued collaboration between the telecommunications industry and the financial markets to unlock new opportunities that would enhance both sectors.</p>
<p>Dr. Armstrong Takang, Managing Director/CEO of the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, represented the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy at the event. He echoed Popoola's sentiments, asserting the need for a supportive policy framework that could make the telecom industry even more attractive for investments. "With the right regulations and enabling policies, the telecommunications sector has the potential to become a cornerstone of Nigeria's economic future," Dr. Takang stated.</p>
<p>Adding to the discourse, Mr. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, called for a regulatory landscape that encourages telecom companies to leverage the capital markets. He stressed the importance of increased investments in infrastructure and a greater focus on talent development to ensure the industry's sustainable growth.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a consensus among stakeholders that a strategic mix of policies and enabling legislation will be vital in steering Nigeria's telecommunications industry towards long-term sustainability and making it a true investment frontier.</p>
<p>Telecommunications sector has been recognized as a significant contributor to Nigeria's economic growth since its liberalization in 2001. As the industry continues to evolve, its symbiotic relationship with the capital market and broader economy remains a focal point for policymakers and investors alike.</p>

<title>The EBA Sets 2025 Priorities For Resolution Authorities And Reports On The Progress Achieved In 2023</title>

<div> European Banking Authority, EREP Report, priorities, resolution authorities, banks <br />
Summary:<br />
The EBA published its EREP Report, setting priorities for resolution authorities and banks, including operationalizing resolution tools, liquidity strategies, and management information systems for valuation. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its European Resolution Examination Programme (EREP) Report. It sets three priorities for resolution authorities and banks for 2025: operationalisation of their resolution tools, liquidity strategies in resolution, and management information system for valuation. The Report also looks at the progress achieved in 2023 and identifies areas of improvement.</span></p>
<p>The 2025 EREP priorities confirm and complement the areas of focus set for 2024, given their relevance and the fact that work takes time on those complex topics. New elements introduced for 2025 reflect policy and market developments, progress and expertise gained by resolution authorities and, overall, embed a testing dimension which is considered central for resolution readiness.</p>
<p>Compared to 2024, building up own funds and eligible liabilities is not a separate priority anymore, given that most banks have met their minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). However, to increase the effectiveness of the bail-in tool, MREL qualitative aspects are to be further monitored as part of the operationalisation of resolution tools, and quantitative aspects will be followed and disclosed by the EBA in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/risk-analysis/risk-monitoring/mrel-dashboard">MREL Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>In 2023,&nbsp;convergence increased within the EU with regards to resolution planning practices and objectives.</p>
<p>On MREL, only four banks did not meet their target as of 1 January 2024. Resolution authorities have used their powers to impose sanctions and extended deadlines for 22&nbsp;institutions. They have also increased their monitoring of MREL eligibility and quality, especially for contracts governed by third-country law.</p>
<p>On the operationalisation of the bail-in tool, most&nbsp;resolution authorities have now published&nbsp;their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/resolution/guidelines-resolution-authorities-publication-their-approach-implementing-bail-tool">bail-in mechanics</a>&nbsp;and consider that challenges concerning the identification of holders of instruments, suspension for trading or requirements of issuing prospectus for the new instruments persist and are particularly prominent in relation to third country stakeholders.</p>
<p>While some progress has been observed in the area of liquidity in resolution, resolution authorities plan to further increase the intensity of their testing and to challenge the severity of banks&rsquo; scenarios.</p>
<p>Finally, resolution authorities have performed more testing of management information systems for valuation<span>&nbsp;</span>as some banks showed significant gaps in data quality, automation, granularity and timeliness of report delivery. Further progress remains needed. Resolution authorities have put in place procedures for quickly appointing a valuer. The EBA supports the work of resolution authorities and is preparing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-consults-handbook-independent-valuers-resolution-purposes">Handbook on the independence of valuers</a>&nbsp;currently under public consultation.</p>
<h5>Note to the editors</h5>
<p>According to Articles 25 and 29 of its founding Regulation, the EBA shall contribute to, and participate actively in, the development and coordination of effective, consistent and up-to-date recovery and resolution plans for financial institutions and shall also develop and maintain an up-to-date Union resolution handbook on the resolution of financial institutions in the Union.</p>
<p>The EBA fosters convergence in resolution practices by setting EREP priorities and publishing a report on an annual basis. The is the second edition of the EBA&rsquo;s EREP priorities and report.</p>
<p>The EREP priorities highlights the topics on which EU banks and resolution authorities need to pay special attention in the next calendar year. They are selected based on the expertise of the EBA and its members in policy development, on the practical experience of resolution authorities, and of the resolution colleges in which the EBA participates. The EBA subsequently assesses whether and how the selected topics have been taken into account in resolution authorities&rsquo; priorities and activities.</p>
<p>Separately, as part of its convergence mandate, the EBA sets priorities for banks and their supervisors on an annual basis in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/supervisory-convergence/european-supervisory-examination-programme-esep">European Supervisory Examination Programme (ESEP)</a>, which includes the key topics for heightened supervisory attention across the European Union. In addition, following the entry into force of the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, the EBA also set out&nbsp;<a href="">key topics for supervisory attention across the European Union&nbsp;in 2024/2025&nbsp;for issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs),</a>&nbsp;with the aim of promoting the timely and consistent application of MiCAR.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Final Draft Technical Standards On Market Risk As Part Of Its Roadmap For The Implementation Of The Banking Package In The EU</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> amendments, RTS, FRTB, CRR3, EBA
Summary: The EBA published final amendments to the RTS on FRTB to align with CRR3, including changes to profit and loss attribution test and risk factor modellability assessment. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published final amendments to its Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB). The revisions mostly aim to align these RTS with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and ensure stability in the applicable regulatory framework. The RTS are part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package"><span>roadmap on the Banking Package</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>The CRR3 introduced a number of changes to the FRTB and included mandates for the EBA to amend existing RTS for them to fit with the new Level 1 text. In particular, the EBA has been mandated to review the RTS on the treatment of foreign-exchange and commodity risk in the banking book, the RTS on profit and loss attribution test and the RTS on risk factor modellability assessment</p>
<p>As regards the details on the profit and loss attribution test, the RTS remove the aggregation formula for computing the total own funds requirements for market risk for an institution using the alternative internal model approach as this formula has been now introduced in the CRR3.</p>
<p>As regards the risk factors&rsquo; modellability assessment, the RTS ensure that institutions are able to identify how far they rely on a third-party vendor for the purpose of assessing the modellability of a risk factor.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the treatment of foreign exchange and commodity risk in the non-trading book, the RTS ensure that translation risk is duly captured by institutions.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>The draft RTS have been developed according to Article 325(9), 325be(3) and 325bg(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3, which mandates the EBA to specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>how institutions are to calculate the own funds requirements for market risk for non-trading book positions that are subject to foreign-exchange risk or commodity risk;</li>
<li>how institutions are to assess the risk factors&rsquo; modellability;</li>
<li>technical details relating to the profit and loss attribution tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EBA roadmap also outlines the EBA&rsquo;s intentions and plan of action to ensure a smooth implementation of the new approaches across the EU. In particular, it reflects the prioritisation of the EBA&rsquo;s work in four phases, which is broadly in line with the deadlines included in the CRR3, starting with the implementation of the essential parts of the framework.</p>

<div> Denmark, Portugal, Germany, Italy, macroprudential measures
<br />
FI reciprocates Denmark's 7% sectoral systemic risk buffer. It does not reciprocate similar measures in Portugal, Germany, and Italy. 
Summary: 
FI reciprocates Denmark's 7% buffer. It does not reciprocate Portugal's, Germany's, or Italy's measures due to insignificant Swedish exposures. <div>
<p><span>Finansinspektionen has passed decisions concerning reciprocation of macroprudential measures in Denmark, Portugal, Germany and Italy.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>FI has passed a decision to reciprocate The Ministry of industry's decision to implement a 7 percent sectoral systemic risk buffer for exposures to real estate companies in Denmark. In accordance with the threshold set by The Ministry of industry the decision applies to Swedish institutions where said exposures exceed EUR 200 billion. The decision will apply from the 31st of Oktober 2024.</p>
<p>In Portugal the central bank has passed a decision to introduce a systemic risk buffer of 4 percent for retail exposures to natural persons secured by residential immovable property for which the collateral is located in Portugal. The buffer applies to institutions using internal models (IRB institutions). FI has decided not to reciprocate the Portugal measure as Swedish IRB institutions relevant exposures are insignificant.</p>
<p>In Germany the supervisory authority (Bafin) has decided to maintain a 2 percent sectoral systemic risk buffer for retail exposures and corporate exposures secured by residential immovable property for which the collateral is located in Germany. FI has decided not to reciprocate the German measure as Swedish institutions relevant exposures are insignificant.</p>
<p>In Italy the central bank has passed a decision to introduce a systemic risk buffer of 7 percent for credit and counterparty credit risk exposures. FI has decided not to reciprocate the Italian measure as Swedish institutions relevant exposures are insignificant.</p>
<h2>Reciprocation of macroprudential measures in other countries</h2>
<p>According to the capital adequacy regulations (Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements Directive), a country can ask other countries to reciprocate adopted macroprudential measures. If Sweden decides to reciprocate another Member State's measures, this means that affected Swedish exposures in that country will be covered by the measure.</p>

<title>ESAs’ Joint Board Of Appeal Allows The Appeal Lodged By NOVIS And Remits The Case To EIOPA</title>

<div> admissible, appeal, documents, access, EIOPA
Summary:<br /> The Board found NOVIS's appeal admissible regarding access to documents from EIOPA, acknowledging exceptions but remitting the case for an amended decision. <div>
<div class="node__content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Joint Board of Appeal (&ldquo;The Board&rdquo;) of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the EBA, ESMA and EIOPA) unanimously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-08/BoA-D-2024-05_Board_of_Appeal_-_NOVIS_v_EIOPA_-_Decision.pdf">decided</a>&nbsp;that the appeal brought by NOVIS against the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is admissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The appeal was brought in relation to the EIOPA decision not to grant access to documents, which were requested by NOVIS.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its decision, the Board acknowledges that requests for access to documents laid out in Regulation No 1049/2001 can be dismissed by way of exceptions to protect certain public and private interests.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In the context of this appeal, the Board confirms that for certain documents targeted by NOVIS&rsquo; request, there may be good reasons to refuse access in order to protect the proper functioning of the European System of Financial Supervision (&ldquo;ESFS&rdquo;). The Board concurs with EIOPA that there must be a &ldquo;safe space&rdquo;, comprising all supervisory authorities that are part of the ESFS, where all potential options and ideas can be discussed freely without public disclosure. Nevertheless, the Board also concludes that for two documents, partial access may have been granted.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">As a result, the Board remits the case to EIOPA for the adoption of an amended decision.</p>

<div> Bitcoin, Ether, Spectrum Markets, SERIX sentiment, retail investors<br />
Summary:<br />
Bullish sentiment for Bitcoin and Ether, driven by political endorsements, Russian government decisions, ETF launches, and EIB's Ether-based bond issuance. Spectrum's SERIX data reveals retail investor sentiment. <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Markets&rsquo; SERIX sentiment shows a bullish trend for both Bitcoin and Ether, coinciding with price increases (BTC 59.728,2 EUR<sup>1</sup>; ETH 2.986,32 EUR<sup>2</sup>)</li>
<li>Endorsements from political figures such as Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with decisions by the Russian government, have boosted Bitcoin demand</li>
<li>Ether&rsquo;s rising demand is driven by increased institutional interest, including ETF launches and the European Investment Bank&rsquo;s (EIB) Ether-based bond issuance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for July, revealing a bullish trend for both cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ether. The SERIX value for Bitcoin remained stable at a high level with 107 points (down from 108 on June), while the value for Ether increased from 110 to 113 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<h4>Market opinion</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The bullish trading behaviour, alongside rising prices in July &ndash; appears to be backed by recent statements from the U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who promised to transform the United States into a &lsquo;global crypto currency capital and bitcoin superpower&rsquo; with prospects of Bitcoin-friendly regulations if elected. Trump announced plans to stop selling confiscated Bitcoin stocks and establish a &lsquo;strategic Bitcoin reserve&rsquo;. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. went even further, advocating for the daily purchase of 550 Bitcoins by the U.S. government to fund a substantial Bitcoin reserve. Additionally, the Russian government&rsquo;s legalisation of Bitcoin for export trade payments to counteract Western sanctions has likely been seen by retail investors worldwide as a strong signal, potentially fueling demand. However, the abrupt drop in price of Bitcoin and Ether in early August, took many investors by surprise, highlighting once again the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market&rdquo;, says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In terms of Ether, the bullish sentiment may be driven by the approval of nine Ether ETFs, which began trading on July 23<sup>rd</sup>. The European Investment Bank&rsquo;s (EIB) issuance of its first digital bond also contributed as another factor. Despite Bitcoin's advancements, many investors tend to favour Ether due to technological improvements such as &lsquo;staking,&rsquo; which allows for dividend payments. Ether is increasingly significant in decentralised finance and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), lowering the barrier for gaming and social media applications. So, at the end there is a strong supportive story also for Ether&rdquo;, Hall concludes.</p>
<h4>Spectrum&rsquo;s July data</h4>
<p>In July 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;240.3 million, with 36.3% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 77.2% on indices, 3.6% on currency pairs, 8.7% on commodities, 7.7% on equities and 2.8% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (29.4%), DAX 40 (25.1%), and DOW 30 (12%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 dropped from a bullish sentiment to a neutral 100, while the NASDAQ 100 increased from a bearish 99 to a neutral 100 as well DOW 30 remained bearish at 96.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<span>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Trustly, open banking, UK market, payment volumes, partnerships<br />
<br />
Summary: Trustly's payment volumes in the UK soared to £13.1bn in the first half of 2024, showcasing the growing adoption of open banking technology and strengthening partnerships.<br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><b>Trustly processed payments to the value of more than &pound;13.1bn between January to June in 2024</b></li>
<li><b>This marks a considerable increase relative to 2023, when Trustly handled &pound;13.6bn over the full year</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>13 August 2024 &ndash; London:&nbsp;</b>Trustly, the global leader in open banking payments, is continuing to strengthen its presence in the UK, building its relationships with key partners as payment volumes and the adoption of open banking technology accelerates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trustly provides consumers and merchants with a suite of payment products and data solutions, which aim to make online payments seamless, instant and secure. The company has been growing rapidly since its launch in 2008, currently partnering with 9,000 businesses across 33 markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this country specifically, Trustly has seen tremendous growth in recent years with transaction value soaring in the first half of 2024 and exceeding &pound;13bn. This represents a significant increase in comparison to 2023 when the company handled &pound;13.6bn for the entire year. Trustly&rsquo;s strong performance highlights the growing adoption of open banking more broadly, with one in nine people in the UK reportedly using open banking services as of October 2023<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trustly has been successful in developing its connections and partnerships across both the public and private sectors. The company&rsquo;s positive results demonstrate a clear acceleration in the adoption of open banking in the United Kingdom, with Trustly enabling organisations to enhance services for the country&rsquo;s consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trustly continues to strengthen its partnerships in the private sector, such as with Hargreaves Lansdown, ITV, MoneyGram and Booking.com. The acquisition of Ecospend, A Trustly Company, in 2023 has contributed to increasing Trustly&rsquo;s presence in the UK and rise of its market share.</p>
<p><b>Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond MBE, a Senior Adviser to Trustly, comments:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;It is exciting to see Trustly continue to expand its presence in the UK market. The strength of Trustly&rsquo;s partnerships across the private and public sector combined with the business&rsquo; exceptionally strong performance in recent months emphasises the accelerating adoption of open banking technology among consumers and merchants across the UK. The entire team at Trustly looks forward to continuing to provide our UK-based customers and partners with innovative payment solutions as we work towards making open banking payments a standard part of financial experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a strategic move to bolster its presence in the UK market, Trustly has appointed Mitchell Powers as Senior Vice President for the UK. Powers joins Trustly from GoCardless, where he most recently served as Vice President and General Manager. This appointment underscores Trustly's commitment to expanding its footprint and enhancing its service offerings in the UK.</p>
<p><b>Mitchell Powers, Senior Vice President at Trustly UK, comments:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Joining Trustly, the outright leader in this industry, is a proud moment for me. The company has gone from strength to strength over the past 12 months. This is demonstrated by its tremendous growth, world-first product rollouts, and innovative solutions for major global brands. I'm excited to be joining Trustly for its vision, its clear differentiators and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; its potential to completely revolutionise the way people pay for things in the United Kingdom. Watch this space.&rdquo;</p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges Data: Trading Value And Volumes Surge As Investors Flock To Markets</title>

<div> Trading, IPOs, Equity, Derivatives, Global Market<br />
Summary:
- Equity trading value and volumes increased in H1 2024
- Global equity market capitalization saw a 5% increase
- IPOs decreased globally by 24.2%
- Exchange-traded derivatives continued to grow
- Economic and geopolitical uncertainties may impact market growth.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>New data published by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and central clearing counterparties, shows that investor appetite for listed securities rose in the first half of 2024. Trading value increased 11.7%, and volumes rose 9.6%, as markets were highly liquid globally despite the backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainties. The volatility we have seen in markets in recent weeks shows this uncertainty has carried over to the second half of the year.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the six months to July 2024, global equity market capitalisation was up 5%, driven largely by the Americas, whilst the rapid growth in the APAC region reported at the end of 2023 slowed. EMEA&rsquo;s market capitalisation was flat.&nbsp;<br /><br />Compared to the previous half, IPOs fell 24.2%. The number of IPOs in the Americas rose by 36.4%, whilst both APAC and EMEA registered decreases, down -30.8% and -31.7% respectively. The number of listed companies is down marginally by 0.3% globally, though the number of listings in the Americas fell less than the same period the prior year. The EMEA region saw the sharpest decrease in number of listings, and APAC listings grew by 0.48%.&nbsp;<br /><br />Despite the overall decline in capital raised through IPOs, the average size of an IPO went up 18.8% compared to H2 2023. This was partially due to seven unicorn listings. The largest unicorn, Puig Brands, listed on SIX Group&rsquo;s BME Spanish Exchanges. SIX Group&rsquo;s Swiss Exchange also hosted the second largest unicorn, Galderma Group, a pharmaceutical company.<br /><br />Looking at other asset classes, exchange traded derivatives continued the growth trend over the last few years, rising 11.6%. There was a dramatic drop in currency options, down 38.2%, due to a regulatory change in India which requires ownership of the underlying asset before buying the derivative. The impact is marked because India was the largest market for currency options.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Key highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equity trading value&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>volumes&nbsp;</strong>increased 11.7% and 9.6% respectively compared to H2 2023, and 9.71% and 18.25% compared with H1 2023, witnessing the highest number of trades in a half-year in the last five years, including the peaks observed during the pandemic. The&nbsp;<strong>APAC&nbsp;</strong>region recorded its maximum number of trades in a half-year in the last five years (18.68 billion trades).</li>
<li>The volume of&nbsp;<strong>exchange-traded derivatives</strong>&nbsp;increased 11.6% compared to H2 2023 and 52.2% compared with H1 2023, amounting to 85.04 billion contracts.&nbsp;</li>
<li>While, compared with H2 2023,&nbsp;<strong>equity&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>interest rate derivatives</strong>&nbsp;volumes saw double digit increases (16.5% and 16.3%, respectively), their highest level in the last five years,&nbsp;<strong>currency&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>commodity&nbsp;</strong>derivatives recorded double digit declines (-38.2% and -15.4%, respectively).&nbsp;<strong>ETF derivatives</strong>&nbsp;increased only 6.8% in H1 2024.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Global equity market capitalisation</strong>&nbsp;increased 5% in H1 2024, compared to H2 2023, reaching USD 116.16 trillion, with over USD 5 trillion added to stock markets worldwide. While markets in the&nbsp;<strong>Americas&nbsp;</strong>region grew the most (+9.4%),&nbsp;<strong>APAC&nbsp;</strong>markets increased 1.4%, while&nbsp;<strong>EMEA&nbsp;</strong>markets were flat. When compared with H1 2023, there was an increase of 9.36% globally, mainly driven by the Americas region (15.82%).</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>number of IPOs</strong>&nbsp;decreased globally by 24.2% with respect to H2 2023 and by 8.7% with respect to H1 2023. While in the&nbsp;<strong>Americas&nbsp;</strong>region the number of IPOs rose by 36.4% with respect to H2 2023 and by 20% year on year, both&nbsp;<strong>APAC&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>EMEA</strong>&nbsp;registered decreases (-30.8% and -31.7% respectively, with respect to H2 2023 and -11.9% and -19.8% respectively, when compared to H1 2023). Global markets hosted 501 IPOs in H1 2024.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>capital raised through IPOs</strong>&nbsp;saw a 10% decline compared to H2 2023 and a 17% decline with respect to H1 2023, a result driven by the&nbsp;<strong>APAC</strong>&nbsp;region, which in H1 2024 recorded its minimum level in the last five years, while the&nbsp;<strong>Americas&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>EMEA&nbsp;</strong>regions experienced significant increases (97.1% and 121.4% respectively, compared to H2 2023; and 89.2% and 86% respectively, compared with H1 2023). Despite the decline, global markets hosted seven unicorns in the first half of this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;For the second half of the year a decline in inflationary pressures and an ease in monetary policy may support the positive trends we observed in H1 2024. The persistent geopolitical tensions, a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy coupled with the uncertainty derived from the U.S. election, could inhibit market growth. If that&rsquo;s the case, it will be hard on companies looking for capital, investors looking for attractive assets and savers looking to maximise their savings.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Investor demand for exchange-traded securities continued to grow, reflecting the fundamental stability of public markets in times of uncertainty. The data shows that investors are here and are looking for capital allocation opportunities. Exchanges call on governments and regulators to pull the necessary policy levers to encourage businesses to float and benefit from public finance. Without a strong pipeline of companies coming to market, the whole economy suffers.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=1898db5f19&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<div> SEC, OTC Link, SARs, AML policies, settlement<br />
Summary:<br />
OTC Link failed to file SARs for suspicious transactions, violating securities law. They agreed to a settlement of $1.19 million. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against OTC Link LLC, a New York-based broker-dealer, for failing to file numerous reports of suspicious financial transactions, known as Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), for a period of more than three years. OTC Link agreed to pay $1.19 million to settle the charges.</p>
<p>To help detect potential securities law and money-laundering violations, broker-dealers like OTC Link are required to file SARs describing suspicious transactions conducted through their firms. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, OTC Link&rsquo;s sole line of business is its operation of three alternative trading system (ATS) platforms, OTC Link ATS, OTC Link ECN, and OTC Link NQB. The three OTC Link ATSs are used by broker-dealers on a daily basis to execute or facilitate tens of thousands of transactions in over-the-counter (OTC) securities, many of which are considered microcap or penny stock securities.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, from March 2020 through May 2023, OTC Link failed to adopt or implement reasonably designed anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures to surveil transactions conducted through its ATSs for possible red flags of suspicious activity. As a result, OTC Link did not file a single SAR over this time period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broker-dealers are critical gatekeepers to the securities markets and must diligently monitor for suspicious transactions,&rdquo; said Tejal D. Shah, Associate Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office. &ldquo;When firms like OTC Link fail to file SARs, they deprive regulators and law enforcement of important information about suspicious activity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that OTC Link violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, OTC Link agreed to a censure and a cease-and-desist order in addition to the $1.19 million penalty. The SEC&rsquo;s order also directs OTC Link to continue its engagement of a compliance consultant to review and recommend changes to the firm&rsquo;s AML policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by William Conway and Sandeep Satwalekar under the supervision of Ms. Shah of the SEC&rsquo;s New York Regional Office, with assistance from the SEC&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act Review Group and Alexander Lefferts in the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investigative and Market Analytics. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Edward Janowsky, Hermann Vargas, and Steve Vitulano of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Examinations.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders Texas Company To Pay $100,000 For Failing To Register As An Introducing Broker</title>

<div> order, charges, Introducing Broker, civil monetary penalty, cease and desist<br />
Summary: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued charges and a civil monetary penalty against Cost Management Solutions, LLC for acting as an unregistered Introducing Broker. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Cost Management Solutions, LLC (CMS), a Texas corporation. The order finds the respondent failed to register as an Introducing Broker (IB) and requires CMS to pay a $100,000 civil monetary penalty. The CFTC also orders CMS to cease and desist from further violating the CEA, as charged.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order finds from at least May 2018 through the present, CMS acted as an unregistered IB by soliciting and accepting orders for swap and options transactions for its clients. CMS mainly brokered transactions in energy commodities, including propane, heating oil, and crude oil. CMS&rsquo;s IB activities included: identifying counterparties; price discovery; negotiating trades; and trade execution. CMS did not accept any money, securities, or property to margin, guarantee, or secure these transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;CMS received fees from its clients for its brokerage services.</p>
<p>CMS&rsquo; clients were primarily propane retailers interested in hedging risk. In a typical transaction, at its client&rsquo;s behest, CMS contacted two to three potential counterparties for a quote. CMS negotiated on behalf of its client with the counterparties. If the client determined the quote was acceptable, CMS then executed the swap agreement or option transaction on behalf of the client.</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Michael Amakor, Karen Kenmotsu, A. Daniel Ullman II, and Paul G. Hayeck.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify an individual or company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that individual or entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/Exit/index.htm?http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet" target="_blank">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint">file a tip or complaint online</a>, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>Addressing Investor Needs Through Application Of The Updated Conceptual Framework In FASB Standard Setting, Paul Munter, SEC Chief Accountant</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Conceptual Framework, FASB, standard-setting, financial reporting, accounting principles<br />
Summary: FASB has updated its Conceptual Framework to guide standard-setting activities, enhance financial reporting accuracy, and protect investors' interests. <div>
<p>Recently,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) completed a comprehensive update to its Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (&ldquo;Conceptual Framework&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Now that it has finalized this significant project, it is important that the Board actively consider the objectives and fundamentals in the updated Conceptual Framework throughout all of its standard-setting activities, to guide the Board in developing improved accounting principles to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of financial reporting and the protection of investors in the public interest.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Conceptual Framework is a body of interrelated objectives and fundamental concepts that provides guidance on the nature, function, elements, measurement approaches, and disclosure objectives of financial accounting and reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The FASB issued its first financial reporting concepts statement in 1978 and subsequently issued a total of seven concept statements through 2000. In 2014, in response to stakeholder feedback, the FASB decided to more comprehensively revisit its Conceptual Framework to provide a sound foundation for developing future accounting standards. The issuance of Chapter 6,&nbsp;<i>Measurement</i>, of Concepts Statement No. 8 on July 12, 2024, represents the culmination of that project by Board members and FASB staff.</p>
<p>Now that the updates to the Conceptual Framework are complete, it is important that the Board use it to guide its agenda-setting process and standard-setting deliberations, including to assist Board members in asking the right questions and objectively evaluating whether their views are consistent with the principles laid out in the Conceptual Framework.</p>
<p>In 1938, the Commission issued ASR No. 4, warning that &ldquo;financial statements . . . prepared in accordance with accounting principles for which there is no substantial authoritative support . . . will be presumed to be misleading or inaccurate despite disclosures . . . provided the matters involved are material.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;To interpret that message for today&rsquo;s environment: accounting is important, and disclosure is not a substitute for getting the accounting right on difficult or complex issues. The Conceptual Framework includes foundational concepts, including concepts on recognition and measurement of financial statement elements (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expense) and disclosures that are consistent with the words the Commission used in 1938 in ASR No. 4. Accordingly, a focus on application of the Conceptual Framework should improve the FASB&rsquo;s ability to set accounting and financial reporting standards that result in better financial information for the benefit of investors&mdash;that is, information that is relevant and that faithfully represents the economics of an issuer&rsquo;s commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>As the FASB embarks on its agenda consultation process later this year and considers its standard-setting agenda, application of the Conceptual Framework will be a critically important component of the Board&rsquo;s process. For example, the Conceptual Framework can assist the Board both in prioritizing potential projects to revise and improve accounting requirements and in determining:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether a potential project is consistent with the objectives of general purpose financial reporting;</li>
<li>How to scope a potential project, including whether a potential project should focus on disclosures-only or rather should address recognition and measurement of financial statement elements, in light of the Board&rsquo;s stated concept that &ldquo;disclosure of an amount . . . is not a substitution for recognition&rdquo;;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/munter-statement-fasb-081224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and</li>
<li>Whether the resulting financial reporting is expected to have the qualitative characteristics of useful financial information for users.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders may also benefit. Because the Conceptual Framework provides a common set of principles on which to base standard setting, public FASB deliberations on the application of the Conceptual Framework to each of the Board&rsquo;s standard-setting projects may help stakeholders better understand the basis of the Board&rsquo;s decisions. For example, using the Conceptual Framework as a starting point, the Board may be better able to articulate in the basis for conclusions of Accounting Standards Updates (&ldquo;ASU&rdquo;)&nbsp; whether and how amendments included in an ASU are consistent with the Conceptual Framework. Additionally, to the extent the Board deviates from the principles laid out in the Conceptual Framework, a discussion of the rationale for any such deviations may help stakeholders to better understand both the standard in question and its application. Likewise, stakeholder feedback to the Board on active projects may be more informative to the Board&rsquo;s deliberations when it is grounded in the principles of the Conceptual Framework.</p>
<p>The strength of our capital markets relies upon a commitment by all stakeholders, including standard setters, to quality in every aspect of financial reporting, to be able to provide investors with timely and accurate information. With the Conceptual Framework complete, the FASB&rsquo;s focus on the guiding principles described in the Conceptual Framework can help it continue to develop high-quality accounting standards coupled with robust disclosures to best serve the needs of investors and protect the public interest.</p>

<title>SEC Charges NovaTech And Its Principals And Promoters With $650 Million Crypto Fraud - Multi-Level Marketing Company Promoted Scheme To Defraud More Than 200,000 Investors Worldwide</title>

<div> fraudulent scheme, SEC charges, NovaTech, crypto assets, MLM <br />
Summary: SEC charges NovaTech and its operators for fraudulent scheme, luring investors with false promises, resulting in substantial losses. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Cynthia and Eddy Petion, along with their company, NovaTech Ltd., for operating a fraudulent scheme that raised more than $650 million in crypto assets from more than 200,000 investors worldwide, including many in the Haitian-American community. The SEC also charged Martin Zizi, Dapilinu Dunbar, James Corbett, Corrie Sampson, John Garofano, and Marsha Hadley for their roles in promoting NovaTech to investors.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Petions operated NovaTech as a multi-level marketing (MLM) and crypto asset investment program from 2019 through 2023. They lured investors by claiming NovaTech would invest their funds on crypto asset and foreign exchange markets. Cynthia Petion assured investors that their investments would be safe and promised that &ldquo;[i]n this program, you are in profit from day one, because again you have access to that capital.&rdquo; In reality, NovaTech used the majority of investor funds to make payments to existing investors and to pay commissions to promoters, using only a fraction of investor funds for trading. The complaint further alleges that the Petions siphoned millions of dollars of investor assets for themselves. When NovaTech ultimately collapsed, most investors were not able to withdraw their investments, resulting in substantial losses, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NovaTech and the Petions caused untold losses to tens of thousands of victims around the world,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office. &ldquo;As we allege, MLM schemes of this size require promoters to fuel them, and today&rsquo;s action demonstrates that we will hold accountable not just the principal architects of these massive schemes, but also promoters who spread their fraud by unlawfully soliciting victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that NovaTech&rsquo;s top promoters, Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, Sampson, Garofano, and Hadley, each recruited a wide network of investors and promoters. NovaTech paid them substantial commissions for the investors they and their networks recruited. When Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson became aware of certain red flags about NovaTech, including regulatory actions taken against it by U.S. and Canadian regulators, they continued recruiting investors and downplayed the red flags.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charges NovaTech, the Petions, Zizi, Dunbar, Corbett, and Sampson with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and all of the defendants with registration violations. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Zizi agreed to partially settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by consenting to a $100,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions, with the amount of other monetary remedies to be determined at a later date. The partial settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Catherine Rowsey, Todd Baker, and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Sejal Bhakta of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Nikolay Vydashenko and B. David Fraser. The litigation is being conducted by Patrick Disbennett and supervised by Keefe Bernstein. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Office of the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s Investor Protection Bureau, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the British Columbia Securities Commission, and the Ontario Securities Commission.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Retail Strategy Task Force has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-alert-watch-out-fraudulent-digital-asset-and-crypto-trading-websites">Investor Alert on Fraudulent Digital Asset and &ldquo;Crypto&rdquo; Trading Websites</a>, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/resources-investors/investor-alerts-bulletins/affinity-fraud">Investor Alert: Affinity Fraud</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/crypto-scams">an Investor Alert on Crypto-Scams</a>, and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts-ia_pyramidhtm.html">Investor Alert on Pyramid Schemes Posing as Multi-Level Marketing Programs</a>.

<title>B.C.-Based Crypto Trading Platform Defrauded Customers Of $13 Million</title>

<div> Fraud, Crypto trading platform, BCSC, Cold storage, Gambling<br />
Summary:<br />
BCSC panel found that ezBtc committed fraud by diverting $13 million of customer assets to gambling, led to actual loss. Sanctions pending. <div>
<p>A B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Decisions/2024/2024-BCSECCOM-348.pdf" target="_blank">has found</a>&nbsp;that a B.C.-based crypto trading platform committed fraud by lying to its customers and diverting about $13 million of their assets to gambling.</p>
<p>The platform, which operated under the name ezBtc and was incorporated by then-B.C. resident David Smillie, allowed customers to buy and sell various crypto assets.&nbsp;ezBtc and Smillie told customers that their crypto assets would be held in &ldquo;cold storage,&rdquo; a more secure method of keeping digital assets offline to protect them from cyber threats and unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Instead, the BCSC panel found that approximately a third of all the crypto assets that customers deposited with ezBtc or acquired on the ezBtc platform between 2016 and 2019 were diverted to gambling sites or to Smillie&rsquo;s personal accounts on other crypto trading platforms.</p>
<p>As the panel notes, &ldquo;customers were unable to recover all of their assets. The deceit led to actual loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BCSC hired a forensic data analytics firm to determine what happened to the 2,300 bitcoins and over 600 ethers that were supposedly kept in ezBtc&rsquo;s custody in cold storage. The analytics firm determined that 935.46 bitcoins and 159 ethers were &ldquo;quickly transferred&rdquo; to either Smillie&rsquo;s personal accounts or two gambling websites. In one instance, a customer deposited a certain amount of bitcoin on ezBtc and just 14 minutes later, ezBtc transferred that exact same amount of bitcoin to one of the gambling sites.</p>
<p>The panel found that Smillie directed the affairs of ezBtc and likely directed the transfers of customer assets. Not only was Smillie aware that ezBtc did not keep custody of all of its customers&rsquo; assets, but he should have been aware that diverting customer assets could result in serious financial consequences for those customers, the panel said. By authorizing, permitting or acquiescing in ezBtc&rsquo;s misconduct, Smillie committed the same misconduct as the platform.</p>
<p>Smillie did not attend the hearing, although he was represented by a lawyer. The company, which was dissolved in 2022, did not participate in the proceedings.</p>
<p>The panel will next consider what sanctions to impose, which could include monetary sanctions and bans from market participation.</p>
<p>A list of crypto trading platforms authorized to do business with Canadians is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;of the Canadian Securities Administrators, of which the BCSC is a member.</p>

<title>FESE Response To The ESMA Call For Evidence On The Review Of The UCITS Eligible Assets Directive</title>

<div> flexible approach, UCITS Eligible Assets Directive, market liquidity, banking, clearing

Summary:
FESE welcomes call for evidence to review UCITS Eligible Assets Directive for a more flexible approach, suggests adjustments for investments, and recommends amendments for clearing efficiencies. <div>
<p>FESE welcomes the call for evidence and considers that a more flexible approach in the UCITS Eligible Assets Directive could promote market liquidity and the attractiveness of EU markets. For example, the &ldquo;5/10/40 Rule&rdquo; for investments in transferable securities and money market instruments can be detrimental to issuers and investors and we suggest a review and potential adjustment of this rule to a more flexible &ldquo;20/40 Rule&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We also believe that there are inconsistencies between banking, clearing, and EU funds regulation, which disincentivise buy-side entities from using central clearing for securities financing transactions. Therefore, we recommend targeted amendments to the UCITS and MMF frameworks to facilitate more voluntary clearing and efficiencies for the buy-side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced it has begun publishing intraday values for the new Cboe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Volatility Basis Point Index ("VIXTLT Index"). Leveraging Cboe's proprietary VIX&reg; Index methodology, the VIXTLT Index provides market participants with the ability to track future (30-day) expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market in real-time.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The VIXTLT Index is designed to be a U.S. Treasury market volatility measure comparable to the Cboe Volatility Index&reg; (VIX&reg;), which measures 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. equity market and is considered by many to be the world's premier barometer of U.S. equity market volatility. By monitoring the VIXTLT and VIX indices together, investors may be offered insight into how expected volatility of two of the most important asset classes react to each other during different volatility regimes.</p>
<p>The VIXTLT Index is calculated using listed options on the iShares&reg; 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), a highly liquid exchange-traded fund (ETF) composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities exceeding twenty years that have a relatively high duration.</p>
<p>"The launch of the VIXTLT Index is another milestone in Cboe's offering of timely and transparent forward-looking volatility measures. Market participants have long sought a VIX-like gauge for U.S. Treasury volatility, and with the US election and the Federal Reserve's expected monetary policy shift looming, interest in this asset class remains high," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "With both the VIXTLT and the VIX indices utilizing similar methodologies, investors will be able to gain a more like-to-like view of expected volatility in the bond and equity markets, potentially enabling them to make more informed decisions."</p>
<p>Demand for a real-time measure of U.S. Treasury market volatility has heightened over the past few years amid periods of bond market volatility and high inflation. To meet customer demand, VIXTLT is available in basis point volatility terms and aims to provide an absolute measure of volatility, a key concept in fixed income markets where risk is commonly perceived as the absolute change and not percentage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VIXTLT Index was developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4230930-1&amp;h=1085635274&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Flabs%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Labs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Labs</a>, the company's product innovation hub, with the administrator being&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4230930-1&amp;h=1640078149&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Findices%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Global+Indices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Global Indices</a>. The index is the latest addition to Cboe's growing volatility index suite, which recently welcomed the launch of four new Credit Volatility Indices (Credit VIX), and expands Cboe's offering of more than&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4230930-1&amp;h=3620685633&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4192417-1%26h%3D4061598917%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.cboe.com%252Fus%252Findices%252Findicesproducts%252F%26a%3D450%2Bderivatives-based%2Bindices&amp;a=450+derivatives-based+indices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">450 derivatives-based indices</a>. Notably in the fixed income space, Cboe Global Indices' Cboe TLT 2% OTM BuyWrite Index is the benchmark index for the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF (TLTW).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the summer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spink.com/site/index" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spink &amp; Sons<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;held four auctions (&pound;5, &pound;10, &pound;20 and &pound;50) with our Chief Cashier and Executive Director of Banking, Sarah John, opening the bidding on the first lot for the &pound;5 auction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The auctions raised &pound;914,127 for ten charities. These include the Bank&rsquo;s three current &lsquo;charities of the year&rsquo; as well as an additional seven previous charities of the year that did not benefit from the proceeds of a charity polymer banknote auction held since 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current three&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/corporate-responsibility/charities-of-the-year">charities of the year</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.childhoodtrust.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Childhood Trust<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/spring-appeal-ppc/?https://www.trusselltrust.org/be-here-ppc/&amp;gad_source=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Trussell Trust<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://giveusashout.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shout<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;(powered by the charity Mental Health Innovations). The other charities to benefit from this auction and the ballot are:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carersuk.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6aza46WuhwMV8ZhQBh2HjgbYEAAYASAAEgIfS_D_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carers UK<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.demelza.org.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrcuW_-qghgMVtToGAB17qwuQEAAYASAAEgI7mfD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Demelza<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WWF-UK<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Brain Tumour Charity<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.londonsairambulance.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London&rsquo;s Air Ambulance Charity<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.childbereavementuk.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjsC5r6auhwMVHqiDBx1RYg-2EAAYASAAEgL84fD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Child Bereavement UK<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samaritans.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Samaritans<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The auction broke the record for the highest lot sold in a Bank of England banknote auction with a &pound;50 sheet going for &pound;26,000. This was followed by the &pound;10 auction where a single note was sold for &pound;17,000 with the serial number HB01 00002.</p>
<p>Sarah John, Chief Cashier and Executive Director of Banking said: I am thrilled that the auctions and public ballot of low numbered King Charles III banknotes have raised a remarkable &pound;914,127 that will be donated to ten charities chosen by Bank of England staff. Each charity does incredible work and the monies raised will have a positive impact on people across the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each charity received over &pound;91,400 from the proceeds of the auction and ballot. This money could support initiatives such as the equivalent of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Childhood Trust could alleviate the impact of poverty for 2,600 disadvantaged children living in London, enhancing their physical and mental well-being, safety, and confidence to prepare them for life and ensure a better future.</li>
<li>Shout enabling their volunteers to take 9,140 potentially life-saving conversations with anyone in the UK in need of urgent support with their mental health.</li>
<li>The Trussell Trust supporting food banks in their network to provide emergency food parcels to over 7,600 people who can&rsquo;t afford to eat, keep warm and pay the bills.</li>
<li>Carers UK could enable Helpline Advisors to respond to over 10,447 enquiries from unpaid carers in need of support (based on an annual average of 35,000 enquiries).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Demelza could pay for two specialist nurses for a year which would provide expert clinical care for children and families wherever is best for them; in a Demelza hospice or in their homes, online, at school or in local communities.</li>
<li>WWF-UK could use this donation to protect and restore our amazing UK nature. WWF is restoring our seas by expanding seagrass meadows to help combat climate change and returning oysters to the Firth of Forth to create thriving marine habitats. On land, WWF is working with partners to restore rare chalk streams, reconnect wetlands that support native species whilst reducing flooding, and collaborating with farmers to help nature thrive.</li>
<li>The Brain Tumour Charity could fund 17 months of pioneering research on one of their Future Leaders projects to find new treatments, improve understanding, increase survival, and bring them closer to a cure. Similar funding research enabled them to announce a breakthrough in paediatric treatments in April this year and have a new medicine available on the NHS.</li>
<li>London's Air Ambulance Charity could fund 41 missions, delivering an advanced trauma team to London&rsquo;s most seriously injured patients. When there is no time to reach a hospital, their medics deliver life-saving interventions at the scene, with an average flight time of just 7.5 minutes.</li>
<li>Child Bereavement UK could fund their entire Support &amp; Information service, including their freephone Helpline, for three months, providing lifelines for families seeking support after the death of someone important to them.</li>
<li>Samaritans: help cover the cost of training 450 new volunteers to build the skills they need to answer a call to someone in emotional distress.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The King Charles banknotes mark the first time the Bank of England has changed a monarch on our banknotes. Her late Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first monarch on our banknotes, beginning with our Series C &pound;1 banknotes in 1960.</p>
<p>The King Charles banknotes are a continuation of the current series, and, as such, the serial numbers commence from the next available cypher following those previously used for the production of notes featuring Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<title>The EBA Responds To The European Commission’s Delegated Act Postponing The Application Of The Market Risk Framework In The EU</title>

<div> Delegated Act, FRTB, European Commission, EBA, market risk framework
Summary: EBA issues no-action letter on FRTB postponement, recommends no enforcement, and shares technical considerations. Concerns over two-step implementation and global regulatory fragmentation. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>Following the European Commission&rsquo;s adoption of a Delegated Act postponing the application of the revised market risk framework in the EU, the so-called Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), the European Banking Authority (EBA) today publishes a no-action letter on the boundary between the banking book and the trading book and shares its considerations on technical questions and issues arising from the postponement.</span></p>
<p>In its no-action letter, the EBA recommends that competent authorities should not prioritise any supervisory or enforcement action in relation to the amendments to the provisions setting the boundary between the banking and trading books, or those defining internal risk transfers between books. In that context, the EBA also clarifies that the points it made in another&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-no-action-letter-boundary-between-banking-book">no-action letter on the same topic issued in 2023</a>&nbsp;should remain applicable.</p>
<p>The EBA is of the opinion that the front-loaded application of the revised provisions on the boundary and internal risk transfers, compared to the rest of the FRTB framework, which is not yet implemented in the Union for capital purposes, would subject institutions to an operationally complex, fragmented and costly two-step implementation. In addition, there are no jurisdictions at the global level that envisage such a two-step implementation of the FRTB framework. This means that a front-loaded application of the boundary provisions would lead to global institutions being subject to very different regulatory requirements depending on where the risk management is performed, thus resulting in a fragmentation of the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The EBA also shares some considerations on a set of technical questions and implementation issues arising from the postponement, that were deemed material and relevant with a view to achieving a harmonised implementation of the market risk framework across institutions during the postponement period. The EBA also provides clarity on the supervisory benchmarking exercise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The no-action letter is based on Article 9c of&nbsp;<a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2010/1093/2021-06-26">Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010</a>&nbsp;(EBA Founding Regulation). That article provides that the EBA may issue no-action letters, if it considers that the application of one of the relevant legislative acts is liable to raise significant issues, as provisions contained in such act may directly conflict with another relevant act, and if it considers on the basis of the information available that the application of the relevant provisions raises significant exceptional issues pertaining to market confidence and the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets.</p>
<p>On 24 July 2024, the European Commission adopted&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/banking-prudential-requirements-regulation_en">a Delegated Act</a>&nbsp;in accordance with Article 461a of Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR3&rsquo;), which postpones the use of the alternative approaches for the calculation of the own funds requirements for market risk by a year to 1 January 2026. The publication of that Delegated Act by the European Commission was accompanied by a set of&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/news/banking-package-questions-and-answers-2024-07-24_en">question and answers on some aspects of the postponement</a>, including the application of the revised boundary between the banking and trading books, and the use of the alternative standardised approach in the context of the output floor calculations.</p>

<br />
Founder of Aquis Exchange, Alasdair Haynes, anticipates a wave of international investment in the UK due to a stable government, aiming to invigorate retail investing and UK markets. <br /><br />Summary: Aquis Exchange CEO, Alasdair Haynes, expects a surge of international investment in the UK market with a stable government and aims to promote retail investing. <div>
<p>Alasdair Haynes, founder and CEO of Aquis Exchange, anticipates a &ldquo;tidal wave of international investment&rdquo; to come to the UK following the July general election which saw the Labour Party form a new government.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/e/qn0q3518-">eToro&rsquo;s Digest &amp; Invest podcast</a> this week, Haynes discussed his optimistic outlook for the UK market for the next five to ten years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Alasdair Haynes said: </b><i>"At this point in time, I'm extremely bullish about what's going to happen in the UK and what's going to happen in Europe. The UK in particular, I think, has been a very, very cheap market and it hasn't been invested in because it hasn't had a stable government for a number of years.</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Regardless of how you voted in the last general election, now it looks like we actually have a stable government with a significant majority. I think that is going to open the doors for literally a tidal wave of international investment to be able to come into the UK. The capital will arrive not only domestically, which it has been in the past few years, but actually internationally and particularly from the United States.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>During the interview, Haynes also discussed the need to invigorate retail investing and an interest in markets in the UK. He added: &ldquo;<i>We need to get the public back into public markets&hellip; The appetite and interest in equity [in the US] is huge, and we don't have that here.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;[Aquis Exchange] is about bringing competition into our industry to change UK capital markets. It's through that that we can start to get scale-up capital to vitally important businesses to change the economy in the UK.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.etoro.com/digest-and-invest/">Digest &amp; Invest</a> podcast offers listeners financial news and market insights in a fun and digestible format. You can listen to the interview with Alasdair Haynes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKgcXc-otUU">here</a>.</p>

<div> Culture, M&amp;A, Liquidity, Supervision, Regulation
<br />
The article discusses the state of the economy, monetary policy, banking regulation, and supervision, highlighting challenges and areas for improvement.
<br /><br />Summary: The article discusses the current state of the economy, challenges in banking regulation, and the need for thoughtful and deliberate regulatory reforms. <div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you again this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Just as banking and economic conditions continue to evolve, so too do bank regulatory and supervisory standards. I look forward to learning your perspectives on the evolving banking and economic conditions, and the banking agencies' approaches to regulation and supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Economic and Monetary Policy Outlook</strong><br />Before discussing my thoughts on bank regulatory matters, and in light of our recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I will begin by sharing my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our July meeting, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>After seeing considerable progress last year, we have seen some further progress on lowering inflation in recent months. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, which I prefer relative to more volatile higher-frequency readings, have moved down since April, although they have remained somewhat elevated and stood at 2.5 percent and 2.6 percent in June, respectively. The progress in lowering inflation during May and June is a welcome development, but inflation is still uncomfortably above the Committee's 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Despite the recent good data reports, core PCE inflation averaged an annualized 3.4 percent over the first half of the year. And given that supply constraints have now largely normalized, I am not confident that inflation will decline in the same way as in the second half of last year. More importantly, prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest, since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation over the past few years.</p>
<p>Economic activity moderated in the first half of this year after increasing at a strong pace last year. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth moved up in the second quarter, following a soft reading in the first quarter, while private domestic final purchases (PDFP) increased at a solid pace in both quarters. During the first half of 2024, PDFP slowed much less than GDP, as the slowdown in GDP growth was partly driven by volatile categories such as net exports, suggesting that underlying economic growth was stronger than GDP indicated. Unusually strong consumer goods spending last year softened in the first quarter of this year, largely accounting for the step-down in PDFP growth.</p>
<p>Although consumer spending strengthened in the second quarter, consumers appear to be pulling back on discretionary items and expenses, as evidenced in part by a decline in restaurant spending since late last year. Low- and moderate-income consumers no longer have savings to support this type of spending, and we've seen a normalization of loan delinquency rates as they have risen from historically low levels during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The labor market continues to loosen, as the number of available workers has increased and the number of available jobs has declined&mdash;showing signs that the labor market is coming into better balance. After slowing in the second quarter, payroll employment gains eased to a more modest pace in July, even as job openings are being filled by the increased immigrant labor supply. The latest labor market report shows that the unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in July. Although notably higher than a year ago, this is still a historically low unemployment rate. In addition, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has declined to its pre-pandemic level. We are also seeing a slowing in wage growth, which now stands at just under 4 percent as measured by the employment cost index. However, given trend productivity, wage gains are still above the pace consistent with our inflation goal.</p>
<p>My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment. But we need to be patient and avoid undermining continued progress on lowering inflation by overreacting to any single data point. Instead, we must view the data in their totality as the risks to the Committee's employment and price-stability mandates continue to move into better balance. That said, I still see some upside risks to inflation.</p>
<p>First, as I noted earlier, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due both to increased labor force participation and strong immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and significantly higher U.S. immigration over the past few years may decrease going forward.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, as the recent surge in container shipping costs originating in Asia suggest that global supply chains remain susceptible to disruptions, which could put upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, impeding further progress on reducing inflation.</p>
<p>Finally, there continues to be a risk that the increased immigration could lead to persistently high housing services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize.</p>
<p>There are also risks that the labor market has not been as strong as the payroll data have been indicating, but it also appears that the recent rise in unemployment may be exaggerating the degree of cooling in labor markets. The Q4 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report implies that job gains have been consistently overstated in the establishment survey since March of last year, while the household survey unemployment data have become less accurate as response rates have appreciably declined since the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Moreover, the rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job searchers entering the labor force are taking longer to find a job, while layoffs remain low. It is also likely that some temporary factors contributed to the soft July employment report. The rise in the unemployment rate in July was centered in workers experiencing a temporary layoff, who are more likely to be rehired in coming months, and Hurricane Beryl likely contributed to weaker job gains, as the number of workers not working due to bad weather increased significantly last month.</p>
<p>In light of upside risks to inflation and uncertainty regarding labor market conditions and the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. Increased measurement challenges and the frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how it will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering adjustments to the current stance of policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when assessing how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, with a focus on the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. By the time of our September meeting, we will have seen a range of additional economic data and information, including one employment and two inflation reports. We will also have a wider view of how developments in broader financial conditions might influence the economic outlook. In particular, equity prices have been volatile recently but are still higher than at the end of last year.</p>
<p>I will continue to closely monitor the data and visit with a broad range of contacts as I assess economic conditions and the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. As I noted earlier, I continue to view inflation as somewhat elevated. And with some upside risks to inflation, I still see the need to pay close attention to the price-stability side of our mandate while watching for risks of a material weakening in the labor market. My view continues to be that restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Banking Regulation and Supervision</strong><br />I will turn now to bank regulation and supervision. Today I would like to address a few topics that I expect will be of interest to those in this room, starting with the issue of culture both within banks and at bank and other financial regulatory agencies. I will then briefly discuss mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity in the banking industry, and the current and expected outlook for bank transactions. I will close with a discussion on bank liquidity regulation.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Culture at Banks and at Regulators</strong><br />In recent years, regulatory approaches have included regulators seeking to influence the culture within banks, specifically large banks, focusing on matters like building a culture that promotes compliance or effective risk management, including operational risk. A bank's culture drives its sense of ownership and a collective purpose that is common among many successful organizations, where a bank's board, management, and employees all work together in support of the bank's business purpose and mission. Bank culture can have a strong influence on both business outcomes and on compliance and risk-management outcomes.</p>
<p>Bank culture starts with bank leadership, the so-called tone from the top. Strong bank culture demands accountability for bank leadership teams and for the entire workforce. A bank's management is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the company, including which business lines to pursue, expand, or eliminate. But bank leaders also have a responsibility to empower employees to raise issues and concerns, allowing them to identify and escalate emerging business, risk-management, or compliance matters that may require management's attention or intervention. While regulators have sought to influence bank culture over time, ultimately culture is most heavily influenced and shaped by the example set by bank leaders and by the actions of each bank employee.</p>
<p>Regulatory agency culture can be similarly impactful in shaping bank regulation and supervision to promote safety and soundness and consumer compliance in an effective and efficient manner. In contrast to regulators, bank management may choose to modify or reshape their mission and objectives over time&mdash;evolving their business goals, risk-management policies and processes, and compliance standards as conditions change. For regulators, the overarching regulatory and supervisory mission and related institutional goals are prescribed by statute. While bank regulators lack the flexibility to change the mission, they have significant flexibility in the execution of that mission. This often involves broad policy goals&mdash;for example, promoting the safety and soundness of the banking system, and the stability of the financial system.</p>
<p>Similar to bank culture, regulatory agency culture begins with its leadership and is then carried out by the individual members of the organization's workforce. Culture plays a significant role in how well bank regulators pursue their statutory objectives and the manner in which they perform the related mission. Have regulators created a culture that allows the staff to identify and escalate issues of concern? Have regulators oriented the mission of the institution around core statutory goals and avoided the temptation to stray from this mission into other matters of public policy? Have regulators created a culture of accountability for leaders and employees, where shortcomings can be fairly identified and actions can be taken to remediate problems?</p>
<p>While the value of culture is widely acknowledged, both among banks and among bank regulators, we have seen some recent high-profile examples of culture falling short, and with serious consequences.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Responsible banking involves not only finding and pursuing opportunities to serve customers and grow the business, but also balancing these business priorities with a firm commitment to risk management and compliance, including consumer compliance. While banks are free to pursue growth, in some instances this growth has come without accompanying development of and investment in risk management and legal compliance, to the detriment of the bank and its customers.</p>
<p>In the case of Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) failure in 2023, rapid growth was certainly a factor that contributed to the firm's fragility. The bank's management failed to properly manage its development of contingent liquidity planning, funding, and risk-management capabilities in light of its rapid growth. While this failure revealed problems with bank leadership in promoting a compliance and risk-management culture commensurate with growth, supervisors directly overseeing the bank's expansion were also late to act in the face of emerging firm risks.</p>
<p>I think we should question whether we have learned all of the right lessons from SVB's failure. We know that rapid growth is a known risk factor that should result in&nbsp;<em>additional</em>&nbsp;supervisory scrutiny. But some of the post-failure SVB reviews conducted internally by Federal Reserve staff cited rapid growth as a contributing factor for the inadequacy of the supervisory approach.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Among other things, these internal reports suggested that the shift of SVB from one supervisory portfolio to another somehow frustrated appropriate supervision. We need to ask whether supervisors are empowered to appropriately supervise firms that experience rapid growth and other emerging risks.</p>
<p>Each regulatory agency has an obligation to facilitate an environment that can help the agency best fulfill its mission. It must take care to maintain a positive and productive culture over time by listening intently to concerns that are raised, ensuring that employees are empowered to raise issues of concern (including reporting of personnel issues), and taking appropriate actions to remediate those concerns. Regulators are certainly not immune from problems arising with institutional culture.</p>
<p>Recently, we have seen a high-profile example of problems with the culture at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). I commend the FDIC for engaging an independent third party to assist them in their investigation; this is an important first step toward accountability and addressing these issues.</p>
<p>We must not lose sight of the lesson that cultural problems at both banks and regulators can compound cyclical downturns in the banking environment and pose more serious risks to the banking system. Cultivating a positive culture, one that values accountability and the contributions of both management and staff to an organization's mission, can serve as a buffer against future stresses.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</strong><br />Another area of ongoing interest among regulators is the approach to banking industry M&amp;A transactions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;The significant shift in regulatory approaches is concerning. As a threshold matter, any discussion of regulatory approval standards should begin with an understanding of the critical role bank M&amp;A transactions play in a healthy banking system.</p>
<p>M&amp;A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote their long-term health and viability. M&amp;A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&amp;A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities, and leaving zombie banks that have no competitive viability or exit strategy to continue operations.</p>
<p>The impact of a more restrictive M&amp;A framework affects institutions of all sizes, including larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Banks of all sizes may choose to pursue M&amp;A to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to remain competitive with larger peers that can achieve growth organically through sheer scale. The consequence of limiting the growth options for any bank hoping to compete with the largest G-SIBs has the perverse, and unintended, consequence of actually further insulating the very largest institutions from competition.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, and while recognizing the value of M&amp;A to the banking system, regulators must be pragmatic and thoughtful about reforms. As first steps, we must define the desired end state we are seeking to achieve with any changes. We must then identify the problem that needs to be solved and proffer a solution that is fair, transparent, consistent with applicable statutes, tailored for each bank category, and efficient. We should not propose a cure without first identifying an ailment and a reasoned basis for the prescribed outcome.</p>
<p>The primary argument raised by proponents of reform is that the regulatory approval process has become a rubber stamp, one in which regulators do not conduct a meaningful review against the statutory factors laid out by Congress. Bankers who have been through the M&amp;A approval process would almost certainly disagree with the notion that regulators take a light-touch approach in reviewing banking transactions.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence to undermine this argument. Let's consider just the process of filing an application. It begins with identifying an M&amp;A target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. The next steps are preparing and filing the application, and engaging with regulators throughout the review process and beyond approval, in anticipation of post-approval business processes, including systems conversions and customer transitions.</p>
<p>The costs of M&amp;A can be substantial, and banks do not enter into transactions without significant preparation and planning, including an informed analysis that any proposal would be likely to result in regulatory approval. The demands of the process act as a self-selection mechanism, with only institutions that see both value in the transaction&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>a strong likelihood of regulatory approval going through the process. This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve data support the view that even for the self-selected population who files an application, the process does not always lead to approval. To the contrary, based on the most recent data reported for 2023, a significant portion of M&amp;A applications were withdrawn before approval, and the average processing time in the second half of 2023 was 87 days.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The number of approved M&amp;A transactions was also significantly lower in 2023 than it was in 2020, 2021, or 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>When we talk about M&amp;A process reform, it can feel like bankers and regulators are living in different worlds. Bankers seek to conclude the process in a timely way, enabling them to move forward from the uncertainty of the application process to the important work of integrating the banks' operations as quickly as possible. One of the key risks to an effective process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty. In contrast, some regulators feel pressure to revisit well-established regulatory approval standards relating to statutory factors, such as the effect of a transaction on competition, or to even expand the use of M&amp;A review to accomplish other objectives, like forcing banks to adopt regulatory standards that would not otherwise apply by regulation as a condition of approval.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Regulatory reforms should promote a healthy banking system and must acknowledge the important role M&amp;A activity plays in keeping the system healthy. Unfortunately, reform efforts, and the existing record of performance on banking M&amp;A transactions, show a concerning trend that the barriers to bank M&amp;A activity remain substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong><br />Since last spring, regulators have also focused on revisiting bank liquidity requirements. Last month, the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Atlanta hosted a research conference to discuss the Federal Reserve's traditional role as a "lender of last resort," the payments infrastructure, deposit insurance reform, and the sources of bank liquidity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The discussions included a broad range of views on all of these topics, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of all of the issues before moving forward with any proposals for solutions.</p>
<p>The failures of SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank have prompted discussion among policymakers about the need for even more regulation. It's important to emphasize here that the conditions for failure, and the subsequent banking stress, could not have occurred without bank management and supervisory failures. Therefore, identifying and remediating these known and identifiable issues to the greatest extent possible should continue to be a priority as we engage in serious discussions about regulatory reforms.</p>
<p>Those events also highlighted the need to revisit bank liquidity and funding as part of our review of the regulatory framework. When we consider the Federal Reserve's operational infrastructure, including Fedwire&reg; and discount window lending, we must ask if the Federal Reserve's tools were effective and complementary to other funding sources (including Federal Home Loan Bank funding) during times of stress, and if not, we must ask how they could be improved. Reform discussions should include not only thinking about new and revised requirements and expectations that would apply to individual banks, but also identifying opportunities to remediate deficiencies and overlapping requirements within the regulatory framework.</p>
<p><em>Lender of Last Resort and Payments Infrastructure</em></p>
<p>One area in need of attention is considering how to operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to meet banking system liquidity needs more effectively. The payments infrastructure that supports bank funding mechanisms must be prepared to operate effectively both during business-as-usual conditions and during stress events. Yet during the banking stress in 2023 and the unprecedented speed of the bank runs that occurred, some banks experienced frictions in using the discount window and limits on the availability of payment services. These issues may have interfered with liquidity management activity and exacerbated the banking stress.</p>
<p>The Fed must continue to enhance the technology, operational readiness, and services underpinning discount window loans and payment services to ensure that they are available when needed. On this front, I would note that the Federal Reserve recently published a proposal to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service, to operate 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, on a year-round basis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The proposal also requested feedback on whether the discount window should operate during these same expanded hours. Expanded service hours are a concrete example of a change that is responsive to the issues experienced last spring, but my hope is that these changes are accompanied by other important operational improvements, including improved technology and operational readiness within the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p><em>Bank Liquidity</em></p>
<p>Bank liquidity has also been a prominent feature in reform discussions, focusing on whether the calibration and scope of the regulatory framework is appropriate. This includes the discussion of possible revisions to liquidity-related regulatory requirements, including liquidity stress testing and the liquidity coverage ratio, as well as shifting supervisory expectations for contingent funding plans and the availability of alternative liquidity sources.</p>
<p>As we consider the requirements and expectations for banks, we should also consider the availability of funding and liquidity sources and mechanisms&mdash;for example, the role of repo (repurchase agreement) markets and the standing repo facility, extension of credit from the Federal Home Loan Banks, and, of course, the role of the Fed's discount window. While the Federal Reserve considers reforms specifically to the discount window, it is important to frame these discussions within a broader context of other sources, and in light of the unique position of the discount window in this framework. The discount window is a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It is intended to be a source of liquidity as a last resort and at a penalty rate, not as a primary funding resource in the normal course of business at a market rate. In evaluating the bank liquidity framework, it is imperative that we consider and understand the interrelationships among these resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and bank liquidity planning.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240810a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Some policymakers have stated that a potential response to the 2023 banking stress would be to require banks to preposition collateral at the Fed's discount window, and while policymakers have discussed potential&nbsp;<em>regulatory&nbsp;</em>reforms to implement this change,&nbsp;<em>supervisory&nbsp;</em>communications have already begun directing collateral prepositioning as a supervisory best practice. As a policy reform, the notion is that forcing banks to preposition collateral in this way will create a ready pool of liquidity those banks can draw from during times of stress. This compulsory requirement to preposition collateral, it is argued, could also mitigate some of the stigma associated with using the discount window and thereby improve its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a prepositioning requirement as a solution to perceived stigma concerns remains to be seen, but one can reasonably question if compulsory prepositioning or compulsory use of the discount window would materially change market perceptions and resolve bank concerns about stigma. There is no reason for a bank to take a loan at a penalty rate or to preposition collateral during periods of calm if the discount window operates effectively and communicates with banks on a regular basis. If the issue is that the window does not operate in an effective manner, requirements to use it more frequently will not address these underlying operational issues. To the contrary, investments must be made to address its operational shortcomings.</p>
<p>Some reforms, like encouraging bank readiness to borrow from the discount window if that is part of banks' contingency funding plans, could be explored more thoroughly. If a bank includes the discount window in these plans and intends to use it during stress, the bank should be prepared to do so. But if we are honest, we must recognize that our prior efforts to reduce discount window stigma, as during the COVID period, have not been durable or successful, and that perhaps resources would be better devoted to making sure the discount window is prepared to act in a timely way, rather than adding even more regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations to banks that may complicate day-to-day liquidity management, with uncertain liquidity benefits during stress.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next steps in liquidity reform, it is imperative that we tackle known and identified issues that were exposed during the banking stress last year. This must include updating discount window operations and technology and making sure that payment services are available when needed. But for other reforms, a number of important questions remain unanswered, including understanding both where there are frictions and weaknesses in the current bank funding landscape, and what the potential impact (including intended and unintended consequences) of these reforms on the banking industry could be. In my view, remediation of known issues must remain a key priority.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />The federal banking agencies' reform agenda has recently been directed toward rapid and transformational change, rather than deliberate and incremental change. Just as a bank's rapid growth may increase the risks of outgrowing risk-management and compliance frameworks, rapid regulatory reforms increase the risk of regulation resulting in harmful unintended consequences to the banking and financial system. Banks are already experiencing the effects of this "rapid change" approach through the supervisory process. And it will become increasingly clear as the reform agenda continues on its current path.</p>
<p>Bankers should be concerned about significant swings of the regulatory pendulum, swings that increase financial system uncertainty and instability and that complicate day-to-day operations and long-term planning. Deliberate, thoughtful change allows the Federal Reserve to demonstrate that it executes its duties in an independent manner, focusing on its statutory obligations, and helps build public support and trust.</p>
<p>I look forward to our conversation.</p>

<div> Fraud, Securities and Exchange Commission, Ideanomics, CEO, Financial Performance
Summary:<br /><br />The Securities and Exchange Commission settled fraud charges against Ideanomics and its executives for misleading the public about the company's financial performance.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled fraud charges against Ideanomics, Inc., formerly known as Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc., and its former Chairman and CEO, Zheng (Bruno) Wu, for misleading the public about the company&rsquo;s financial performance between 2017 and 2019. The SEC also announced settled charges against Ideanomics&rsquo; current CEO, Alfred Poor, and former CFO, Federico Tovar, for their roles in the scheme.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s orders allege that, in mid-November 2017, Ideanomics and Wu reported 2017 revenue guidance of $300 million, despite numerous known issues indicating that the company would miss this guidance by a wide margin. The company later reported only $144 million in 2017 revenues. Ideanomics and Wu also misled the company&rsquo;s auditor with a fraudulent letter of intent from a purportedly interested buyer of certain assets to avoid writing down those assets by $17 million in 2017, and Wu improperly hid his personal interest in two companies that received millions in cash and stock from deals with Ideanomics between 2017 and 2019, according to the orders. The SEC further alleged that Ideanomics, Wu, Poor, and Tovar improperly accounted for a deal involving crypto assets in 2019, resulting in the company&rsquo;s overstatement of revenues by more than $40 million, and made false representations in company financial statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we alleged, Ideanomics and its executives defrauded investors, including by misstating its financial statements and failing to disclose material information to investors,&rdquo; said Stacy Bogert, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;The investing public must be able to trust the accuracy of a company&rsquo;s disclosures, and we will hold accountable executives who abuse that trust by engaging in fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order against Wu finds that he violated the antifraud, reporting, internal control, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws and caused certain of the company&rsquo;s violations. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Ideanomics, Poor, and Tovar finds that Ideanomics violated the antifraud, reporting, internal control, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws, and it finds that Poor and Tovar violated the antifraud, reporting, and books and records provisions and caused certain of the company&rsquo;s violations.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, all respondents settled the matter by agreeing to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions. Wu agreed to pay more than $3.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $200,000 penalty. Tovar and Poor each agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty. Ideanomics agreed to pay a $1.4 million penalty and to retain an independent compliance consultant to review, assess, and make recommendations as to the company&rsquo;s internal accounting controls. Finally, Wu agreed to a ten-year officer and director bar, and Tovar agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing before the SEC as an accountant for at least two years.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jason Litow and Brian Palechek and supervised by Pei Chung, Peter Rosario, and Ms. Bogert, with assistance by James Connor, James Carlson, Duane Thompson, Kristen Warden, and David Mendel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.</p>

<div> Draft ITS, credit risk, market risk, IFRS9 models, benchmarking exercise
<br />
Draft ITS amends credit risk, market risk, and IFRS9 models for 2025 exercise. Significant changes in market risk framework, minor changes in credit risk. Data collection deadlines postponed.
<br /><br />Summary:
The EBA published final draft ITS, amending credit risk, market risk, and IFRS9 models for the 2025 exercise. Significant changes in market risk framework, minor changes in credit risk. Data collection deadlines have been postponed. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), amending the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R2070-20240328"><span>Implementing Regulation on the benchmarking</span></a><span>&nbsp;of credit risk, market risk and IFRS9 models for the 2025 exercise. The most significant change is in the area of market risk framework, where&nbsp;</span><a id="_Hlk173158520" name="_Hlk173158520"><span>the EBA is proposing to expand to all asset classes the alternative standardised approach (ASA) validation portfolios compared to the 2024 exercise</span></a><span>. In the area of credit risk, the EBA suggests only minor changes.</span></p>
<p>In the area of market risk, the templates based on the alternative internal model approach (AIMA) have not been implemented because of the adoption of a Delegated Act by the European Commission that&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/capital-requirements-regulation_en">postpones the implementation</a>&nbsp;of the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) in the EU. Therefore, both the content and the sample of banks for the data collection in the area of market risk remain the same as in the 2024 exercise. Compared to the 2024 exercise, the data collection deadlines have been postponed to allow participating banks some more time as a result of the delay in the publication of this amending ITS.</p>
<p>In the area of credit risk, the few amendments clarify, on the one hand, the mandatory nature - if available - of reporting the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) risk parameters in relation to the margin of conservatism (MoC), regulatory add-ons, and downturn components, and, on the other hand, the use of internal model IDs used by the competent authorities.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>This draft ITS have been developed in accordance with article 78 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which requires the EBA to specify the benchmarking portfolios, templates, and definitions to be used as part of the annual benchmarking exercises. These are used by competent authorities to conduct an annual assessment of the quality of internal approaches used for the calculation of own funds requirements.</p>
<p>The EBA annual benchmarking exercise forms the basis for both the supervisory assessment and the horizontal analysis of the outcome of internal models. It ensures consistent monitoring of the variability of own funds requirements resulting from the application of internal models as well as on the impact of the several different supervisory and regulatory measures which influence the capital requirements and solvency ratios in the EU.</p>

<div> Bitcoin, volatility, price, rebound, cryptocurrency <br />
Summary:<br />
Bitcoin's price dropped from $70,000 to $50,000 but rebounded to $60,000 in a week. Market sentiment remains bullish. Mercuryo saw a significant increase in transaction volume. <br /> <div>
<p>Bitcoin has faced significant volatility in recent days. Earlier this week, its price plummeted from $70,000 to approximately $50,000. However, in less than a week, Bitcoin has rebounded to $60,000.</p>
<p>Commenting on these price fluctuations, Arthur Firstov, Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo&mdash;a leading provider of payment infrastructure in the digital token sector&mdash;shared his insights:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is resurgent after a dramatic switch from fear to greed. As the digital token market is pulled higher crypto enthusiasts are once again focusing on the king of crypto breaching the $100,000 mark. While fears over the US economy and events such as Mt. Gox and the selling of Bitcoin by the German government has spooked investors in a week that began with a &lsquo;crypto Black Monday,&rsquo; the overriding sentiment appears to be that the bull market is intact. Regardless, a belief in the underlying technology among an army of retail investors remains unwavering. When the cryptocurrency market crashed on Monday this week, Mercuryo experienced an 82 per cent week-on-week increase in transaction volume amid a stampede of those buying the dip.&rdquo;</p>

<div> regulatory measures, market supervision, investor confidence, Auction Matching Method, Dynamic Price Band
Summary:<br />The Stock Exchange of Thailand implements Auction Matching Method, Dynamic Price Band, and Minimum Resting Time to enhance market supervision and boost investor confidence. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has announced three additional regulatory measures to enhance market supervision and boost investor confidence, following recent amendments to short selling and program trading regulations. The new measures, effective September 2, 2024, are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Auction Matching Method will be required for all investors trading securities that SET has designated as the trading surveillance measures at Level 2 and above, in addition to the existing measures for securities with abnormal trading conditions. </li>
<li>Dynamic Price Band for individual securities of &plusmn;10 percent from the latest execution price will be imposed. This measure will complement the existing daily ceiling and floor price limits of &plusmn;30 percent from the previous day&rsquo;s closing price, providing an additional mechanism to mitigate securities price fluctuation. </li>
<li>Minimum Resting Time before an order can be amended or cancelled is set at 250 milliseconds. This measure aims to curb excessively frequent order updates and cancellations that could potentially mislead the market about high demand for particular securities. </li>
</ol>
<p>For more detailed information, please visit SET's website: <a href="http://www.set.or.th/">www.set.or.th</a> under the menu &ldquo;Rules &amp; Regulations&rdquo; section, then &ldquo;Rules &amp; Circular Letters&rdquo;.</p>

<div> Second cohort, investED Leadership Programme, Malaysian graduates, capital market, industry partners
<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia's investED Leadership Programme aims to enhance employability by offering training and job placements in the capital market industry.
<br /><br />Summary: The investED Leadership Programme provides training and job placements in the capital market industry for Malaysian graduates, in collaboration with industry partners. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has commenced the second cohort of the investED Leadership Programme, an SC-led initiative to help ensure a sustainable talent pipeline for the capital market.</p>
<p>Launched by Prime Minister Dato&rsquo; Seri Anwar Ibrahim in June 2023, the flagship graduate programme is also designed to help enhance the employability of local graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initiative is the first ever such tie-up between the SC, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Higher Education, the capital market industry and universities. investED is opened to all Malaysian graduates from all disciplines.</p>
<p>For the second cohort, the investED Leadership Programme offered placements to 268 trainees. On 1 August 2024, 197 trainees began a one-month comprehensive classroom training at the Asia School of Business in Kuala Lumpur. This will be followed by a sixmonth on-the-job experience with leading industry partners, beginning 1 September 2024.</p>
<p>The first cohort of 169 candidates graduated in February this year after completing a sixmonth job placement with 53 capital market partner companies. More than 65% of them were offered jobs with investED's partners.</p>
<p>This year, the investED programme has roped in a wider array of partner companies. They include investment banks, stockbroking firms, fund management companies, equity crowdfunding platforms, and advisory services.</p>
<p>So far, 50 partner firms have agreed to place the second cohort&rsquo;s trainees. Host companies with the highest placement offered include the SC, Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, Moomoo Securities Sdn Bhd, Hong Leong Group, Affin Hwang Investment Bank and Maybank.</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said the collaboration with the various companies will provide valuable exposure to different aspects of the industry, offering trainees a well-rounded experience.</p>
<p>Since its inception, investED has also engaged 77,185 university students via eight career fairs and 36 career talks nationwide. It plans to engage more students, universities and partner firms this year.</p>
<p>The programme is aimed at improving the capital market knowledge of 9,000 university students and provide up to 600 jobs in the capital market industry between 2023 and 2025.</p>

<p>The Financial advice update is a round-up of regulatory developments and issues affecting financial advice.</p>
<p>It covers all areas of financial advice regulation and includes a broad range of content relevant to Australian financial services (AFS) licensees who are advice licensees and financial advisers.</p>

<li><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/financial-advice-update/#subscribe">keeping up to date with financial advice news</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="maintaining"></a>Maintaining accurate records on the financial advisers register</h2>
<p>AFS licensees are reminded to check that the information about their financial advisers on the financial advisers register is correct. AFS licensees should pay particular attention to their adviser&rsquo;s approved qualification(s), ability to provide tax (financial) advice services, business address and telephone number.</p>
<p>Any incorrect or out-of-date information must be rectified by lodging a &lsquo;maintain&rsquo; transaction on ASIC Connect.</p>
<p>ASIC recently identified errors and inconsistencies on the financial advisers register, including in relation to records of approved degrees and qualifications: see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-142mr-asic-urges-afs-licensees-to-correct-records-on-the-financial-advisers-register/">24-142MR</a>&nbsp;<em>ASIC urges AFS licensees to correct records on the financial advisers register</em>&nbsp;(1 July 2024).</p>
<p>Common errors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>failure to record the degrees accurately in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01848/latest/text"><em>Corporations (Relevant Providers Degrees, Qualifications and Courses Standard) Determination 2021</em></a>&nbsp;(Determination)</li>
<li>recording degrees that are not approved degrees, but are professional designations (e.g. &lsquo;Certified Financial Planner&rsquo;)</li>
<li>recording degrees that are not approved degrees, but are bridging courses (which may be listed in the Determination but must be coupled with another qualification to meet the requirements of the professional standard), and</li>
<li>recording qualifications that are not approved qualifications under the Determination (e.g. the Financial Adviser Exam, Australian Qualifications Framework 1&ndash;5 qualifications, and training or qualifications listed in Regulatory Guide 146&nbsp;<em>Licensing: Training of financial product advisers</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-146-licensing-training-of-financial-product-advisers/" title="RG 146 Licensing: Training of financial product advisers">RG 146</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a serious offence to knowingly provide false or misleading information to ASIC or to fail to take reasonable steps to ensure that the information provided to ASIC is true and correct. It is also an offence to fail to update the financial advisers register within 30 business days of a financial adviser&rsquo;s details changing.</p>
<p>ASIC will shortly be commencing a compliance program to ensure that the information recorded on the financial advisers register about approved qualifications is correct and take action where necessary.</p>
<h2><a id="assessing"></a>Assessing adviser qualifications</h2>
<p>If you are an advice licensee, among other things, you must ensure your relevant providers (i.e. advisers who are authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products) comply with the &lsquo;qualifications standard&rsquo; in section 921B(2) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Corporations Act) before authorising them, even if they have been previously authorised by another advice licensee.</p>
<p>Financial advisers who are existing providers have until 1 January 2026 to meet the qualifications standard. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/quick-reference-guide-applying-the-financial-adviser-professional-standards/" title="Quick reference guide: Applying the financial adviser professional standards">quick reference guide</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website.</p>
<p>Generally, an existing provider who meets the criteria for an experienced provider can rely on the experienced provider pathway to meet the qualifications standard and the professional year standard without needing to undertake further education and training. For more information on the experienced provider pathway, see Information Sheet 281&nbsp;<em>FAQs: Relevant providers &ndash; Accessing the experienced provider pathway</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/faqs-relevant-providers-accessing-the-experienced-provider-pathway/">INFO 281</a>).</p>
<p>Under section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act, a person who is, or is to be, a relevant provider&nbsp;<span>must have completed a bachelor or higher degree, or equivalent qualification, approved by the Minister</span>. This applies to both existing providers and new financial advisers, as well as advisers with foreign qualifications. For a list of approved degrees and equivalent qualifications see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01848/latest/text">Determination</a>.</p>
<h3>Assessing your advisers&rsquo; qualifications against the Determination</h3>
<p>To assess whether your adviser(s) has completed an approved bachelor or higher degree, or equivalent qualification, under the Determination, see the guidance for AFS licensees to check qualifications on the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Qualification, exam and professional development</a>&nbsp;page of the ASIC website.</p>
<p>As an AFS licensee, you must ensure that the qualifications exactly match those listed in the Determination. If a domestic qualification has been completed in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Determination, but does not satisfy the prescribed conditions (e.g. unit codes or names do not match or different commencement dates), then an application can be made to Treasury to assess whether the qualification satisfies section 921B(2) of the Corporations Act: see&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.treasury.gov.au/education-standards/domestic-qualifications">Domestic qualifications: Criteria for assessment</a>&nbsp;on the Treasury website.</p>
<p>If an adviser has foreign qualifications, an application can also be made to Treasury to assess whether these qualifications are equivalent to an Australian bachelor&rsquo;s or higher degree: see&nbsp;<a href="https://fas.treasury.gov.au/education-standards/foreign-qualifications">Foreign qualifications: Criteria for assessment</a>&nbsp;on the Treasury website.</p>
<p>If Treasury establishes that an adviser has completed an approved degree or qualification, the relevant provider&rsquo;s authorising AFS licensee must record this on the financial advisers register as an approved degree or qualification. This can be completed during the appointment process or by submitting a maintenance transaction if the adviser has already been appointed by the AFS licensee.</p>
<h2><a id="cold-calling"></a>ASIC&rsquo;s review of cold calling for superannuation switching business models</h2>
<p>In our 2023&ndash;27 Corporate Plan, ASIC announced a cross-sector project focused on deterring cold calling for superannuation switching business models. Our review identified that some cold calling businesses are using high-pressure sales tactics to induce consumers into taking unnecessary and inappropriate superannuation switching advice, leading to poor outcomes for clients. These adverse outcomes range from superannuation erosion due to high fees and charges, to the risk of a reduced superannuation balance due to inappropriate investment in high-risk and/or low-quality superannuation products.</p>
<p>Some of the cold calling operators &ndash; which make unsolicited calls to consumers after obtaining their personal information from third-party data brokers or by using online click-bait &ndash; have lead-generation and referral arrangements with a small subset of financial advisers who typically recommend consumers switch to super products that charge significant fees.</p>
<p>ASIC has observed considerable volumes of superannuation fund movement as a result of cold calling conduct, including inflow into platforms, high-risk property investments and significant payments to cold calling operators.</p>
<p>ASIC also observed some cold calling businesses bypassing data brokers by posting click-bait advertisements on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These advertisements often promote superannuation comparison calculators that give consumers the impression their existing superannuation fund is underperforming.</p>
<p>ASIC identified several areas of concern and is reminding advice licensees and financial advisers of their respective obligations to act in the best interests of consumers when providing financial services.</p>
<p>Advice licensees should ensure they have in place adequate monitoring and supervision arrangements to detect concerning conduct and to make sure their advisers are acting in the best interests of their clients.</p>
<p>Deterring cold calling for superannuation switching models is an ASIC priority. We will continue to take action, where appropriate &ndash; including enforcement action &ndash; against individuals or entities who are engaging in misconduct.</p>
<p>You can find more information on ASIC&rsquo;s review of cold calling for superannuation switching business models in our news item&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/exposing-high-pressure-cold-calling-tactics-and-social-media-click-bait-leading-to-superannuation-switching/" title="Exposing high-pressure cold calling tactics and social media click-bait leading to superannuation switching">Exposing high-pressure cold calling tactics and social media click-bait leading to superannuation switching</a>&nbsp;(7 May 2024).</p>
<p>We have issued Information Sheet 282&nbsp;<em>Unsolicited contact leading to financial advice</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/unsolicited-contact-leading-to-financial-advice/">INFO 282</a>) for unlicensed entities that engage with consumers, leading to financial advice. It sets out how the financial services laws apply to these entities and reminds them of their responsibility to ensure that their conduct complies with the law.</p>
<p>ASIC has also launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/media-centre/news-asic-warns-consumers-to-just-hang-up-on-superannuation-cold-callers">consumer awareness campaign</a>, encouraging consumers to &lsquo;<span>just hang up</span>&rsquo; when contacted by cold calling operators and to&nbsp;<span>&lsquo;just scroll past&rsquo;</span>&nbsp;social media click-bait advertisements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="cyber"></a>Cyber security &ndash; Third-party exposure</h2>
<p>The practice of outsourcing services and products is crucial to most organisations operating in today&rsquo;s economy, with 76% of leading global businesses outsourcing IT functions. While financial services businesses can outsource their services to third-party suppliers, they cannot outsource the associated risks and liabilities.</p>
<p>Recently, ASIC released findings from our 2023 Cyber Pulse Survey: see Report 776&nbsp;<em>Spotlight on cyber: Findings and insights from the cyber pulse survey</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-776-spotlight-on-cyber-findings-and-insights-from-the-cyber-pulse-survey-2023/" title="REP 776 Spotlight on cyber: Findings and insights from the cyber pulse survey 2023">REP 776</a>). Worryingly, 44% of participating organisations admitted to not managing third-party or supply chain risk.</p>
<p>ASIC has observed a growing number of cyber attacks on Australian organisations stemming from third-party attacks that exploit weaknesses in an organisations supply chain, giving them easy access to the organisation&rsquo;s systems and networks.</p>
<p>AFS licensees from across Australia have told ASIC they consider cyber security the biggest risk to their business, listing it as a high priority item for board meetings and noting they run regular staff training at all levels of their business. AFS licensees have moved to reinforce their internal cyber security after a series of high-profile incidents from late 2022. With many organisations acting to improve internal defences, their focus must now turn to mitigating third-party exposure &ndash; the new frontline in cyber risk management.</p>
<p>For example, the SolarWinds breach of 2020 exploited a vulnerability in SolarWinds&rsquo; platform, giving the threat actor access to 3,000 email accounts across 150 organisations, including government agencies and multinational corporations. The breach cost each affected organisation an average of US$12 million.</p>
<p>To enhance the cyber resilience of Australia&rsquo;s financial institutions against known threat actors, the Council of Financial Regulators (CFR) developed the cyber and operational intelligence-led exercises (CORIE) framework: see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cfr.gov.au/publications/policy-statements-and-other-reports.html#2022">Revised CORIE framework and rollout</a>&nbsp;on the CFR website. CORIE uses threat intelligence to simulate adversary attacks and assess the cyber resilience of an organisation. Recent CORIE simulations have exposed vulnerabilities in third-party controls, including instances where third parties held administrator-level access to critical systems.</p>
<p>The recent Latitude Financial cyber attack underscores the need for enhanced scrutiny of third parties with access to core systems. While IT outsourcing is essential for many organisations, basic controls &ndash; like multifactor authentication (MFA) for external providers &ndash; could minimise breach risks.</p>
<p>Another concerning trend demonstrated by CORIE simulations is the use of weak passwords. Even with complex password creation requirements, users can find ways to craft weak passwords like &lsquo;Pa$$w0rd123!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>MFA is one of the most effective techniques available to protect organisations from a cyber incident. Where MFA is not available, the Australian Signals Directorate&rsquo;s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) recommends the use of passphrases: see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/protect-yourself/securing-your-accounts/passphrases">Passphrases</a>&nbsp;on the ACSC website. These measures should be implemented as part of a broader cultural shift throughout an organisation, driven by employee education, cyber awareness training and rigorous third-party risk assessment.</p>
<p>To mitigate cyber risk, organisations must take an active approach to identifying, assessing, and monitoring third-party cyber risks. We encourage organisations to start by asking three simple questions:</p>

<div class="expandCollapseButtons"><button class="accordionExpand">Expand all</button><button class="accordionCollapse">Collapse all</button></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="registration"></a>Financial adviser registration</h2>
<p>On 16 February 2024, the registration requirement commenced whereby all relevant providers, except provisional relevant providers, must be registered before providing personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products.</p>
<p>The registration requirement is an&nbsp;<span>ongoing obligation</span>&nbsp;and is separate to the requirement for AFS licensees to appoint their relevant providers to the financial advisers register. Self-licensed relevant providers must also be registered. AFS licensees and relevant providers should ensure they understand the circumstances when new registration is required and the circumstances that may lead to a relevant provider being deregistered.</p>
<p>AFS licensees must register their relevant providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>after they authorise and appoint an adviser to the financial advisers register</li>
<li>when they appoint an adviser who has moved from another AFS licensee</li>
<li>when an adviser changes roles from a &lsquo;provisional relevant provider&rsquo; to a &lsquo;relevant provider&rsquo;, and</li>
<li>when an adviser is authorised by two or more AFS licensees and registered by one, and the adviser&rsquo;s authorisation with their registering AFS licensee ceases.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 16 February 2024, both the AFS licensee and the relevant provider will be in breach of the law if an unregistered relevant provider provides personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products.</p>
<p>ASIC recently commenced a compliance program in relation to the registration requirement and has already identified that a number of advisers have not been registered following their move from one AFS licensee to another. In order to avoid regulatory action, please ensure all your advisers are currently registered, particularly those who have changed AFS licensee since 16 February 2024.</p>

<h2><a id="rep-779"></a>Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em></h2>
<p>Around $1.1 trillion of Australians&rsquo; total retirement savings are invested in the choice product segment. The decision of where to invest these savings is one of the most important decisions a member will make &ndash; and is often made based on recommendations by a financial adviser.</p>
<p>A 2018 Productivity Commission inquiry and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority&rsquo;s (APRA) annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/choice-heatmap">Choice Heatmap</a>&nbsp;highlighted persistent underperformance of some investment options within the choice sector. In 2023, APRA found one in five choice investment options with an 8-year history significantly underperformed the investment return benchmarks.</p>
<p>To understand why some choice super fund members remained in these poorly performing investment options, we looked at what superannuation trustees, financial advisers and advice licensees did in relation to performance. Each of these stakeholders is responsible for assisting Australians to achieve good retirement outcomes.</p>
<p>Financial advisers have an important role, and their clients (i.e. fund members) trust them to act in their best interests when providing advice about how to achieve their retirement objectives.</p>
<p>On 21 February 2024, we published our observations in Report 779&nbsp;<em>Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">REP 779</a>).</p>

<p>In March 2017, the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Amendment (Professional Standards of Financial Advisers) Act 2017&nbsp;</em>commenced and introduced reforms to the Corporations Act to raise the education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers. The professional standards require financial advisers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have an approved qualification</li>
<li>pass the financial adviser exam</li>
<li>participate in 40 hours of continuing professional development each year, and</li>
<li>comply with the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00117">Code of Ethics</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to become a financial adviser must also complete a full-time professional year that includes at least 1,500 hours of work and activities and 100 hours of structured training (a total of 1,600 hours).</p>
<p>For more information about the professional standards, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards-for-financial-advisers/qualification-exam-and-professional-development/" title="Qualification, exam and professional development">Qualification, exam and professional development</a>&nbsp;on the ASIC website, and</li>
<li>the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00117">Code of Ethics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ASIC&rsquo;s supervision activities, we conducted a review with a cross section of AFS licensees, which included understanding their experience with employing a provisional relevant provider. We asked them details about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the process for taking on the responsibility of training and supervising a provisional relevant provider</li>
<li>the processes they used to verify and record training hours</li>
<li>how they selected and monitored the supervisor of the provisional relevant provider, and</li>
<li>the process for certifying the provisional relevant provider has meet all of the requirements for completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All licensees involved reported a positive experience of supporting a provisional relevant provider through their professional year. Some listed the benefits as supporting and assisting with their succession planning, and appreciated that they could mentor and train a provisional relevant provider from within the business rather than hiring an external adviser.</p>
<p>We also observed licensee practices that could be improved, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>putting policies in place about who is qualified and suitable to be a supervisor</li>
<li>developing processes for how licensees will monitor professional relevant providers and the supervisor, including their advice, once the provisional relevant provider is in the third and fourth quarters of their professional year, and</li>
<li>having detailed processes in place for final sign off of the completion certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFS licensees are reminded of the importance of record keeping throughout the professional year. Most licensees indicated they were able to comply with the record-keeping obligations by using, and in some cases amending, the templates created by the former standards body, the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority. Others created their own methods for maintaining logbooks to record the structured and unstructured training hours, and to demonstrate and record that all key competencies were satisfactorily acquired.</p>

<title>Concurring Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Joint Data Standards Proposal</title>

<div> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Financial Data Transparency Act, Joint Data Standards Proposal, regulated entities, costs <br />
<br />
Summary: The author supports the Financial Data Transparency Act but urges consideration of the costs imposed on regulated entities.<br /> <div>
<p><span>I respectfully concur from the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Financial Data Transparency Act (FDTA) Joint Data Standards (&ldquo;Joint Data Standards Proposal&rdquo;) to require each respective agency to implement certain data standards for its regulated entities because there is insufficient discussion of the impact and costs associated with the adoption of these new data standards that will apply across the banking and financial services sector (including small entities as set forth under the Regulatory Flexibility Act). &nbsp;While I support the FDTA&rsquo;s mandate, I believe the Joint Data Standards Proposal would be improved by addressing head-on the elephant in the room&mdash;the very real costs that will be imposed on potentially tens of thousands of firms of all sizes that will eventually have to update their systems and records to adhere to the new data standards. I encourage all commenters to address the costs and benefits of the Joint Data Standards Proposal, including the necessary future agency rulemakings that will subsequently follow. I thank Ted Kaouk, Tom Guerin, Jeffrey Burns, and the staff of the CFTC, and all the other agencies for their efforts on this proposal.</span></p>

<title>CFTC Approves A Joint Rule Proposal To Establish Technical Data Reporting Standards</title>

<div> standards, data reporting, financial regulatory agencies, Financial Data Transparency Act, public comment
Summary:<br /> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed uniform data standards for reporting to multiple financial regulatory agencies, promoting interoperability and common identifiers.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today voted to jointly propose and request public comment on the establishment of technical data reporting standards with other financial regulatory agencies. The proposal would establish uniform data standards for the collections of information reported to the CFTC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Department of the Treasury. The proposal would also establish uniform data standards for data collected from these financial regulatory agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Comments on the proposal are due 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposed standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the financial regulatory agencies through the adoption of common identifiers for legal entities, financial instruments, and other data. In addition to proposing the use of common identifiers, the proposal would also further standardize the format and transmission of data to financial regulatory agencies.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposed rule is part of the implementation of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (FDTA). Although the CFTC is not specifically referenced in the FDTA, the Secretary of the Treasury designated the CFTC as a covered agency on May 3, 2024. While the designation does not require the CFTC to issue individual rules adopting the proposed technical data reporting standards, this request for comment will give interested parties an opportunity to provide input at this early stage.</span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Awards Over $1 Million To Whistleblower Who Aided A Digital Assets-Related Investigation</title>

<div> whistleblower, CFTC, digital assets, enforcement action, whistleblower program
Summary: The CFTC awarded a whistleblower over $1 million for information about digital asset misconduct, highlighting the program's success in tackling violations and protecting whistleblowers. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced a whistleblower award of over $1 million to a whistleblower who provided significant information and assistance that led the CFTC to bring an enforcement action connected to digital asset markets.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Identifying unlawful conduct in the digital asset marketplace is a major priority for the CFTC, especially as everyday Americans are increasingly victimized by digital asset scams,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;During the last fiscal year, digital asset cases accounted for almost 50% of the CFTC&rsquo;s docket, and the majority of whistleblower tips that year were related to digital assets.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Whistleblowers have increasingly played a significant role in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement actions in the digital assets space,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, the whistleblower provided sufficiently specific and credible information that assisted the CFTC in bringing a successful action.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>CFTC based its enforcement action on&nbsp;<span>whistleblower</span>-<span>provided information about improper trading&nbsp;</span>that was unknown to&nbsp;<span>the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $380 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling nearly $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Getting To Grips With Treasury Clearing</title>

<div> SEC, US Treasury, reforms, documentation, market liquidity
Summary:
SEC US Treasury reforms require extensive documentation, recalibration of capital rules, and resolution of legal and operational issues. Collaboration is vital for successful implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>When it comes to the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) US Treasury reforms, one thing is very clear: there&rsquo;s an awful lot to do and not a lot of time to do it. From the development of documentation to the recalibration of certain capital rules, there&rsquo;s an enormous laundry list of tasks that needs to be worked through &ndash; something that will require time and a collective effort from the entire industry.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247">SEC finalized its regulations last December</a>, which include a requirement to clear certain Treasury cash transactions from December 31 next year and Treasury repos from June 30, 2026. Among other things, market participants will need to assess existing and future clearing models to determine which best suits their needs. Legal documentation will need to be developed, negotiated and executed, and regulatory-compliant structures for the segregation of client margin will need to be put in place and tested. All of this work comes against a backdrop of concern about the need to maintain and enhance market liquidity, particularly during periods of stress.</p>
<p>For our part, ISDA will continue to engage closely with members and regulators and assist with implementation where we can. SIFMA is leading the work to develop the documentation, and we&rsquo;re participating in that working group. ISDA is also providing input on the optimal clearing models. We&rsquo;ve published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/02/23/isda-clearing-model-comparison/">comparison of various clearing models</a>&nbsp;for US Treasury transactions and derivatives that will be updated as new models emerge, and we recently submitted responses to the SEC on proposed rule changes by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) &ndash; one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/17/isda-submits-comments-to-ficc-on-proposed-rule-changes/">clearing models and margin segregation</a>&nbsp;and one on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/08/06/isda-letter-on-ficcs-proposed-rulebook-changes/">trade submission requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Solving these legal and operational issues will be critical, but it&rsquo;s also important that the US prudential framework is calibrated so it is risk appropriate and supports market liquidity.</p>
<p>One example is the lack of recognition in the revised US capital framework for cross-margining programs, such as the one offered by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/january/23/cme-group-and-dtcc-launch-treasury-cross-margining-arrangement-for-clearing-members">FICC and CME Group</a>&nbsp;for transactions based on US Treasury securities and interest rate futures &ndash; an issue ISDA is exploring in partnership with FIA. These services allow firms to obtain initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of transactions, but there are no commensurate benefits from a capital perspective under the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. As more Treasury securities and repos are cleared as a result of the SEC&rsquo;s rule, a lack of recognition for cross-margining will constrain bank balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing.</p>
<p>ISDA has also worked with SIFMA to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">propose several calibration changes</a>&nbsp;to the Basel III endgame proposals and the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIB) to ensure the rules do not disproportionately hamper the ability of banks to act as intermediaries. These include changes to certain aspects of the rules for credit valuation adjustment and modifications to the complexity and interconnectedness categories of the G-SIB surcharge, following analysis that the current proposals would increase capital for client clearing businesses at US G-SIBs by more than 80%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on top of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/05/isda-submits-letter-to-us-agencies-on-slr-reform/">letter we sent to US prudential regulators</a>&nbsp;earlier this year drawing attention to the fact that the non-risk-based supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) may impede banks&rsquo; capacity to participate in US Treasury markets and facilitate access to cleared markets, especially during periods of stress. We believe this is something that should be carefully assessed by regulators.</p>
<p>All of these issues need to be resolved before we&rsquo;re in a position to implement Treasury clearing safely and efficiently. The question is whether they can be completed in the time available, and this is something we&rsquo;ll be discussing with members in the coming months. In the meantime, we encourage all market participants to engage with the relevant working groups at ISDA or elsewhere &ndash; everyone will need to work together to get this done.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson: Prioritizing Customer Protection And Combatting Fraud By FTX And Alameda</title>

<div> Commodity Futures Trading Commission, historic judgment, FTX Trading Ltd., Alameda Research LLC, fraud <br />
Summary:<br />Today, the CFTC announced a historic $12.7 billion settlement with FTX and Alameda for fraud, lack of customer protections, and conflicts of interest. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>Introduction</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Today, in a historic judgment with a $12.7 billion settlement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) announced the entry of a consent order in its litigation against FTX Trading Ltd. (FTX) and Alameda Research LLC (Alameda). Today&rsquo;s announcement sends a clear message regarding the Commission&rsquo;s intent to hold fraudsters accountable. The consent order, entered by Judge P. Kevin Castel of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against FTX and Alameda filed on December 13, 2022.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;The amended complaint charged defendants with two counts of fraud and material misrepresentations in connection with the sale of digital assets and alleged that defendants&rsquo; actions caused the loss of billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FTX and Alameda have agreed to findings of liability on each of the charges alleged in the amended complaint. The consent order, among other obligations, imposes:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>$8.7 billion in restitution;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>$4 billion in disgorgement;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A permanent injunction prohibiting FTX and Alameda from engaging in further violations of the charged Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>A permanent injunction prohibiting FTX and Alameda from trading for themselves or others, soliciting or accepting funds for trading, registering or claiming an exemption from registration with the Commission in any capacity, or acting as a principal of any registered person.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>The total restitution and disgorgement amount of $12.7 billion is a historic judgment that will enable the Commission to compensate victims for the losses they suffered as a result of this massive fraud.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s resolution demonstrates the Commission&rsquo;s strong commitment to achieving accountability, deterring future misconduct, and promoting compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations. The resolution sends a clear message that fraud in the derivatives markets will not be tolerated and that wrongdoers will be held accountable.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I commend the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement and the Commission on today&rsquo;s landmark resolution. Yet, much work is left to be done. Going forward, we must prioritize efforts to protect customers in markets with regulatory gaps, where customers may be at higher risk due to the absence of adequate safeguards.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have called on the Commission before, and I do so again today, to take urgent action to adopt a holistic rule that directly addresses concerns such as conflicts of interest, risk management, transparency and oversight.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Every market for every asset subject to the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction must have effective customer protections including, for example, segregation of customer funds, property, and assets.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Customer Protection Rules are the Cornerstone of Vibrant Derivatives Markets and a Well-Functioning Financial System</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The vibrancy of derivatives markets depends on customers&rsquo; ability to trust that their funds will be safely held by custodians. Customers must be assured that their hard-earned money will not be misused, lost, or worse yet, stolen, by those whom they have entrusted with its safekeeping. In the absence of trust, the custodial relationship cannot thrive, derivatives markets suffer, and the entire financial system is harmed. Customer protection rules, in particular those rules protecting customer funds, are therefore crucial to the vibrancy of derivatives markets and a well-functioning financial system.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span>As directed by the CEA, the Commission has developed, adopted, and implemented rules that protect customers in derivatives markets, including rules that protect customer funds, property, and other assets</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;held by a custodian. Such rules require custodians to segregate and separately account for customer funds. A custodian may not commingle customer funds.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As additional safety measures, custodians must also meet certain minimum capital requirements, file periodic and annual financial reports, maintain books and records, be subject to examinations, and comply with a host of other obligations. These measures are intended to promote transparency, monitor and manage risks, and enable oversight over the activities of custodians.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Notwithstanding the Commission&rsquo;s customer protection rules and efforts to preserve customer funds, customers have experienced significant losses in both heavily regulated markets as well as emerging markets, such as in the digital asset and cryptocurrency space. The rise of retail participation in emerging markets adds to the urgency of ensuring that customer funds are protected and that the integrity and stability of our markets is maintained.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>An Absence of Customer Protection Rules and Gaps in Regulation Enabled FTX to Misappropriate Billions of Dollars in Customer Funds</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On November 11, 2022, customers and our markets experienced the devastating effects of the precipitous collapse and shocking bankruptcy of FTX, which resulted in the loss of over $10 billion in customer funds.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span>&nbsp;Investigations into FTX&rsquo;s demise revealed a concerning lack of customer protections, including commingling of customer funds, using customer funds to extend a line of credit to an affiliate, and investing customer funds in nonpermitted investments through an affiliate, among others. Customers and the public were not alerted to FTX&rsquo;s ongoing misconduct due to the absence of crucial regulation over digital assets needed to establish appropriate risk management mechanisms to address conflicts of interest and other related issues, a lack of transparency, and inadequate oversight.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Conflicts of Interest Plagued FTX and Alameda</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>From the beginning, FTX and Alameda had significant conflicts of interest issues stemming from their vertically-integrated market structure. A gap in regulation, however, allowed these issues to go unaddressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Bankman-Fried founded Alameda in November 2017, as a digital asset trading and investment firm. In late 2018, he and other Alameda employees began to build what would ultimately become FTX, a centralized digital asset trading platform. Once FTX was launched, no later than May 2019, Alameda began operating as the primary market maker on FTX&rsquo;s trading platform. Bankman-Fried controlled both FTX and Alameda, serving as a signatory on core corporate agreements and bank accounts for both entities. Throughout their operations, FTX and Alameda regularly shared employees, office space, systems, communication channels, and accounts. FTX and Alameda relied on each other&rsquo;s personnel, assets and resources to conduct their operations. FTX and Alameda also regularly transferred large amounts of assets between the entities, often without documentation or effective tracking.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have raised the alarm, time and time again, about conflicts of interest and other concerns in emerging asset classes and the urgent need for the Commission to adopt a holistic rule that addresses these issues.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Segregation and Restrictions on the Use and Investment of Customer Funds are Fundamental Customer Protections</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At the core of customer protection rules is the fundamental principle that custodians must segregate and separately account for customer funds that they receive to margin, guarantee or secure the trades of the customer. A custodian is strictly prohibited from commingling customer funds with its own funds and from using or investing customer funds in violation of the CEA and Commission regulations.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span>Transparency and Oversight are Crucial to Detecting and Preventing Misconduct</span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Disclosures, reporting and examinations are critical to creating transparency into business operations and functions and enabling customers and the public to have proper oversight over business conduct. It is imperative that the Commission and other regulators have proper oversight and transparency into the digital asset and cryptocurrency ecosystem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On November 11, 2022, FTX and more than 100 of its affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. FTX&rsquo;s collapse unleashed a wave of failures across the digital asset and cryptocurrency ecosystem and left numerous customers with devastating losses.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On December 13, 2022, in the criminal case parallel to the Commission&rsquo;s civil case, the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York indicted Bankman-Fried on eight counts, including fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses.</span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatment080824#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span>In November 2023, jurors found Bankman-Fried guilty of misappropriating billions of dollars in customer funds deposited with FTX. Bankman-Fried was convicted of two counts of wire fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. On March 28, 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in this massive fraud scheme and has begun serving his sentence.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>FTX&rsquo;s failure and the catastrophic consequences of its collapse confirm that there is no time to waste. The time is now for the Commission to adopt a comprehensive rule addressing customer protections.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I commend the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, including Carlin Metzger, Nina Ruvinsky, Yusuf Capar, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R. Williamson, and Robert T. Howell, for their work on this matter.</span></span></span></p>

<title>CFTC Obtains $12.7 Billion Judgment Against FTX And Alameda - Restitution And Disgorgement Damages To Pay Fraud Victims</title>

<div> CFTC, FTX, fraud, injunction, restitution
Summary:<br /><br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission obtained a $12.7 billion judgment against FTX for fraud and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The judgment includes restitution and disgorgement. FTX falsely represented its safety and security to customers. The CFTC will not seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX and will subordinate its monetary claims to those of the victims of the FTX fraud scheme. The CFTC complaint charged Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX, and two former FTX executives with orchestrating a scheme to defraud. The court entered consent orders of judgment on liability against two former FTX executives, leaving the case pending as to the four individual defendants including Bankman-Fried. The CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded victims, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a consent order of permanent injunction and other equitable relief against&nbsp;FTX Trading Ltd.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alameda Research LLC&nbsp;(together, FTX) and ordered FTX to pay $12.7 billion in monetary relief to FTX customers and victims of FTX&rsquo;s fraud. The order requires FTX to pay $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement, which will be used to further compensate victims for losses suffered as a result of the massive fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Samuel Bankman-Fried, his now-bankrupt FTX group of companies, and a core group of FTX insiders. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8638-22">8638-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8644-22">8644-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23">8669-23</a>].&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the order finds FTX violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, imposes injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations as well as trading and registration prohibitions, and requires FTX and Alameda to cooperate with the CFTC in its ongoing litigation. The order finds FTX and Alameda made material misrepresentations and omissions to customers. The court noted that FTX touted itself as &ldquo;the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto,&rdquo; and that customer assets, including digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether, were held in &ldquo;custody&rdquo; by FTX while stating FTX segregated customer assets from FTX&rsquo;s own assets as a general principle, when in fact customer funds were commingled and misappropriated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a related settlement agreement approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the CFTC agreed not to seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX and to subordinate its monetary claims to those of victims of the FTX fraud scheme. As described by FTX in its proposed reorganization plan filed in the bankruptcy proceeding, payments by FTX towards its CFTC disgorgement obligation will be used to further compensate victims through a supplemental remission fund. The plan remains subject to approval in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>FTX used age-old tactics to create an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets. But the basic regulatory tools, like governance, customer protections, and surveillance that exist to identify misconduct and ultimately prevent collapse, were simply not there,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like countless other CFTC crypto resolutions, including major players&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8837-23">Binance</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8412-21">BitMEX</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8450-21">Tether</a>, this resolution with FTX is consistent with the enforcement commitments I have long made as Chairman. But, as I have been saying for years, this is just the tip of the iceberg. In the absence of digital asset legislation to fill regulatory gaps, entities will continue to operate in the shadows without these basic tools of sound regulation, sharpening their deceptive practices and continuing to dupe customers."</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement Director Ian McGinley added,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only is this multi-billion dollar recovery for victims the largest such recovery in CFTC history, we achieved it with remarkable speed. FTX&rsquo;s massive fraud collapsed 21 months ago and in that time the CFTC investigated, filed a complaint, and achieved what many thought was impossible at the time of the collapse - a resolution to compensate victims for the losses they suffered. I commend our Chicago-based team for their tireless efforts on behalf of FTX&rsquo;s victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The consent order stems from the CFTC complaint filed December 13, 2022 against Bankman-Fried and FTX, and amended December 21, 2022, to include two former FTX executives, Caroline Ellison and Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang. The CFTC complaint charged Bankman-Fried, who controlled FTX and Alameda, with orchestrating a scheme to defraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court entered consent orders of judgment on liability against Wang and Ellison on December 23, 2022. In a related case, the court entered a consent order of judgment as to liability and partial injunctive relief against Nishad Singh, a third FTX insider, on April 13, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against FTX, leaving the case pending as to the four individual defendants including Bankman-Fried. In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded victims, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Tax Division.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Carlin Metzger, Nina Ruvinsky, Yusuf Capar, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R. Williamson, Robert T. Howell, Gretchen Lowe, and former staff member Bryan Hsueh.</p>
<p>Alex Case, Margaret Aisenbrey, and Anne Stukes of the Office of General Counsel also contributed to this matter.</p>

The Group aims to raise 70 million euros to finance the Company's next growth phase by issuing 1.750.000.000 new shares.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img title="One Verdi Park, One United Properties landmark residential development in Bucharest, Romania" /></p>
</div>
<p><i>"Since becoming a public company, we have consistently delivered on the promises made to our investors, with a clear focus on expanding our business. Our successful IPO in 2021 was a pivotal moment that enabled our strategic expansion into the premium residential segment, exemplified by the remarkable success of One Cotroceni Park. Similarly, our office division, which now boasts a 95% lease ratio, has fulfilled our commitment to investors, driven by our belief that Bucharest deserves world-class office spaces to establish itself as a leading European work hub. Today, our construction sites span 12 developments, comprising more than 4,000 residential units and nearly 45,000 sqm of office and commercial spaces. Our vision for the future includes entering the affordable premium housing segment, where we see significant growth potential. The planned share capital increase is the next milestone for this growth, and we invite our esteemed shareholders to participate and increase their investment in One United Properties by approximately 10% of their existing holdings. This capital infusion accelerates our ambitious growth plans, positioning us to double our business within the next five years and potentially quadruple it over the next decade, while maintaining our LTV at a prudent level,"&nbsp;</i>said Victor Capitanu, co-CEO of One United Properties.</p>
<p>The share capital increase operation will be organized in two stages. In the first stage, the shareholders who purchased ONE shares by the date of guaranteed participation, August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024, will be entitled to subscribe the new shares, respecting the preference rights, at the nominal value of 0.2 lei. The preference rights, having symbol ONER03, were loaded in the shareholders' accounts on August 7<sup>th</sup>. The preference right will be tradeable on the Main Market of the Bucharest Stock Exchange between August 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 13<sup>th</sup>. Therefore, those who want to subscribe to new shares but do not have any or sufficient preference rights will be able to buy them at the price set in the market.</p>
<p>The first stage of the share capital increase will start on August 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and will last for 32 calendar days, until September 19<sup>th</sup>. To subscribe to one new share in stage 1 of the share capital increase at 0.2 lei, an investor must hold 2,1879186 ONER03 preference rights. The shares that remain unsubscribed during the first stage might be offered in a private placement at a price established by the Board of Directors decision, considering the price formed during the bookbuilding process.</p>
<p>60% of the capital intended to be raised by the Company has already been committed by the two co-founders and executive members of the Board of Directors, Victor Capitanu and Andrei Diaconescu, as well as the Chairman of the Board, Claudio Cisullo and Board Member, Marius Diaconu.</p>
<p>The capital raised in the share capital increase operation will be used to expand One United Properties' addressable market beyond its current residential segment focus of luxury, high-end, and premium developments and will accelerate the development of the affordable premium residential segment, which targets Bucharest's middle class. The Company has land under negotiation for 10,000 residential units exclusively for this sub-segment, with the first memorandum of understanding for a 21-hectare plot of land that will host 5,000 units already signed.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, One United Properties sold and pre-sold 452 apartments and commercial units with a total surface of 43,809 sqm, 624 parking spaces, and other unit types for 123.3 million euros. At the end of May 2024, pre-sales started at the second phase of One Lake District, where 867 units are being built. Consequently, as of June 30th, 2024, 66% of the available units under development and delivered were sold out.</p>
<p>As of June 30th, 2024, One United Properties had&nbsp;in ownership, or under pre-SPA, 285,100 sqm&nbsp;of land locations for further development, with total above-ground gross building rights (GBA) of approximately 988,000 sqm. All these land plots are currently in the planning phase. The Group estimates the construction of&nbsp;7,000 apartments, services for communities, and 146,000 sqm of rental commercial buildings.&nbsp;Out of the commercial buildings, 121,000 sqm will host offices and the remaining 25,000 sqm are located within buildings that will undergo restoration.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Progresses Framework For Driving Long-Term Value For Workplace Pension Savers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-progresses-framework-for-driving-long-term-value/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Regulatory framework, pension schemes, transparency, value, performance
Regulatory bodies propose a new framework to focus on long-term value and performance, not just costs, ultimately providing better retirement savings.<br /><br />Summary:
The Financial Conduct Authority, Department for Work and Pensions, and Pensions Regulator are collaborating to implement a new framework focusing on long-term value and performance for pension schemes. <div>
<p align="left">Pensions savers stand to benefit from a new proposed framework designed to shift the focus from costs to long term value, and ultimately deliver better retirement savings. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Pensions Regulator (TPR) aim to implement a joint framework for workplace defined contribution schemes.</p>
<p align="left">The joint framework would be used by pension providers and those making decisions on behalf of savers to provide greater transparency over how schemes are performing.</p>
<p align="left">Schemes will be compared on public metrics that demonstrate value &ndash; not just costs and charges, but also investment performance, and service quality. They would, once the final framework is decided, be publicly rated red, amber or green.</p>
<p align="left">Poorly performing schemes will be required to improve or ultimately protect savers by transferring them to better schemes. This should lead to better value pensions, without savers themselves having to take action.</p>
<p align="left">The proposals will also support the FCA&rsquo;s secondary growth and competitiveness objective. Focusing on value rather than costs will enable providers to invest in assets which could deliver greater long-term returns but have higher management costs, such as infrastructure or venture capital.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Markets and International at the FCA</strong>, said:</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;16 million people save for their retirement into defined contribution pension schemes. We&rsquo;re working with the government and the Pensions Regulator to help them get better returns.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We want to see a focus on long-term value, not just costs and charges. Given the impact these changes could have we are consulting now to ensure that the pension system can be ready to go when the legislative changes that need to happen are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Emma Reynolds MP, Minister for Pensions</strong>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Last year, over &pound;130 billion was saved into workplace pension schemes &ndash; money which we want to see working hard for future pensioners to give them better retirement incomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Our Pension Bill and Pensions Review will make pensions fit for the future, and having an effective Value for Money framework will lay the foundations for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">"I would encourage responses from across the industry, including trust-based schemes, to this consultation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Nausicaa Delfas, Chief Executive of The Pensions Regulator</strong>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We want every pension saver to get value for money from their pensions. That means good investment returns, and high-quality services, for a competitive price.&nbsp; This is a great opportunity for the pensions industry to help to transform pension saving for millions, and to deliver greater value for their retirement.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The FCA is seeking feedback on the framework for pension schemes it regulates. The Government has recently announced its intention to legislate so that the framework can also apply to schemes regulated by TPR, and feedback is also invited in relation to these schemes. Responses will be shared with the Government and TPR to support swift development of a consistent approach once legislation is in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The framework is one of a number of joint initiatives to deliver better outcomes for pension savers including the Advice Guidance Boundary Review and the Pensions Dashboard.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A copy of the consultation paper is available to journalists only, on request from the press office.</li>
<li><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/feedback-statements/fs23-3-government-regulator-response-value-money-framework-metrics-standards-disclosures" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FS23/3: Government-regulator response to &lsquo;Value for Money: A framework on metrics, standards and disclosures&rsquo;</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA regulates contract-based pensions, which involve a contract between an individual and the pension provider</li>
<li>TPR regulates trust-based pension schemes, which have a board of trustees overseeing the scheme</li>
<li>The Government has recently announced its intention for a Pension Schemes Bill which includes legislating for the VFM framework to apply across the market, including schemes regulated by TPR, alongside other measures when Parliamentary time allows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

India's VC landscape in H1 2024 sees 45.3% increase in funding value, with larger investments and declining deal volume. India ranks high globally.<br />
Investors' confidence in Indian startups<br />
572 VC deals worth $5.6 billion in H1 2024<br />
India accounts for 7% global VC deals, 4.4% funding value<br />
Summary: India's VC landscape in H1 2024 reflects larger investments, declining deal volume, and growing global standing, indicating confidence in Indian startups. <div>
<p><span><span>India&rsquo;s venture capital (VC) landscape during the first half (H1) of 2024 highlights a strategic shift towards relatively larger investments, as reflected by the 45.3% increase in disclosed funding value year-on-year (YoY) despite a 2.1% drop in deal volume. This trend signifies investors&rsquo; growing confidence in high-potential startups, with significant deals like Zepto&rsquo;s $665 million and Meesho&rsquo;s $300 million fundraisings pointing to a robust future for the Indian startup ecosystem, says&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.b00YhNV2Nr0-2BaZn7eVNAdXV19MDZH7kb0yQVOf6WtC8eObQvQmU18OGm4LpUDS-2BPjOqK_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7C3K7RHp5Gm5XPA4ohOQ9tAuGjMYZPJBg8hgZ6p1U8S2f8AYJJJhbVbcQAPDEXY5yyigHMydLCriGxP6JYurFEC51QJuUIuipw5rPDWc7I7VOSHeYH-2BBiiQ7CjUBRhbTP48sckB2M280h-2FchqsuiATg-2FM-2FrT23GpBAOXlKr2c3TOiufKjlSUH0GvLKggUORRlK-2FzCwFlwVQdp94zZWnU2mCqANgo-2BBrjwl-2BHhoMhX5b78-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The massive jump in VC funding value despite a decline in deal volume can be seen as an indicator of improving investors&rsquo; appetite for big investments while also adopting a cautious approach. This can also be understood from the fact that the average size of VC deals increased from $6.5 million in H1 2023 to $9.7 million in H1 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in India during H1 2024 include $665 million worth of funding raised by Zepto, $300 million raised by Meesho, $216 million raised by PharmEasy, $150 million raised by Radiance, and $148 million raised by Kogta Financia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose adds: &ldquo;India, apart from being a leading APAC market for VC funding activity and standing just next to China in terms of both deals volume as well as value, is also among the top five markets globally.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>India accounted for 7% share of the total number of VC funding deals announced globally during H1 2024 while its share of the corresponding disclosed funding value stood at 4.4%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;As investors continue to pour substantial funding into promising startups, it underscores the improving confidence in India&rsquo;s market potential. This not only bolsters the country&rsquo;s standing in the global VC landscape but also sets the stage for a vibrant and resilient startup ecosystem poised for dynamic growth in the coming years.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<div> Derivatives, Volume, Growth, SDAV, STI
Summary:<br />Derivatives volume rose 15% y-o-y. FX futures reached record volume. New interest-rate hedging tools introduced. Commodities and equity derivatives also gained. SDAV and STI outpaced peers. Mainboard listing welcomed. <div>
<ul type="square">
<li><span>Derivatives volume rises as global investors turn to our marketplaces to manage risk amid heightened volatility</span></li>
<li><span>SDAV growth and STI outpace peers across Southeast Asia</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for July 2024. Activity in SGX Group&rsquo;s marketplaces increased across asset classes as global investors managed portfolio risks in response to manifold economic and political developments during a volatile month. Derivatives traded volume gained 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 23.5 million contracts.</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, SGX Group&rsquo;s Japan-access derivatives suite enabled market participants to manage risk around Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions. As the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate and announced plans to slow its monthly bond purchases, the volume of SGX three-month Tokyo Overnight Average (TONA) Futures topped 532 lots following the contract&rsquo;s debut on 29 July, while month-end open interest (OI) in SGX Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures rose 21% month-on-month (m-o-m). In addition, the pioneering SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures saw 52,504 lots (US$6.8 billion notional) traded on 31 July &ndash; up 36% over the daily average for the month.</p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Record FX futures volume:&nbsp;</span>total futures traded volume on SGX FX climbed 44% y-o-y in July to 4.8 million contracts, an all-time high. Gains were led by SGX USD/CNH FX Futures &ndash; the world&rsquo;s most widely traded international renminbi futures &ndash; with volume up 40% y-o-y at a record 2.9 million contracts, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 48% y-o-y to 1.6 million contracts. Anticipation of rate decisions by the BOJ and the Federal Reserve, as well as uncertainties over the U.S. presidential elections, fuelled volatility and bolstered portfolio hedging.</li>
<li><span>New interest-rate hedging tools with focus on central banks:&nbsp;</span>SGX Fixed Income&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20240312-sgx-group-launch-interest-rate-derivatives-2h-2024">launched</a>&nbsp;three-month TONA and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) Futures on 29 July, as investors seek more accessible and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. The contracts build upon SGX&rsquo;s offering of long-term interest rate futures comprising 10-year Full-Sized and Mini JGB futures.</li>
<li><span>Broad-based commodities gains, with record dairy OI:</span>&nbsp;Commodity derivatives traded volume rose 20% y-o-y in July to 5.1 million contracts, with bellwether iron ore derivatives volume up 22% y-o-y on elevated risk management amid diverse views on China&rsquo;s growth outlook. Over the first seven months of 2024, 13.3 million metric tonnes (MT) of petrochemicals derivatives have traded on SGX Commodities, close to the 13.4 million MT cleared in all of 2023. Dairy derivatives OI set a single-day record of 171,335 lots on 16 July, rounding off the month with a record average of 106,386 lots.</li>
<li><span>Highest SIMSCI OI notional value in more than four years:</span>&nbsp;OI in SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures rose 42% y-o-y in July to 221,551 lots, with notional value surpassing US$5 billion for the first time since January 2020 amid strong buyside interest in safe-haven markets. SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures volume gained 15% y-o-y, as overnight volumes climbed to a peak of 53,029 lots (US$4.1 billion notional) on 18 July following the release of chipmaker TSMC&rsquo;s earnings. On SGX Equity Derivatives, total equity index futures volume increased 5% y-o-y to 13.1 million contracts.</li>
<li><span>SDAV growth leads region:</span>&nbsp;Securities daily average value (SDAV) rose 13% y-o-y and 4% m-o-m in July to S$1.2 billion against declines across Southeast Asia, with higher retail activity across stock segments. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 3.7% m-o-m to 3,455.94, also outpacing peers across ASEAN and Developed Asia, with year-to-date returns of 6.7%. During the month, Singapore&rsquo;s stock market remained the second most-actively traded in Southeast Asia. Total securities market turnover value increased 23% y-o-y and 26% m-o-m to S$26.5 billion.</li>
<li><span>Record REIT ETF turnover:</span>&nbsp;The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) jumped 48% m-o-m in July to S$404 million. For real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, active participation from retail and robo-advisors lifted trading to a record S$131 million. Turnover of daily leverage certificates (DLC) surged 36% m-o-m to S$219 million, with Singapore-underlying DLCs showing the most increases.</li>
<li><span>Mainboard listing:&nbsp;</span>SGX Securities welcomed the secondary listing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20240719-sgx-securities-welcomes-helens-international-holdings-company">Helens International Holdings Company Limited</a>&nbsp;on Mainboard on 19 July. The company runs one of the largest bar chain networks in the PRC.</li>

<p><em>* Adjusted EBITDA, NPAT and EPS exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring items that have less bearing on SGX Group&rsquo;s operating performance.

<p><em>All figures are for the year except for figures in brackets, which are for the year earlier unless otherwise stated. Figures&nbsp;may be subject to rounding.</em></p>
<p><em>The presentation of revenue has been revised in FY2024 to the following four operating segments &ndash; Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities; Equities &ndash; Cash; Equities &ndash; Derivatives; and Platform and Others. FY2023 revenue has been reclassified to the four operating segments for a like-for-like comparison against FY2024</em><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1"><em><span><sup>[1]</sup></span></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today reported FY2024 adjusted net profit of S$525.9 million, 4.5% higher from the previous year (S$503.2 million).&nbsp;Adjusted EBITDA was up at S$711.6 million (S$688.6 million), while adjusted earnings per share was 49.2 cents (47.1 cents).</p>
<p>Revenue increased 3.1% to S$1,231.7 million (S$1,194.4 million), mainly driven by higher revenues from Currencies and Commodities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;and Platform and Others, partially offset by lower Equities &ndash; Cash<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and Equities &ndash; Derivatives<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has proposed a final quarterly dividend of 9.0 cents (8.5 cents) per share, payable on 25 October 2024, for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. If approved, this represents an annualised increase of 5.9%.</p>
<p>Loh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, &ldquo;Our multi-asset strategy has yielded positive results over the years and will remain our core differentiator. Revenue growth in FY2024 was led by strong volumes in our currencies and commodities businesses as we expanded our customer base and drove higher activity. Our currencies and commodities franchises are on a healthy growth momentum with volumes doubling over the last three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our equities businesses showed stronger activity in the second half of the financial year, with equity derivatives daily average volume and securities daily average value increasing 11% and 21% half-on-half respectively. We are pushing ahead with our efforts to increase market participation, product development and adoption, as well as cross-border connectivity.&nbsp; At the same time, we will work closely with the Review Group set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore,&rdquo; added Mr. Loh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) segment has delivered more than 20% CAGR in the last three years<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn3">[3]</a>. Commodities daily average volume (DAV) grew 50% to about 240,000 contracts in FY2024, driven mainly by broadening participation in our iron ore futures contracts during the overnight T+1 session. Looking ahead, the next phase of growth for commodities will be anchored on synergies between our ferrous and freight offering.</p>
<p>Our OTC FX average daily volume well surpassed our target with a 47% increase to reach US$111 billion in FY2024, while our currency futures DAV grew 36% to about 204,000 contracts. Our OTC FX business is projected to contribute mid-to-high single digit percent of Group EBITDA in the medium term, compared to around 3% of Group EBITDA in FY2024.</p>
<p>In the medium term, we aim to grow Group revenue (excluding treasury income) between 6-8% CAGR. This will be driven mainly by low to mid-teens percentage growth in our OTC FX and exchange traded derivatives businesses. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage as group expense growth<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;is expected to be in the low to mid-single digit percentage CAGR in the medium term.</p>
<p><span>Results Summary</span></p>
<p><span>Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC)</span></p>
<p>FICC revenue increased 22.3% to S$322.5 million (S$263.6 million) and accounted for 26.2% (22.1%) of total revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$75.7 million, up 8.3% from S$69.9 million</li>
</ul>
<p>Trading and clearing revenue grew by S$52.9 million, mainly from increased volumes in commodity derivatives and OTC FX transactions<em>.</em></p>
<p>Commodity derivatives volumes increased&nbsp;50.2% to&nbsp;61.5 million contracts (41.0 million contracts), mainly due to higher volumes in iron ore derivatives.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Currency derivatives volumes increased 34.2% to 49.2 million contracts (36.7 million contracts), mainly due to higher volumes in USD/CNH FX futures contracts.<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTC FX headline average daily volume (ADV)&nbsp;increased 46.6% to US$111.1&nbsp;billion (US$75.8 billion) due to an increase in swaps activities.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Equities &ndash; Cash</span></p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Cash revenue&nbsp;declined by 2.1% to S$334.9 million (S$342.1 million) and accounted for&nbsp;27.2% (28.6%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue: S$137.1 million, up 1.0% from S$135.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>We recorded 7 (8) new equity listings which raised S$117.0 million (S$37.6 million). Secondary equity funds raised were S$1.2 billion (S$4.8 billion).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securities daily average traded value (SDAV) declined&nbsp;3.9% to S$1.06 billion (S$1.10 billion) and total securities traded value declined&nbsp;4.2% to S$263.7 billion (S$275.5 billion). This was made up of Cash Equities<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, where traded value decreased&nbsp;by 3.8% to S$253.2 billion (S$263.2 billion), and Other Products<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, where traded value&nbsp;decreased 13.9% to S$10.5 billion (S$12.2 billion).

<p>Overall average clearing fees remained comparable at 2.49 basis points (bps) (2.49 bps). Turnover velocity (primary-listed) was 37.5% (37.4%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in securities settlement, depository management, corporate actions and other revenue was mainly&nbsp;due to higher interest income from handling of corporate actions, partially offset by lower number of settlement instructions.</p>
<p><span>Equities &ndash; Derivatives&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Equities &ndash; Derivatives revenue declined&nbsp;7.5% to S$334.0 million (S$361.3 million) and accounted for&nbsp;27.1% (30.2%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Trading and clearing revenue: S$256.1 million, down&nbsp;9.0% from S$281.6 million</li>
<li>Treasury and other revenue: S$77.9 million, down&nbsp;2.2% from S$79.7 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The decline in trading and clearing revenue was driven by a&nbsp;7.7% decline in total equity derivatives volumes, mainly from declines in volumes of our GIFT Nifty,&nbsp;<a>FTSE China A50&nbsp;</a>and Nikkei 225 index futures contracts, partially offset by higher volumes of our FTSE Taiwan index futures contracts. Excluding Nifty, trading and clearing revenue increased 0.5%.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Average Fees</span></p>
<p>Average fee per contract for Equity, Currency and Commodity derivatives was 4.3% lower at S$1.54 (S$1.61) mainly driven by decline in average fee of our GIFT Nifty index futures contracts, due to the reclassification of NSE fee arrangement from expense to revenue as part of GIFT Connect. On a pro forma basis, FY2024 average fee per contract declined at a lower rate of 1.1% to S$1.54 (S$1.56).</p>
<p><span>Platform and Others&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Platform and Others revenue increased 5.6% to S$240.2 million (S$227.4 million) and accounted for&nbsp;19.5% (19.0%) of total revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>Market data revenue: S$47.9 million, up&nbsp;9.0% from S$44.0 million</li>
<li>Connectivity revenue: S$77.2 million, up&nbsp;9.0% from S$70.8 million</li>
<li>Indices and other revenue<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>: S$115.1 million, up&nbsp;2.2% from S$112.6 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The increase in Market data revenue was mainly driven by repricing and increase in number of data licence subscribers<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The increase in Connectivity revenue was mainly due to repricing and higher number of subscription of our co-location services.</p>
<p>Indices and other revenue increased mainly due to higher revenue contribution from Index Edge, Baltic Exchange and<em>&nbsp;</em>EMC, partially offset by decline in revenue from Scientific Beta.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Expenses Overview</span></p>
<p>Total expenses increased 3.4% to S$625.3 million (S$604.9 million), mainly from higher staff costs and one-time provision to fund initiatives targeted at improving the vibrancy of the Securities Market, offset by lower processing and royalties and professional fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusted total expenses increased 2.5% to S$604.0 million (S$589.3 million), excluding the one-time provision, amortisation of purchased intangible assets, and others.</p>
<p>We have been prudent in managing our cost base even as we invested for growth, particularly in the OTC FX business. Our Group expenses have grown in line with our medium-term guidance of mid-single digit percentage CAGR over the past three years.</p>
<p>We expect FY2025 expenses (excluding transaction-based expenses, i.e. processing and royalties) to grow 2-4% year-on-year. This will be achieved by measured pace of headcount growth, improving operational efficiency and realising savings from the completion of the migration of our OTC FX data centre.</p>
<p><span>Non-operating Items</span></p>
<p>Non-operating items were higher at S$117.1 million (S$99.8 million), driven largely by fair value gain from our investment in 7Ridge and higher net interest income, partially offset by higher impairment losses.</p>
<p><span>Capital Expenditure Overview</span></p>
<p>Total capital expenditure was S$66.0 million (S$59.4 million). These investments include modernisation of our technology infrastructure and consolidation of our office spaces.</p>
<p>FY2025 capital expenditure is expected to be S$70-75 million as we invest in the modernisation of our securities system and infrastructure upgrade. Beyond FY2025, capital expenditure is expected to further increase due to continued investments into the modernisation of our exchange trading and clearing platforms, and data centre. Over the next cycle, capital expenditure is anticipated to remain below the historical average of 7% of Group revenue.</p>

<p align="justify"><span>Webcast and Conference Call Information</span></p>
<p align="justify">Robinhood will host a conference call to discuss its results at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET today, August&nbsp;7, 2024. The live webcast of Robinhood's earnings conference call can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>, along with the earnings press release and accompanying slide presentation.</p>
<p align="justify">Following the call, a replay and transcript will also be available at the same website.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Financial Outlook</span></p>
<p align="justify">Our 2024 expense plan includes growth investments in new products, features, and international expansion while also getting more efficient in our existing businesses. Our outlook for both GAAP total operating expenses and Non-GAAP combined Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC for full-year 2024 is unchanged at $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion.</p>
<p align="justify">Actual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>

The above expense outlook does not include potential significant regulatory matters or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>
<p align="justify"><span><br />Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</span></p>
<p align="justify">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected financial performance of Robinhood Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;Robinhood,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and our strategic and operational plans, including (among others) statements regarding that with Robinhood Gold reaching 2 million subscribers, we&rsquo;re witnessing the flywheel accelerate; that we continue to focus on delivering another year of profitable growth; that management currently expects to execute a $1 billion share repurchase program over a two to three year period; that Robinhood will be hosting its first-ever customer-focused conference, happening October 16-18, 2024; and all statements and information under the headings &ldquo;Financial Outlook&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Outlook.&rdquo; Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;will&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;target,&rdquo; &ldquo;project,&rdquo; &ldquo;contemplate,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;predict,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential,&rdquo; or &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this press release. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our limited operating experience at our current scale; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of continued declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (&ldquo;PFOF&rdquo;), and the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations; the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and invest in new products, services, technologies, and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating AI technologies into some of our products and processes; the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes; the risk that our platforms and services could be exploited to facilitate illegal payments; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on August 8, 2024, as well as in our other filings with the SEC, all of which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">www.sec.gov</a>. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, August&nbsp;7, 2024 and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</span></p>
<p align="justify">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income (loss) and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo;), Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.</p>
<p align="justify">The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA Margin</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income (loss) divided by total net revenues). We believe Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. We believe Adjusted Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves and (ii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results, of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC. We believe Adjusted Operating Expense and SBC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our cost structure. Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Key Performance Metrics</span></p>
<p align="justify">In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Funded Customers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Assets Under Custody (&ldquo;AUC&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define AUC as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency and cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in AUC in any given period.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, and cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives and free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin interest, Gold subscription fees, and other assets transferred out of our platforms (assets transferred in or out include debit card transactions, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service transfers, and custodial crypto wallet transfers) for a stated period. Prior to the second quarter of 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from cash and assets earned in connection with Company promotions and prior to January 2024, Net Deposits did not include inflows from dividends and interest or outflows from Robinhood Gold subscription fees and margin interest, although we have not restated amounts in prior periods as the impact to those figures was immaterial.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Average Revenue Per User (&ldquo;ARPU&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this release represent ARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Gold Subscribers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Additional Operating Metrics</span></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Retirement AUC</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Retirement AUC as the total AUC in traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Cash Sweep</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Cash Sweep as the period-end aggregate balances in our brokerage sweep program (i.e., the period-end total amount of participating users&rsquo; uninvested brokerage cash that has been automatically &ldquo;swept&rdquo; or moved from their brokerage accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks). This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Margin Book</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts).</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Notional Trading Volume</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Notional Trading Volume for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class over a specified period of time.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Options Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Monthly Active Users ("MAU")</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define MAUs as the number of unique persons who, using one or more accounts with a Robinhood entity, meet one of the following criteria at any point during a specified calendar month: a) executes a debit card or credit card transaction, b) transitions between two different screens on a mobile device while logged into their account or c) loads a page in a web browser while logged into their account. A person need not satisfy these conditions on a recurring monthly basis or be a Funded Customer to be included in MAU. MAU figures in this release reflect MAU for the last month of the relevant period presented. We utilize MAU to measure how many customers interact with our products and services during a given month. MAU does not measure the frequency or duration of the interaction, but we consider it a useful indicator for engagement. Additionally, MAUs are positively correlated with, but are not indicative of, the performance of revenue and other key performance indicators.</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Glossary Terms</span></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Investment Accounts</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account or a funded individual retirement account ("IRA"). As of June 30, 2024, a Funded Customer can have up to three Investment Accounts - individual brokerage account, traditional IRA, and Roth IRA.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">When used with respect to Net Deposits, &ldquo;growth rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;annualized growth rate&rdquo; provide information about Net Deposits relative to total AUC. &ldquo;Growth rate&rdquo; is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12 month period, divided by AUC for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12 month period. &ldquo;Annualized growth rate&rdquo; is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by AUC for the immediately preceding quarter.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Results From Its First Fact Finding Exercise On Creditworthiness Assessment Practices Of Non-Bank Lenders</title>

<div> Report, creditworthiness assessment, non-bank lenders, EBA, consumer trends<br />
<br />
The EBA published a report on non-bank lenders' creditworthiness assessment practices, finding inadequate practices, lack of harmonization, and increased consumer credit. The EBA will continue monitoring NBL activities. <br /><br />Summary: The EBA report highlights inadequate creditworthiness assessment practices by non-bank lenders, lack of harmonization, increased consumer credit, and the need for ongoing monitoring. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the results of a fact finding exercise on the creditworthiness assessment (CWA) practices of non-bank lenders (NBLs). The exercise is a follow-up to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-identifies-fraud-retail-payments-and-over-indebtedness"><span>Consumer Trends Report</span></a><span>&nbsp;published in April 2023 and aimed at gaining insight into the extent to which NBLs contribute to over-indebtedness and arrears. The EBA finds that,&nbsp;while some NBLs might service segments of the population that may have limited opportunities to access traditional banks for credit, a significant number of the surveyed NBLs appear to apply inadequate practices for information gathering and verification during their CWAs.</span></p>
<p>The Report also finds that the lack of a harmonised definition of NBLs and a harmonised authorisation framework in the EU contribute to different types of NBLs being supervised in different ways across EU Member States. Consequently, different rules apply to entities that are of a similar kind across the EU.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Report finds that many National Competent Authorities have taken supervisory actions in respect of NBLs, but the surge in the number and significance of these entities increases the need for specialised resources dedicated to the monitoring of non-bank lending activities.</p>
<p>In terms of market trends, the Report shows that the proportion of credit granted under the Consumer Credit Directive by the surveyed NBLs between 2020 and 2023 overall increased, with a peak of 43% in 2021. In the same period, the proportion of loans granted under the Mortgage Credit Directive by the surveyed NBLs decreased from 58% to 45%.</p>
<p>The EBA will continue monitoring the activities of NBLs through its biennial Consumer Trends Report and may consider, depending on the findings and the need, initiating further ad hoc action to foster further protection of EU consumers.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>The EBA is mandated under Article 9 of its founding Regulation to, inter alia, collect, analyse, and report on consumer trends. To that end, the EBA publishes a biennial Consumer Trends Report, with several editions identifying indebtedness as one of the key issues that causes significant detriment to consumers in the EU, with the last edition indicating that NBLs and their CWA practices may play a significant role in contributing to this recurrent issue.</p>
<p>In order to gauge insight of the CWA practices applied by NBLs in respect to credit products falling under the Consumer Credit Directive and/or the Mortgage Credit Directive, the EBA carried out a fact finding exercise with National Competent Authorities that chose a sample of 125 NBLs from across the EU to include in the exercise, and using the reference period between 2020 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ittai Ben Zeev, TASE CEO, said today:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;TASE continues to show resilience and support the Israeli economy against the backdrop of the ongoing war. We continue to push forward with technological innovation, implementing advanced infrastructure and promoting collaborations in order to upgrade the market, remove barriers and enhance its global accessibility. Now more than ever we are resolved to continue developing the capital market, as part of our unwavering commitment to the Israeli economy, which is pivotal to our national strength.</p>
<p>As part of these efforts, we recently published, in cooperation with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, a call for public comments on the proposal to align the TASE trading week with the global standard; a strong positive response was received in favor of changing to a Monday-through-Friday trading week. We are confident that this strategic move that will make TASE more readily accessible for global investors and increase their involvement in the Israeli capital market, benefiting the Israeli economy in general and the local companies in particular. We are currently examining all the public comments received in order to reach the most fitting solution, both for international investors and for the Israeli capital market."</p>
<p><strong>Tel Aviv, August 7, 2024 -&nbsp;</strong>The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange Ltd. (TASE:&nbsp;<strong>TASE</strong>) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Trading volumes rose significantly in the first half of the year with growth in indices and solid issuance activity</strong></p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, in the midst of the war, the TA-125 index increased by 3.5%, compared to the 3.8% for the Dow Jones index and compared 14.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index. Equity price rises characterized most sectoral indices, with the TA-Retail index leading the list with a 13% increase, followed by the high-tech companies&rsquo; indices - TA-Technology and TA-Global Bluetech, with a 10% and 9% increase, respectively, compared to the concurrent 17% increase in the NASDAQ 100 index. The market cap of the equity market at the end of the first half of the year reached NIS 1,087 billion, a 3% increase over 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Trading volumes in the main trading channels increased significantly in the first half of the year compared to 2023.</strong></p>
<p>In the equity market, trading volumes were 8% higher than the average daily trading volume for all of 2023, and averaged NIS 2.1 billion a day.</p>
<p>The average daily trading volume of bonds reached NIS 4.5 billion in the first half of the year, 15% higher than the average daily trading volume in the year 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the increase in the trading volume of the government shekel bonds, which totaled NIS 2.3 billion, compared to an average of NIS 1.9 billion in the previous year. CPI-linked government bonds also showed stronger trading volumes, at an average daily volume of NIS 1 billion, 1% greater than the average daily trading volume in the full year 2023. The trading volume of corporate bonds averaged NIS 1.1 billion, 12% greater than the average daily trading volume in the previous year.</p>
<p>T-bills also recorded substantial trading volumes in the first half of the year, at a daily average of NIS 1.7 billion, 19% higher than the average daily trading volume in 2023.</p>
<p>Creations and redemptions of mutual funds reached an average daily volume of NIS 1.8 billion, 28% greater than the average daily volume in the year 2023. The market cap of the mutual funds at the end of the first half of the year reached NIS 375 billion, 14% greater than the market cap at the end of 2023, this as a result of acquisitions of mutual funds and the appreciation of the mutual funds&rsquo; assets on TASE.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, 3 companies completed an IPO on TASE, compared to only one company in 2023.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the ongoing war and the growing deficit, the Ministry of Finance continued to raise debt in the second quarter of the year. The total amount of debt raised by the Ministry of Finance in bond offerings in the first half of the year totaled NIS 124.4 billion, compared to NIS 76.7 billion in the second half of 2023. NIS 95.7 billion of said amount was raised on TASE.</p>
<p><strong>Continued implementation of the strategic plan - alignment with global standards and diversification of investment products</strong></p>
<p>TASE continues to implement the strategic plan, with significant emphasis on the enhancement of global activity, the alignment of standards and the removal of trading barriers in the interfaces with the international markets.</p>
<p>Further to a call for public comments, published by TASE in collaboration with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, regarding the proposed transition to trading on Fridays as well, in line with the global standard, TASE announces that the proposed move received a very positive response from local and international investors, with a majority supporting a transition to a Monday through Friday trading week. TASE is currently considering options for the implementation of this alignment that would optimally benefit the local capital market and the international investors.</p>
<p>TASE continues to work in cooperation with the various authorities and regulators. Thus, for example, in mid-July, the Ministerial Legislation Committee approved the Securitization Law, which will facilitate, for the first time in Israel, the execution of securitization transactions, in alignment with global practices. Once the legislation is passed by the Knesset, TASE hopes to implement it and open the market already in 2025. In addition, the Israel Securities Authority has recently approved the launch of new money market funds with fixed dates, offering the public access to predetermined yield, this alongside the existing money market funds, allowing for greater product diversity for the benefit of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TASE continues to actively encourage new brokers to enter the Israeli capital market - since the end of May, Altshuler Shaham Trade is active as a member on TASE and TASE Clearing House, bringing the number of TASE members up to 25, compared to 24 at the end of 2023.</p>
<p>In addition, TASE continues to expand and diversify the range of products and to invest, among others, in new exclusive indices, this as part of its strategy of developing and upgrading the market, especially with the public in mind. In June, for the first time, TASE launched new indices with Kesem, Israel&rsquo;s largest fund company. In mid-July, TASE announced the launch of 7 additional equity and bond indices, some of which are designated for further collaborations between TASE and the various product issuers.</p>
<p>In the derivatives market, at the beginning of June, TASE reduced the multipliers of options on the TA-35 index, the TA-Banks5 index and the TA-125 index, as well as those of the foreign exchange derivatives traded on TASE. Part of the sources that will derive from the reduction of the underlying assets&rsquo; multipliers will be allocated to the development of the market and the enhancement of liquidity in the derivatives&rsquo; market by way of a volume rebate program.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights of the results for the second quarter and the first half of 2024:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revenue in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 105.1 million, compared to revenue of NIS 92.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 13%. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees. The most significant revenue item - trading and clearing commissions - totaled NIS 38.8 million in the second quarter of the year, compared to NIS 35.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year. 15% of the increase in revenue from trading and clearing commissions is due to an increase in the trading volumes and in the volume of creations/redemptions of mutual fund units. In opposition, a reduction in the effective commission rate in revenue from mutual funds and T-bills reduced the aforesaid increase in revenue by 4%, and there being one less trading day in the current quarter reduced revenue by an additional 2%.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 74.8 million, compared to costs of NIS 72.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 3% increase. The higher costs are due mainly to the increase in payroll expenses and technological investments and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 2 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 3.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, a 45% decrease. Financing income in the quarter increased due to interest income on the deposits. At the same time, financing expenses also increased as a result of a bank loan obtained at the end of 2023, resulting in reduced net financing income.</p>
<p><strong>Tax expenses, net in the second quarter of 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 8 million, compared to NIS 5.2 million in the corresponding quarter last year. The increase in the tax expense stemmed from the higher pre-tax profit. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to losses on securities in previous years for which deferred taxes were not created.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 24.3 million, compared to NIS 18.8 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%. The increase in profit was due mainly to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 45.8 million, compared to NIS 35.6 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 29%. Most of the increase is due to the NIS 10 million increase in profit before financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the second quarter of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 25.7 million, compared to NIS 20.4 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 26%. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights of the results for the first half of 2024:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Revenue in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 213.4 million, compared to revenue of NIS 192.9 million in the corresponding period last year, an 11% increase. The increase in revenue is due mainly to an increase in revenue from data distribution and connectivity services, as a result of the increased volume of activity and the impact of the updated index-usage fees.</p>
<p><strong>Costs in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 150.1 million, compared to costs of NIS 142.6 million in the corresponding period last year, a 5% increase. The higher costs are due mainly to the increase in payroll expenses and technological investments and in computer and communication expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Net financing income in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 3.4 million, compared to net financing income of NIS 6.1 million in the corresponding period last year, a 44% decrease. Financing income in the period increased due to interest income on the deposits. At the same time, financing expenses also increased as a result of a bank loan obtained at the end of 2023, resulting in reduced net financing income.</p>
<p><strong>Net tax expense in the first half of 2024</strong>&nbsp;totaled NIS 16.7 million, compared to NIS 12.2 million in the corresponding period last year, a 37% increase. The increase in the tax expense stemmed from the higher pre-tax profit. The increase in the effective tax rate is due to losses on securities in previous years for which deferred taxes were not created.</p>
<p><strong>The profit in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 50 million, compared to NIS 44.3 million in the corresponding period last year, a 13% increase. Most of the increase in profit was due to the increase in revenue, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 94.4 million, compared to NIS 79.1 million in the corresponding period last year, a 19% increase. The increase is due to an increase of NIS 12.9 million in profit before financing, eliminating share-based payment expenses and depreciation expenses in an amount of NIS 2.4 million.</p>
<p><strong>The adjusted profit in the first half of 2024&nbsp;</strong>totaled NIS 53.5 million, compared to NIS 46.5 million in the corresponding period last year, a 15% increase. Most of the increase is due to an increase in revenue from services, less the increase in costs and in tax expenses and the adjustment of the increase in costs with respect to share-based payments.</p>

<title>ESAs’ Joint Board Of Appeal Dismisses Appeal By Euroins Insurance Group AD Against The European Insurance And Occupational Pensions Authority</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> unanimously, inadmissible, appeal, investigation, decision
Summary: The Board unanimously found Euroins' appeal inadmissible, stating that EIOPA's power to investigate is discretionary and not subject to review. The publication of the decision was postponed. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="node__content">
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Joint Board of Appeal (&ldquo;The Board&rdquo;) of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the EBA, ESMA, EIOPA), unanimously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-08/BoA_-_Euroins_v_EIOPA_-_combined_decision_and_orders.pdf">decided&nbsp;</a>that the appeal brought by Euroins Insurance Group AD (&ldquo;Euroins&rdquo;) against the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is inadmissible.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The appeal was brought in relation to the EIOPA Chairperson&rsquo;s decision not to start an investigation into an alleged breach or non-application of Union law regarding the withdrawal of the license of a subsidiary insurance undertaking of Euroins by the national competent authority in Romania.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">In its decision, the Board finds that EIOPA&rsquo;s power to initiate an investigation is of an entirely discretionary nature. Furthermore, the Board also asserts that the EIOPA Chairperson&rsquo;s decision to initiate an investigation is not subject to the Board&rsquo;s review. Finally, the decision clarifies that the Board does not have the power to order EIOPA to re-assess an appellant&rsquo;s request to open an investigation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Following the adoption of the decision, two orders on its publication were also adopted. The first order dismissed Euroins&rsquo; request not to publish the decision and its request for redaction. Yet, it agreed to delay publication to a date allowing Euroins to file an appeal against that order the General Court. The second order came upon request from the President of the Court of First Instance, seeking to grant additional time to analyse the case and consider interim measures requested by Euroins. That second order postponed the publication of the decision until 7 August 2024.</p>

<div> MoU, supervision, financial market infrastructure, coordination, regulatory sandboxes
Summary:
The Bank of England and FCA co-operate to supervise financial market infrastructure, with an effective MoU and plans for updates and new areas of coordination. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<h4>Statement</h4>
<div class="content-block">
<div class="page-content page-carousel sc-undefined" id="content">
<div id="output">
<p>The Bank of England (Bank) co-operates with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (&lsquo;The Authorities&rsquo;), to supervise financial market infrastructure (FMI).</p>
<p>A memorandum of understanding (MoU)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/august/boe-and-fca-mou-on-supervision-of-financial-market-infrastructures#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;facilitates effective supervision and policy making by the authorities. The MoU allows for the exchange of information between the authorities and promotes efficiency by minimising duplication of regulatory activities regarding FMIs. The MoU must be reviewed annually<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/august/boe-and-fca-mou-on-supervision-of-financial-market-infrastructures#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;to ensure it is proving effective. This involves requesting feedback from supervised FMIs on whether the proposed co-operation is working effectively.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA held a consultation with FMIs: Central Counterparties (CCPs), Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) and Recognised Central Securities Depositories (RCSDs) based on these firms&rsquo; interaction in 2023.</p>
<p>Respondents agreed that the arrangements of the MoU are proving to be effective and emphasised the importance of close and effective coordination between the authorities. They acknowledged the efforts made on coordination and agree that the Bank and FCA remain committed to effective co-operation. One noted feedback submitted last year had been acted upon. Respondents also highlighted increased communication and coordination between the respective supervisory teams relating to topics such as operational resilience.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA agree that the arrangements of the MoU regarding co-operation continue to be effective with appropriate coordination and no material duplication between them. The Bank and FCA will seek to address any specific areas identified by firms, including the need for collaboration in relation to new rulemaking powers.</p>
<p>The MoU will be updated in 2024 to reflect changes related to the Financial Services Markets Act (2023), as well as new areas requiring coordination, including regulatory sandboxes, in which innovations can be safely tested, and policy initiatives.</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA are also agreeing a separate MoU setting out how they intend to co-operate with each other in relation to the operation and supervision of the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS). This DSS MoU will be published before supervision in the DSS commences.</p>

<div> Options, VIX futures, Cboe, trading, volatility
<br />
Cboe plans to launch options on VIX futures, addressing global demand for hedging tools. Options will complement existing VIX Index options. Users can hedge positions using front-month VIX futures and standard VIX Index options.
<br /><br />Summary: Cboe announced plans to launch options on VIX futures, expanding its VIX complex to address global demand for hedging tools. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>New options planned to be listed on front-month Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures</li>
<li>Options-on-future structure designed to offer new way to manage market volatility</li>
<li>Expansion of VIX complex aims to address global demand for hedging tools</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch options on Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures. The new options on VIX futures (VX) are expected to begin trading on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) on October 14, subject to regulatory review.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Cboe currently offers securities-based VIX Index options, which allow investors to manage or gain exposure to broad U.S. equity market volatility. &nbsp;The new options on VIX futures will provide similar utility but are based on front-month VIX futures. &nbsp;With futures as the underlying asset, these options will be CFTC-regulated, enabling a wide array of market participants that are restricted from accessing U.S. securities-based options to use this product to express their views on equity market volatility.</p>
<p>"As the pioneer in volatility trading, Cboe continues to expand its VIX complex with additional products and services targeted at helping market participants better manage portfolio risk and trade volatility," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Given the increased trading activity we're seeing in VIX options and the strong demand for hedging tools this year, we're especially excited to expand our volatility toolkit to include these new options on VIX futures and our planned relaunch of variance futures coming in late September. With the U.S. election quickly approaching, which has historically been a meaningful volatility catalyst for markets, we expect these tools will help meet customer demand to effectively manage risk."</p>
<p>"We expect options on VIX futures will complement our existing product suite, appealing to a broad group of users, including Commodity Trading Advisors, customers of Futures Commission Merchants, and market participants currently active in VIX exchange-traded products and in Cboe's SPX option and VIX product ecosystems," said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe. "By listing these options on Cboe's U.S. futures exchange, CFE's global network of FCMs and brokers can trade them using the same connections and memberships already established for trading VIX futures, thereby enhancing ease and accessibility."</p>
<p>Options on VIX futures will be European-style (can only be exercised at expiration) and will physically settle into front-month VIX futures. The new options are expected to complement the existing VIX Index options, providing customers with more choice in expiration dates and enabling more granular hedging strategies. Users of options on VIX futures may be able to hedge those positions using front-month VIX futures and standard VIX Index options.</p>
<p>The new options on VIX futures will be exclusively listed and traded on CFE, joining other prominent volatility products, such as Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures and the planned launches of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures and Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX) futures, subject to regulatory review.

<title>DTCC’s Insurance &amp; Retirement Services Launch Standardized “Can-Sell” API Messaging Application - Producer Authorization Provides NSCC Members The Capability To Confirm The Credentials Of Producers Instantaneously By Moving Straight From Distributor To Carrier</title>

<div> DTCC, Insurance & Retirement Services, Producer Authorization, real-time, standardized<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches PAR service, verifying producers' authorization in real-time, streamlining processes, leveraging ACORD NGDS, offering increased standardization. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of DTCC&rsquo;s Insurance &amp; Retirement Services&rsquo; (I&amp;RS) Producer Authorization (PAR) service, a standardized method for insurance vendors and distributors to communicate with carriers to verify producers' authorization that is mandatory to sell insurance products. PAR deploys synchronous messages, allowing distributors and vendors to ping carriers instantly to certify producer credentials, streamlining processes and increasing operational efficiencies.</p>
<p>Today, financial advisors are required by regulation to be properly licensed, appointed and trained to solicit and sell insurance products. PAR helps to standardize and automate this process by enabling distributors to properly validate producers&rsquo; credentials and qualifications in real time in order to understand whether individuals are permissioned to sell certain products in specific jurisdictions. This eliminates the need for firms to adopt and manage multiple proprietary processes and provides producers with the ability to proactively take corrective actions and lower Not in Good Order application submissions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an industry need for a unified service, that provides real-time producer data, and we are pleased to now offer PAR,&rdquo; said Justin Schwartz, Executive Director, Product Management for Wealth Management Services at DTCC. &ldquo;In the development of the offering, we focused on building out a standardized &lsquo;can sell&rsquo; API message platform that improves client and advisor experience by providing increased confidence in authorized producers. We look forward to continuing to enhance our services to best meet the evolving needs of our clients and the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PAR leverages the ACORD Next-Generation Digital Standards (NGDS) UC-251 &ldquo;Verify Producer Can Sell Annuities&rdquo; User Story, providing enhanced licensing, appointments and training credentials that permits distributors to submit carrier message requests while simultaneously allowing carriers to determine if producers are authorized to advance new business applications. PAR can be utilized at any point during the solicitation/sales process, and the message statuses are readily available via API.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a need for a new insurance industry standard around real-time authorizations. This innovative solution has facilitated increased standardization in our messaging capabilities by streamlining processes which allows us to confirm a producers&rsquo; ability to sell a product for multiple carriers by accessing a single data point. We are excited to offer this service to our partners,&rdquo; said Doug Massey, EVP Sales at Hexure.</p>

<br />
H2O breached FCA regulations, failed due diligence on high-risk investments, did not declare conflicts of interest, provided false information, pays €250 million to affected investors.
<br /><br />Summary: H2O failed to comply with FCA regulations, resulting in a €250 million payment to affected investors. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Asset manager H2O AM LLP (H2O) will pay &euro;250 million to investors unable to access their funds since 2020, following an investigation by the FCA.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>Between April 2015 and November 2019, H2O failed to carry out proper due diligence on investments relating to the Tennor Group of companies owned by Lars Windhorst, or other companies he introduced.</span></p>
<p><span>The investments were high risk and hard to sell.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA also found that H2O did not have adequate policies or procedures or exercise due skill and care in managing potential conflicts of interest. The FCA identified over 50 instances where hospitality had been received by H2O employees but was not properly declared, including the use of a superyacht and private jet.</span></p>
<p><span>H2O also provided false and misleading statements and documentation to the regulator, such as fabricated records and minutes of meetings.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA would have imposed a substantial fine on H2O for its serious breaches. However, the FCA has agreed the firm will make &euro;250 million available to all those whose investments remain trapped. A significant part of this sum has been made available by way of voluntary contribution from the H2O Group. H2O has waived its rights to fees and investments totalling &euro;320 million and will apply to cancel its UK authorisation by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'H2O&rsquo;s job was to manage its funds properly and protect investors. It failed to do this and, to make matters worse, it repeatedly provided misleading information to the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>'Through this settlement the FCA has secured money for affected investors and agreement that H2O will stop operating regulated business in the UK.'</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read the FCA's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/h2o-am-llp-2024.pdf" title="h2o-am-llp-2024.pdf">Final Notice for H2O AM LLP</a>.</li>
<li>The French financial services regulator the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) is the designated regulator in respect of the collective investments, which H2O managed on a cross-border basis pursuant to the UCITS Directive, and the FCA is the designated regulator of H2O.</li>
<li>Were it not for the payment of &euro;250 million to affected investors and the fact that the AMF has previously issued a penalty on H2O (currently subject to appeal) in relation to the same investments, the FCA would have issued H2O with a penalty.</li>
<li>The FCA investigation found that H2O breached Principle 2 (skill, care and diligence), Principle 3 (management and control) and Principle 11 (relations with regulators) of its principles for business.</li>

<div> upgrades, latencies, Europe, Asia, trading
<br />
Avelacom has upgraded its core network to reduce latencies between European and East Asian trading hubs, providing faster connectivity for algorithmic trading strategies.
<br /><br />Summary: Avelacom upgrades network to reduce latencies between Europe and Asia, supporting increased trading volumes with faster connectivity. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Avelacom&rsquo;s core network has recently undergone significant upgrades, optimizing its terrestrial path latencies by up to 8 milliseconds.</span> </li>
<li><span>This benefits key routes between Europe&rsquo;s hubs (London, Frankfurt, Dublin, Zurich) and major East Asian hubs (Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong).</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Avelacom has reduced network latencies between European markets and major East Asian cities Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.&nbsp;</span><span>For example, the latency for the London &lt;&gt; Shanghai route is now less than 125 milliseconds (round-trip delay), compared to the previous industry benchmark of approximately 133 milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span>These unmatched speeds were achieved through network upgrades that were completed using cutting-edge technologies on these long-distance and complex routes, which travel through multiple countries.</span></p>
<p><span>Europe to East Asia routes are growing in demand, driven by increased FX and crypto electronic trading volumes, as well as increased participation from institutional traders. London is the world&rsquo;s largest currency trading hub, while Tokyo hosts tier 1 crypto venues, is a global price discovery hub for digital assets, as well as being a top tier FX trading destination. The improvement in network infrastructure achieved by Avelacom&rsquo;s upgrades supports this growth in trading volumes by providing faster connectivity that is pivotal for algorithmic strategies dominating the market. Routes into and out of Seoul, Korea will be the next to be upgraded</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Aleksey Larichev, CEO of Avelacom</span></strong><span>, states: &ldquo;Fast is never done because we serve global banks and prop trading firms that deploy sophisticated market-making and arbitrage strategies. We&rsquo;ve built our reputation by introducing unique, proprietary, and fastest connectivity options, tailored for the financial industry. Constantly updating network latencies is a significant part of our overall business success&rdquo;.</span></p>

<title>SET Market  Report For July 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-july-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Federal Reserve, interest rate, market turbulence, Thai shares, economic recovery
<br /><br />Summary: The Federal Reserve kept interest rate unchanged, market turbulence caused sell-off, Thai shares saw slower foreign selling, Thai economic recovery gaining speed, TFEX trading volume declined. <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve (Fed) kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5.25-5.50 percent for the eighth consecutive meeting in July, as widely expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the US central bank will pivot in September&rsquo;s meeting. However, weak job reports in July, released after Fed&rsquo;s July meeting, led the market to perceive that September&rsquo;s potential rate cut could be a slow-footed response from the Fed. This triggered a global stock market sell-off led by Wall Street and Japan. Amid the market turbulence, investors are recommended to accumulate stocks with appropriate valuation and limited exposure to the potential impacts of recession. Signs of capital inflows to the regional stock market have emerged.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that foreign investors were still net sellers of Thai shares in July but at a slower pace as the Thai baht strengthened against the greenback throughout the month. The firmer baht was primarily driven by the overall appreciation of Asian currencies, led by the Japanese yen, and bolstered by rising global gold prices amid heightened geopolitical risks. Foreign investors' net buying of Thai bonds also strengthened the baht. The Thai economic recovery is gaining speed, underpinned by exports, tourism, and higher government spending. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)&rsquo;s tightened measures on short selling have effectively curbed such activities, encouraging more domestic investment and counterbalancing foreign investment trends. Moreover, the Thai government approved more attractive tax benefits for investment in Thai ESG funds including an increase in tax-deductible amount and a shorter lock-up period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for July</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of July 2024, SET Index rose 1.5 percent from the previous month but fell 6.7 percent from the end of 2023 to close at 1,320.86 points. Investors are awaiting a clearer picture of the government&rsquo;s economic stimulus measures and assessing the impact of market confidence-boosting measures implemented in July 2024. </li>
<li>For the seven months to July, industry groups that outpaced SET Index were Technology, Agro &amp; Food Industry, Consumer Products and Services.</li>

<div> - ASIC, legislative instruments, consultation, feedback, record-keeping obligations
Summary:
ASIC proposes extension of 3 legislative instruments for 5 years, invites feedback on their effectiveness, and outlines background on the instruments. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>ASIC proposes to extend the operation of three legislative instruments for a further five years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Order [<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/current/F2014L01237">CO 14/923</a>]&nbsp;<em>Record-keeping obligations for Australian financial services licensees when giving personal advice</em>,</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/current/F2021L01128">ASIC Corporations and Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Reportable Situations) Instrument 2021/716</a></em>, and&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/current/F2021L01364"><em>ASIC Credit (Breach Reporting&mdash;Prescribed Commonwealth Legislation) Instrument 2021/801</em></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC has assessed that these instruments, which are due to expire in October 2024, are operating efficiently and effectively, and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.</p>
<p>In extending operation of the instruments, ASIC will convert [CO 14/923] to the legislative instrument format and consolidate the relief in ASIC Instruments 2021/716 and 2021/801 into one instrument.</p>
<p><em>A consultation paper was not issued for this consultation.</em></p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>ASIC invites feedback on our proposal, including whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>the instruments are operating effectively and efficiently, and/or</li>
<li>whether any amendments are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders should send their submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by 5pm on 4 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders may choose to remain anonymous or use an alias when providing feedback. However, ASIC will not be able to contact stakeholders to discuss their feedback if it was submitted it in this manner.</p>
<p>Please note stakeholder feedback will not be treated as confidential unless stakeholders specifically request that we treat whole or part of it (such as any personal or financial information) as confidential.</p>
<p>Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/dealing-with-asic/privacy/asic-privacy-policy-complete/" title="ASIC Privacy Policy - complete">ASIC&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>&nbsp;for more information about how we handle personal information, rights to seek access to and correct personal information, and the right to complain about breaches of privacy by ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>[<a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/current/F2014L01237">CO 14/923</a>] modifies the Corporations Act to insert a new section 912G that imposes specific record-keeping requirements when AFS licensees or their representatives (including advice providers) give personal advice to retail clients.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01128/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/716</a>&nbsp;modifies the Corporations Act to exclude certain forms of non-compliance from being deemed &lsquo;significant&rsquo; breaches of core obligations, about which AFS licensees and credit licensees must lodge breach reports under the Corporations Act. The instrument also extends the period in which AFS licensees and credit licensees may report certain breaches that relate to an earlier reported breach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2021L01364/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2021/801</a>&nbsp;modifies the law to specify the other Commonwealth legislation that is a core obligation for the purposes of the National Credit Act. Credit licensees must report significant breaches of core obligations under the National Credit Act.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators And Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Expect Crypto Trading Platforms To Prioritize Applications For Investment Dealer Registration And CIRO Membership</title>

<div> Securities, Crypto trading platforms, Investment dealers, CIRO membership, Canadian securities law
<br />
CTPs in Canada must comply with securities laws, aim for registration as investment dealers, and CIRO membership. Investors should exercise caution when investing in crypto assets.
<br /><br />Summary: CTPs in Canada must comply with securities laws, aim for registration as investment dealers, and CIRO membership. Investors should exercise caution when investing in crypto assets. <div>
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) are reminding crypto trading platforms (CTPs) to ensure their operations comply with Canadian securities laws by prioritizing their applications for registration as investment dealers and membership with CIRO.</p>
<p>On March 29, 2021, the CSA and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (now CIRO) published<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2021/03/5952456-_-CSA-IIROC-Notice-21-329.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;Staff Notice 21-329&nbsp;<em>Guidance for Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms: Compliance with Regulatory Requirements</em></a>, providing guidance on the securities law requirements that apply to CTPs.</p>
<p>In Canada, CTPs that facilitate trading in either a) crypto assets that are securities and/or derivatives or b) instruments or contracts, based on crypto assets, that are securities or derivatives, are expected to register as investment dealers and become members of CIRO, the regulatory body intended to oversee this type of activity.</p>
<p>As outlined in the staff notice, the CSA contemplated an interim approach, which allowed CTPs to operate as restricted dealers in an appropriately regulated environment for a time-limited period while working toward obtaining CIRO membership. CSA members expected CTPs to actively and diligently seek registration as investment dealers and membership with CIRO by the end of the time-limited period, which was generally expected to be two years.</p>
<p>Given the time that has passed, CSA members expect CTPs to have carefully reviewed and understood the requirements to become investment dealers and CIRO members, and be actively engaged with CIRO on their applications. Moving forward, CSA members do not intend to continue with the interim approach for time-limited restricted dealer registration for CTPs as described in the staff notice.</p>
<p>CTPs that have been working actively and diligently with CSA members to complete their registration should contact the CSA member that is their principal regulator to discuss whether time-limited registration as a restricted dealer is appropriate for the CTP.</p>
<p><strong>Applying for CIRO membership</strong></p>
<p>CIRO is committed to ensuring an efficient and thorough process to review CTPs&rsquo; applications for membership with CIRO. Guidance on applying for CIRO membership is available on CIRO.ca under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/becoming-dealer-member" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Becoming a Dealer Member</a>&nbsp;section. CTPs are encouraged to complete a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/176/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Readiness Questionnaire</a>&nbsp;to self-assess if they have the necessary infrastructure and capital in place to apply for membership.</p>
<p>CTPs must submit a completed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/191/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Membership Application Form</a>&nbsp;and all supporting materials to apply for CIRO membership. All membership applications undergo an extensive review by CIRO staff. Once satisfied that the CTP can comply with CIRO By-laws and Rules, CIRO staff will forward their recommendation to CIRO&rsquo;s Board of Directors for decision.</p>
<p>CIRO staff work closely with firms applying for membership and encourage applicants to contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MemberIntake@ciro.ca">MemberIntake@ciro.ca</a>&nbsp;to arrange for a pre-filing discussion with the CIRO team dedicated to managing membership applications and transactions.</p>
<p>We encourage all CTPs to consult their legal counsel about Canadian securities law and CIRO rules, and to contact their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principal regulator</a>&nbsp;or CIRO staff with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Investors interested in crypto assets</strong></p>
<p>Investing in crypto assets can be high risk. Before choosing to buy or sell crypto assets, the CSA urges investors to consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of CTPs</a>&nbsp;that are authorized to do business with Canadians.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) is the national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers, mutual fund dealers and trading activity on Canada&rsquo;s debt and equity marketplaces. CIRO is committed to the protection of investors, providing efficient and consistent regulation, and building Canadians&rsquo; trust in financial regulation and the people managing their investments. For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.ciro.ca</a>.</p>
<p>For investor inquiries, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact your local securities regulator</a>.</p>

<title>ACER Confirms That The Danish Emergency Gas Supply Tariffs Comply With The EU Network Code</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> methodology, compliance, non-protected consumers, emergency supply services, cost allocation
Summary:<br />ACER finds Danish emergency supply tariffs compliant but lacking transparency. Ex-ante tariff doesn't consider supply risks; ex-post compensation adjusts for actual interruptions. Recommended more detailed information. <div>
<p>Today, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTBVUGAldXUEwLAgZVHVZfVwQdU10GUxoFA1ZVVgNWAFUGUwIdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;on the Danish non-transmission tariffs proposed by Energinet, Denmark&rsquo;s Transmission System Operator (TSO). These tariffs cover the costs of Denmark&rsquo;s emergency supply services, such as filling gas storage and providing emergency gas supply to non-protected consumers.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCBFIHU1QAUkxbUlAAHVYPBVQdUw5UVxoMB1VRDFAFUwVXBgYdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposed methodology</a>&nbsp;includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ex-ante tariff, calculated using a postage stamp reference price methodology (RPM), which distributes emergency service costs equally among all non-protected consumers.</li>
<li>An ex-post compensation, which adjusts cost allocation after gas is delivered based on the actual gas volumes received by each non-protected consumer during an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings?</span></p>
<p>ACER evaluated the compliance of the proposed methodology with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdAAABVQ4EDQEdWl0GUh0GC1dXGldQC1IZBARTAVdQUwdWBVtRRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>) and notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ex-ante postage stamp tariff does not consider the varying risks of supply interruption among different non-protected customers.</li>
<li>Non-protected consumers receive equal protection for the first 72 hours after emergency measures begin. After this period, the risk of gas supply interruptions may depend on the remaining gas volumes.</li>
<li>Designing a cost-reflective ex-ante tariff is highly challenging due to information confidentiality and the uncertainty of supply emergencies.</li>
<li>In the event of a supply emergency, the ex-post compensation increases cost reflectivity by adjusting the initial tariff to reflect the actual level of interruption for each non-protected customer.</li>
<li>The consultation document lacks sufficient information on the functioning of the ex-post compensation mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACER concludes that the proposed non-transmission tariffs comply with the NC TAR and recommends the Danish regulatory authority to ensure greater transparency by providing more detailed information on the ex-post compensation mechanism in their next decision.</p>

<p>Bitcoin rebounded today, joined by significant gains in other cryptocurrencies, as concerns over interest rates continued to fuel market volatility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin has bounced back today as we see the wider cryptocurrency market back in the green." said Arthur Firstov, Chief Business Officer at Mercuryo, a leading payment infrastructure provider in the digital token space. "Nevertheless, a mood of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has now engulfed the digital token space. The still nascent asset class is at the mercy of the gyrations of global financial markets. The actions of the US&rsquo;s Federal Reserve &ndash; and whether it has been behind the curve on rate cuts &ndash; remain front and centre in the minds of traders. Cryptocurrency markets are likely to remain highly volatile amid frenetic trading in the days to come.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Improves Despite Financial Performance Concerns</title>

<div> improved, farmer sentiment, concerns, financial performance, farmland values
Summary:<br /><br />The farmer sentiment improved in July, with concerns about high input costs and lower crop prices. However, financial performance declined, impacting farmland value expectations. <div>
<p>Three broad-based measures of farmer sentiment improved in July as the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=2170705440&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;index rose 8 points to 113, the Index of Current Conditions increased by 10 points to 100, and the Index of Future Expectations at 119 was 7 points higher than a month earlier. Despite declines in corn and soybean prices from mid-June to mid-July &mdash; Eastern Corn Belt cash prices fell 11% and 5%, respectively &mdash; farmer sentiment improved in July. Responses to the individual questions attribute this positive shift to fewer respondents reporting worsened conditions compared to a year ago and a decrease in those expecting negative future outcomes. This month's Ag Economy Barometer survey was conducted from&nbsp;July 15-19, 2024.</p>
<p>The July survey showed that high input costs remained the biggest concern for 34% of farmers. Additionally, the risk of lower crop and livestock prices continues to worry producers, with 29% citing it as a top concern, up from 25% in June. Reflecting the signals from the&nbsp;Federal Reserve&nbsp;that interest rates have peaked, only 17% of respondents cited rising interest rates as a top concern, down from 23% last month.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 4 points in July to 81, 6 points lower than in&nbsp;July 2023. The decline in financial performance expectations reflected farmers' worries about weakening commodity prices and high input costs following improvements in the May and June indices. Although production costs for principal crops, including corn and soybeans, have decreased year over year, output prices have also fallen, raising the possibility of a cost-price squeeze for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;crop producers.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about farms' financial performance, the Farm Capital Investment Index rose 6 points in July to 38, though it remains weak, at 7 points lower than in&nbsp;July 2023. This improvement was due to a slight decrease in the number of producers who believe it's a bad time to make large investments, which dropped from 80% in June to 75% in July.</p>
<p>"Declines in crop prices point to lower producer incomes this year, so the increase in optimism was somewhat puzzling,"&nbsp;said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=1415570011&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4226534-1&amp;h=360616614&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "Fewer producers citing rising interest rates as a primary concern for the upcoming year corresponds with the modest improvement in their perspectives on capital investments, but respondents continue to express hesitancy to make large investments."</p>
<p>July saw a small improvement in the Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index, rising to 118 from 115 in June. This was driven by more respondents expecting stable farmland values over the next year. At the same time, the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped 6 points from June to 146, with fewer farmers expecting values to rise over the next five years and more anticipating they will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>As nationwide discussions begin for the 2025 crop year's farmland leases, the July survey revealed that nearly three-fourths (72%) of crop farmer respondents expect cash rental rates to remain roughly the same as in 2024. Among the remaining respondents, views were nearly evenly divided, with 15% anticipating a rise in rates and 13% expecting a decline.</p>

<div> ICE, Two Harbors, Encompass, digital mortgage platform, direct-to-consumer recapture originations channel
Summary:<br />ICE's Encompass platform selected by Two Harbors for direct-to-consumer mortgage originations, providing streamlined workflows and borrower experience, part of ICE's full mortgage technology ecosystem. <div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Intercontinental Exchange</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>, Inc.</span>&nbsp;</a>(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that Two Harbors Investment Corp.(NYSE:TWO) (&ldquo;Two Harbors&rdquo;), an MSR + Agency RMBS real estate investment trust, has selected the Encompass&nbsp;<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;digital mortgage platform to support their new direct-to-consumer recapture originations channel. Part of ICE&rsquo;s end-to-end digital housing finance ecosystem, Encompass is the mortgage industry&rsquo;s leading digital platform for lenders to originate, service, sell and purchase loans faster &ndash; all from a single system of record.</p>
<p>Since acquiring RoundPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC (&ldquo;RoundPoint&rdquo;) in 2023, Two Harbors has become the eighth largest servicer of conventional loans in the country. The decision to expand into mortgage loan originations is key to their strategy of retaining servicing customers when interest rates drop and borrowers begin to refinance their loans. After a thorough search, Two Harbors identified Encompass as their platform partner in their effort to build out a direct-to-consumer channel to streamline origination workflows and provide an exceptional borrower experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The built-in configurability and smooth implementation process with ICE meant that we were able to begin offering loans to our customers at RoundPoint within several months of our decision to go with Encompass,&rdquo; said Bill Greenberg, Two Harbors&rsquo; President and CEO. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to continue to take advantage of the additional capabilities and greater efficiencies within the integrated ICE technology ecosystem. When we consider the scope of what we can achieve together, the possibilities are exciting and will be beneficial to our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encompass is key to the ICE end-to-end mortgage technology ecosystem, which is digitizing the entire real estate and housing finance lifecycle to create a better experience for lenders, homeowners, and investors. ICE is committed to investing in new innovations that help companies drive operational efficiencies across their entire business with visibility and control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud that Two Harbors chose the Encompass digital lending platform as they strategically expand their mortgage offerings.&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s technology will help them better meet the needs of borrowers in this continuously evolving market. Two Harbors has been able to quickly deliver for their customers &ndash; a testament to our ongoing commitment to innovation that both helps mortgage companies operate more efficiently and delivers a better experience to the American homeowner.&rdquo;</p>

<div> electronic marketplaces, trading volume, government bond, credit derivatives, repo<br />
<br />Summary:
Tradeweb reported a significant increase in trading volumes across various asset classes, including government bonds, credit derivatives, and repo in July 2024. <div>
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of July 2024 of $40.5 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-july-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$40.5-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.82-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $1.82tn, an increase of 43.5 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<p>In July 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share of fully electronic U.S. high yield TRACE</li>
<li>ADV in global repurchase agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2024 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<h5>RATES  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 47.4% YoY to $206.1 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 16.5% YoY to $42.9bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond volumes were supported by growth across all client sectors. Increased adoption across a range of protocols and favorable market conditions contributed to the increase in volume. The addition of r8fin continues to contribute positively to wholesale volumes. Strong double-digit YoY growth in European government bonds and UK Gilts was supported by sustained volatility on the back of key political elections in Europe and the UK earlier in July, as well as a continued active primary market during the first half of the month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 17.6% YoY to $196.8bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Record July To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was driven by robust roll trading activity and significant participation from fast-money accounts. Specified pool trading volumes were up YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 38.9% YoY to $351.5bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 85.7% YoY to $671.4bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong volume in swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was driven by ongoing institutional client activity, strong tailwinds from global political uncertainties and a 23% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Central banks continued to contribute to increased volatility due to active discussions on rate movements. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for risk transfers especially in inflation swaps and non-G3 currencies. Emerging markets swap growth remained strong. July compression activity was lower than 2Q24.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>CREDIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 38.3% YoY to $6.7bn and European credit ADV was up 10.5% YoY to $2.1bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.8% and a record 9.1% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. European credit volumes continued to be led by strong client adoption of portfolio trading as well as increased client adoption of Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;, Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) and our unique dealer selection tool (SNAP IOI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 21.6% YoY to $363 million (mm).  
<ul>
<li>Volume growth outpaced the broader market, which was up approximately 11% YoY<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-july-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$40.5-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.82-trillion/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>, as Tradeweb institutional and retail volumes surpassed 20% YoY growth amidst robust issuance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 44.0% YoY to $10.8bn.&nbsp;  
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>EQUITIES  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was down 1.7% YoY to $8.0bn and European ETF ADV was up 9.3% YoY to $2.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>ETF market volumes continued to be muted as market volatility remained low. On Tradeweb, U.S. ETF institutional volumes were strong, while wholesale volumes were lower YoY. European ETF volumes increased as clients continued to embrace our automated rules-based trading protocol.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>MONEY MARKETS  &nbsp;</h5>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 25.3% YoY to $621.8bn.  
<ul>
<li>Increased client activity on Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic repo trading platform drove record global repo activity. The combination of quantitative tightening, increased collateral supply, and current rates market activity shifted more assets from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s reverse repo facility to money markets. Retail money markets activity was strong as markets priced in less aggressive Fed rate cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>*All comparisons versus 2Q23 unless otherwise noted.</i></p>
<p>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategy and delivered solid financial results and continued expense and capital discipline. Our strong free cash flow generation model gives us the flexibility to invest for growth and return capital to investors. We repurchased $50 million in shares year-to-date, and our Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $200 million.</p>
<p>The international roll-out of X-Pro and the launch of the next phase of our high-touch strategy is expected to occur late in the third quarter and will include initial elements of AI dealer select functionality. Our announcement yesterday to connect our liquidity pools with ICE Bonds to drive greater efficiency and liquidity in the Municipal and corporate bond markets is a great example of how we are leveraging connectivity to drive future growth.</p>
<p>In summary, we made significant progress in executing our strategy in the second quarter, and we believe the strategic priorities we have established will drive increased market share and higher levels of revenue growth for shareholders in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="bwmarginl1"><b>Credit Commission Revenue</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Total credit commission revenue of&nbsp;<b>$160.8</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<b>$33.2</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;in fixed-distribution fees) increased&nbsp;<b>$6.8</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;, or&nbsp;<b>4%</b>&nbsp;, compared to&nbsp;<b>$154.0</b>&nbsp;<b>million</b>&nbsp;(including&nbsp;<b>$35.3 million</b>&nbsp;in fixed-distribution fees) in the prior year. The increase in total credit commission revenue was driven principally by higher emerging markets, U.S. high-grade and Eurobonds commission revenue. Strong growth in these products was partially offset by lower U.S. high-yield commission revenue on lower credit spread volatility. The decline in variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$148.16</b>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<b>$157.42</b>&nbsp;in the prior year was mainly due to product and protocol mix-shift, principally lower levels of U.S. high-yield activity and increased portfolio trading.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>The decrease in fixed-distribution fees was principally driven by the consolidation of two global dealers and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1"><b>Credit Trading Volumes</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Strong growth in total credit average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;) to&nbsp;<b>$13.7 billion</b>&nbsp;, up&nbsp;<b>12%</b>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<b>Record $55.0 billion&nbsp;</b>in&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>total portfolio trading volume, up&nbsp;<b>143%</b>&nbsp;compared to the prior year, and up&nbsp;<b>24%&nbsp;</b>from 1Q24.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></li>
<li><b>34%</b>&nbsp;Open Trading share&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of total credit trading volume, in line with the prior year. The Company delivered estimated&nbsp;<b>price improvement</b>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;via Open Trading of approximately&nbsp;<b>$110 million</b>&nbsp;in the quarter.</li>

We believe the decrease in U.S. high-yield estimated market share year-over-year was driven, in part, by&nbsp;<b>lower levels of credit spread volatility</b>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<b>greater focus on the new issue calendar</b>&nbsp;by our long-only client segment.

<p><b>Non-GAAP financial measures and other items</b></p>
<p>To supplement the Company&rsquo;s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&ldquo;EBITDA&rdquo;), EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by revenues. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and net change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers, less expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide additional information regarding the Company&rsquo;s operating results because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and evaluating the performance of our business. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, GAAP net income margin to EBITDA margin and GAAP net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities to free cash flow.</p>
<p>Please refer to Tables 6 &amp; 7&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54104935&amp;newsitemid=20240805496841&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=3&amp;md5=4b97a1c3a45ecb76ff36d7ad40372915" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Due to variances in how portfolio trading market participants utilized the portfolio trading TRACE &ldquo;flag,&rdquo; the Company previously used its own internal methodology for calculating portfolio trading as an estimated percentage of TRACE volume and the Company&rsquo;s estimated market share. The Company is reviewing recent improvements in the TRACE data, but it now believes that the portfolio trading TRACE &ldquo;flag&rdquo; more accurately reflects the true size of the portfolio trading market. As such, at this time, the Company is not presenting portfolio trading as an estimated percentage of TRACE volume or the Company&rsquo;s portfolio trading estimated market share for the second quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>In addition, for periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share. Prior comparable periods have been recast retrospectively for both Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds to conform to the updated presentation of the data. The new estimated market volume data is also available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54104935&amp;newsitemid=20240805496841&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=4&amp;md5=fdb98467f415a1036d1c3fbbabf6870f" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<title>Biotech IPO Raising Soars Sixfold QoQ in Q1 2024 Amid Renewed Investor Optimism, Reveals GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> IPOs, biotech, Q1 2024, GlobalData, investor optimism <br />
Summary:<br />
- IPOs in biotech surged in Q1 2024, indicating pent-up demand after a two-year decline. 
- Strong clinical data may encourage more biotech IPOs in late 2024.
- H1 2024 had six IPOs raising over $100 million each, renewing investor optimism. 
- Switzerland, the US, and India led in biotech IPO raises in 2024. 
- Updated rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange aim to boost London's position as a major financial hub. <div>
<p><span><span>Biotech initial public offerings (IPOs) surged in the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, with eight completed IPOs raising $3.72 billion&mdash;six times the amount raised in Q4 2023 and marking the highest quarterly biotech IPO value in over a year on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) comparison. This increase followed a two-year decline, indicating pent-up demand. Going forward, robust clinical data may encourage more biotech companies to go public later in the year, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3D0nkm_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CIf5jHM7L0a7n2JNJKQ7GrH0rYmMXsallAnv-2FY6uIMOyda0I9tYCLLXtpZRvn2cCAnr7IMGWonNn0XH0-2FhcYm1-2FxsJkRM4Ylnias18noVNM5hIKw59THOL1ddjvVE52Y0ycKZFcz36lp9nqGIXeRmo3FVzXRiOILeRmhVvEy45968Usw8cJwPL5db8GohM9q5gxXK1Kiwt6Fjx9XNYsBCvh66YdD4-2FZ1m2n05DWPvTo0-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharmaceutical Intelligence Center, the surge in completed biotech IPO raising in Q1 2024 followed a two-year decline from $30.8 billion in 2020 to $5.9 billion in 2022 and $4.4 billion in 2023.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;High interest rates during 2022 and 2023 led investors to prioritize the existing portfolios over new opportunities, causing many biotechs to delay their IPOs until market conditions improved.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The increase in IPO value raised in Q1 2024 set a strong pace for the year, possibly reflecting the pent-up demand after a two-year slump. The first and largest biotech IPO to date was CG Oncology, raising $437 million for its armed oncolytic virus therapy, CG-0070.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan adds: &ldquo;Despite a decline in IPOs in Q2 2024, companies with strong clinical data that previously struggled to secure funding may now see early 2024 successes as an opportunity to pursue public offerings.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_.jpg" title="GlobalData_Biotech_IPOs_H1_24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In H1 2024, six completed IPOs each raised over $100 million, totaling nearly $5 billion. This is more than double the $2.2 billion raised by five high-value IPOs in H1 2023. This surge, along with more venture funding, has renewed investor optimism. In 2024, biotech companies in Switzerland, the US and India led with the highest IPO raises, with $2.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $273 million, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority has recently updated the rules for listing companies on the London Stock Exchange. These changes are meant to make it easier for companies to go public and boost London&rsquo;s position as a major financial hub post-Brexit. The new rules aim to improve Britain&rsquo;s capital markets, attract more investment, and make London a strong competitor to financial hubs like New York and the EU.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;The growth in completed IPOs in the first half of 2024 marks a positive shift following a period of downturn. This reflects renewed investor optimism to create new opportunities for companies with strong clinical data. The success of IPOs in the first quarter may prompt more biotechs to go public in the latter half of the year, although investors remain cautious as market conditions stabilize.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Includes all completed IPO deals for companies headquartered globally from H1 2020&ndash;H1 2024. Includes deals where deal values are disclosed in the public domain.</span></span></span></p>

<div> director, promoter, manager, ban, breach <br />
Justice Robinson banned Wei Zhong and Regina Ding for 9 years for market manipulation and imposed penalties, emphasizing their lack of integrity and remorse. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Wei (Walker) Zhong and Lei (Regina) Ding have been banned from being a director, promoter or manager of an entity, as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct 2013 (FMC Act), for nine years, the High Court has ruled.</p>
<p>Mr Zhong was the Executive Chairman and CEO of Oceania Natural Limited; Ms Ding was a senior manager and marketing director of Oceania Natural Limited.</p>
<p>The pair were found to have breached the market manipulation and disclosure provisions under the FMC Act in April 2023. They received the highest penalties imposed to date for breaching the market manipulation provisions. Mr Zhong received a penalty of $1.3m and Ms Ding was ordered to pay $760,000.</p>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; sought banning orders for both Mr Zhong and Ms Ding and costs as part of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Justice Robinson awarded the FMA costs of approximately $468,000.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, welcomed the decision. She said: &ldquo;Banning orders are designed to protect the public from harm and hold egregious conduct, as was displayed in this case, to account. Senior managers of listed companies have a responsibility to act with integrity and trust, Mr Zhong and Ms Ding&rsquo;s conduct fell well short of what was expected of them. As Justice Robinson stated, Mr Zhong and Ms Ding&rsquo;s misconduct was flagrant and dishonest, and they showed a complete lack of remorse and contrition.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Issues Final Joint Guidance To Help Certain Large Banks Further Develop Their Resolution Plans</title>

<div> guidance, resolution plans, banks, Federal Reserve, submission deadline
Summary:
The Federal Reserve issued final guidance for certain large banks' resolution plans, setting a new submission deadline of October 1, 2025. The guidance addresses key areas of vulnerability and provides expectations for different resolution strategies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Monday issued final joint guidance to help certain large banks further develop their resolution plans. The final guidance is largely similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230829b.htm">proposed guidance</a>&nbsp;from August 2023 and incorporates changes in response to comments received. The Board developed the guidance jointly with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and it is now final following both agencies' approval.</p>
<p>These resolution plans, also known as living wills, describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure.</p>
<p>The guidance generally applies to domestic and foreign banks with more than $250 billion in total assets but that are not the largest and most complex banks, for which guidance is already in place. The guidance addresses the specific characteristics of, and risks posed by, this group of banks.</p>
<p>The guidance is organized around key areas of potential vulnerability, such as capital, liquidity, and operational capabilities that could be needed in resolution. Distinct from the guidance to the largest and most complex banks, this guidance provides agency expectations for both single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, which are different strategies banks have adopted for their rapid and orderly resolution. It also recognizes that the preferred resolution outcome for foreign banks is often a successful home country-led resolution and guides foreign banks on how to address the global resolution plan in their U.S. plan.</p>
<p>The agencies also announced that they are extending the resolution plan submission deadline for the banks to which the guidance applies. Banks will be required to submit their resolution plans by October 1, 2025, instead of March 31, 2025. The purpose of the extension is to provide reasonable time for banks to consider the final guidance as they develop their plan submissions.</p>

<div> London, Thomas Ellis, Hakluyt, managing partner, global strategic advisory<br />
Summary:<br />
Thomas Ellis elected as managing partner at Hakluyt, with prior experience in the EMEA region and banking. Committed to leading the firm's future success. <div>
<p>Hakluyt, the global strategic advisory firm for businesses and investors, is delighted to announce that Thomas Ellis has been elected the firm's new managing partner.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg799bleft"><img align="middle" alt="Hakluyt announces election of Thomas Ellis as new managing partner" id="prnejpg799bleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2475585/Hakluyt_New_Managing_Partner.jpg" title="Hakluyt announces election of Thomas Ellis as new managing partner" /></div>
<p>Currently based in London, Tom joined Hakluyt eight years ago, and has served as the company's chief operating officer for the past two years. He previously led Hakluyt's client-facing business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, and before that ran the firm's office in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Prior to Hakluyt, he worked at Lloyds Banking Group, including as director of business banking, and as a civil servant in the UK Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>Lord Paul Deighton, Hakluyt's chairman, said: "Tom has been elected managing partner with strong support from across the Hakluyt partnership &ndash; so he has a clear mandate for his vision for the firm and plans for the future. I, along with the rest of the board, congratulate him and look forward to giving him our full support as Hakluyt enters its 30th year and continues to go from strength to strength.</p>
<p>"I should also like to record my thanks to Holly Morrow for doing an excellent job as acting managing partner since the departure last month of our previous managing partner, Varun Chandra, for a role in the UK government."</p>
<p>Tom added: "I am honoured to have been elected by my peers to lead Hakluyt as its new managing partner. After eight brilliant years with the firm, it is a privilege to have this opportunity to build on the excellent work of my predecessors and colleagues, and lead us into our next chapter.</p>
<p>"As the operating environment for business leaders around the world becomes ever more complex, demand for Hakluyt's advice and expertise continues to grow in all regions. It is my overriding goal to ensure that we continue to be as well placed as possible to help our clients succeed."</p>

Summary:<br />Online brokerages Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments experienced outages as investors offloaded risky assets amid recession fears, while Wall Street plummeted due to weak economic data. Robinhood Markets also resumed trading after a pause. <div>
<p>On Monday, online services at brokerages Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments experienced significant outages as many investors sought to offload risky assets amid fears of a potential U.S. recession.</p>
<p>Users reported difficulties logging into their accounts, a problem that the trading apps confirmed without further details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Charles Schwab site, a warning notice said, "Due to a technical issue, some clients may have difficulty logging in to Schwab platforms and may have difficulty reaching us by phone. Please accept our apologies as our teams work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Wall Street's main indexes plummeted, driven by weak economic data, disappointing second-quarter earnings from major technology firms, and rising geopolitical tensions, which reignited recession concerns and dampened hopes for a soft landing.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Robinhood Markets, a popular platform among retail investors, stated it had resumed overnight trading after a temporary pause.</p>

Global securities finance industry revenue decreased 11% from July 2023. U.S. equity lending revenue fell 20%, while Taiwanese securities revenue increased 59%. Sovereign debt revenue improved 8%. Corporate bonds revenue fell 23%. Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., ImmunityBio Inc., and NuScale Power Co. were the top revenue-earning securities. <br /><br />Summary: <br />Global securities finance industry revenue decreased 11%. U.S. equity lending fell 20%, while Taiwanese securities revenue increased 59%. Sovereign debt revenue improved 8%, but corporate bonds revenue fell 23%. The top revenue-earning securities were Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc., Beyond Meat Inc., ImmunityBio Inc., and NuScale Power Co. <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The global securities finance industry generated $843 million in revenue for lenders in July 2024, according to DataLend, the market data service of fintech EquiLend. The figure represents an 11% decrease from the $943 million generated in July 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global broker-to-broker activity, where broker-dealers lend and borrow securities from each other, totaled an additional $219 million in revenue in July, down 7% year-over-year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Amid a continued bull market, U.S. equity lending revenue remained the most significant laggard, falling 20% year-over-year. Decreased fees were the driver, with the average cost to borrow for U.S. stocks declining 21% from July 2023. However, with fees bouncing in July, U.S. equities showed positive momentum with a 22% revenue increase month-over-month.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the global equity lending market, Taiwanese securities continued to generate strong returns with revenue increasing 59% year-over-year. Loan balances for Taiwan equities climbed a sharp 43% while fees also increase 11% compared to 2023.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In fixed income, global lending revenue for corporate bonds continued to cool, falling 23% year-on-year. The dip was driven by investment-grade issuances, where a 28% drop in fees led to a 21% decline in revenue.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Global sovereign debt revenue improved 8% year-on-year as balances climbed 15%. U.S. Treasury lending accounted for the bulk of the improvement, with revenue rising 14%.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The top five earning securities in July were</span><span>&nbsp;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI US), Lucid Group Inc.</span><span>&nbsp;(LCID US),&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND US),&nbsp;</span><span>ImmunityBio Inc. (IBRX US)</span><span>&nbsp;and NuScale Power Co. (SMR US)</span><span>. The five securities in total generated $87 million in revenue for the month.</span></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: As Tappable Equity Hits Record High Of $11.5T, 3 Of 5 Mortgage Holders Have At Least $100K To Borrow Against</title>

<div> Equity, Mortgage debt, Tappable equity, Leverage ratio, Underwater mortgages
Summary:<br /><br />Outstanding mortgage debt at all-time high of $13.8T, but home prices drive equity to record $17.6T. Tappable equity hits $11.5T. Underwater mortgages at 0.60%. Texas, Florida, and Louisiana worth watching.<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Even as outstanding mortgage debt hit an all-time high of $13.8T in June, rising home prices outpaced that growth, driving mortgage holder equity to its own new record high of $17.6T in Q2 2024</li>
<li>Climbing equity has eased overall leverage in the market, with total mortgage debt equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, down from 44.6% in Q1 and the third lowest leverage ratio of the past 20+ years</li>
<li>Tappable equity &ndash; the amount a borrower can access while maintaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; also hit a new peak in June at $11.5T, a +4% gain from Q1 and +9.2% year over year</li>
<li>32M mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and nearly 1.2M have $1M or more, with higher equity holders tending to have lower first lien rates as well</li>
<li>Borrowers with 760+ credit scores hold two-thirds of tappable equity; a similar share is held by those with sub-4% first lien rates, an inherent incentive to use second lien debt to tap equity, should the need arise</li>
<li>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater nationwide, representing just 0.60% of active mortgages, with another 4.2% having less than 10% equity in their homes</li>
<li>Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas, increasing the number of borrowers in negative equity positions</li>
<li>Nationally, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in markets where prices have pulled back from recent highs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its August 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>&nbsp;, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>Though the ICE Home Price Index (HPI) has shown a general slowdown in the rate of home price growth through June &ndash; and in some locales, price declines driven by surplus inventory &ndash; mortgage holders&rsquo; equity levels continue to hit new heights. As Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Research and Analysis, explains, there is more outstanding mortgage debt today than at any point in history, but at the same time, overall market leverage remains near all-time lows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outstanding mortgage debt, including both first and second liens, hit an all-time high in June, but growth in home prices has outpaced that gradual rise in debt,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;Total cumulative debt leverage &ndash; essentially a loan-to-value ratio for the entire mortgage market &ndash; is equivalent to 44.1% of underlying home values, the third lowest leverage ratio we&rsquo;ve seen in the past 20-plus years. Rising home prices have also continued to build the fortunes of existing homeowners, pushing tappable equity &ndash; the amount a mortgage holder can leverage while retaining a healthy 20% equity cushion &ndash; to its highest level ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine out of ten of mortgage holders (48.5M) have some degree of tappable equity. A fair representation of the addressable market for second lien lending, tappable equity continues to be held primarily by higher credit score borrowers with low first lien interest rates. Two-thirds of such equity is held by mortgage holders with credit scores of 760 or higher, with a similar share held by those with first lien rates below 4%.</p>
<p>Three out of five (32M) mortgage holders have at least $100K in tappable equity; 4.6M have at least $500K, and 1.2M have $1M or more. Higher equity levels tend to correspond with lower first lien interest rates, as those borrowers, on average, were able to capitalize on record low interest rates while also buying into the market earlier at lower prices. The average first lien rate of borrowers without tappable equity is approximately 5.5%, nearly a full percentage point above those with up to $50K available to borrow against (4.45%). Borrowers with $50-$199K to borrow against have average first lien rates of just above 4%, while those with $500K or more to borrow against have average rates of around 3.75%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home equity lending has been sluggish since interest rates began their climb higher early in 2022,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;As the Fed raised short-term lending rates, accessing equity became more expensive for homeowners, evidenced by the anemic growth in such lending despite record levels of available, tappable equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Industry expectations that the Fed will soon begin easing short-term rates could gradually change that dynamic, given the more direct impact short term rates have on home equity rate offerings, and lenders would do well to prepare. The ability to originate and service home equity loans alongside first lien mortgages will be key &ndash; to say nothing of using data-driven portfolio analysis to identify potential second lien customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fewer than 325K homeowners are underwater on their mortgages nationwide, putting just 0.60% of active loans in a negative equity position, with another 4.2% holding less than 10% equity in their homes. That said, Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are worth watching as inventory grows and home prices soften in some areas.</p>
<p>In Austin, for example, home prices are more than 15% off 2022 peaks, resulting in some 2.6% of mortgage holders owing more than their homes are currently worth. Similarly, in San Antonio, 2.7% of homes are underwater. Negative equity rates are also rising in Florida, as Cape Coral, Lakeland, North Port and Jacksonville &ndash; where inventories have surged and home prices are softening &ndash; have all seen an increase in negative equity. The same is true of New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana. Nationwide, 84% of underwater mortgages were originated within the past 3.5 years; that share climbs above 97% in areas like San Antonio, Austin, Cape Coral and North Port, where prices have pulled back from recent highs.</p>

<title>Save The Date! ACER Workshop: Designing Electricity Network Tariffs To Fit The Energy Transition (30 September 2024)</title>

<div> workshop, tariffs, ACER, network, electricity<br />
Summary: 
ACER organizes a workshop on electricity tariffs, discussing dilemmas, solutions, and best practices, and collecting stakeholders' views. <div>
<p>Achieving the EU's climate and energy goals requires significant investment in new network capacities, which increases pressure on network tariffs. Meanwhile, the ongoing electrification and changing grid usage patterns challenge existing tariff designs.</p>
<p>In a decentralised and digitalised energy landscape, these challenges also present opportunities (such as more flexible users and increased automation). Cost-reflective and transparent tariffs can encourage efficient network connection and usage, reducing costs for users.</p>
<p>Setting tariffs is complex, with no &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; design, as regulators need to balance different principles and national specifics. Regulators and stakeholders can benefit from discussing challenges and sharing effective tariff solutions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the event about?</span></p>
<p>Every two years,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECAFSBFFUBUwNVAxSHVYKBgMdUFwHVhpRUVcDAwsNUw8AVFMdUFFVAgkFVlsdVg8NVR0GXwBXGgwHAAYZClZWUlMOBgBTUFoHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER reviews</a>&nbsp;national tariff practices and reports on methodologies and the most effective approaches.</p>
<p>Ahead of ACER&rsquo;s next electricity tariff report (early 2025), ACER organises a workshop to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify the most pressing transmission and distribution tariff dilemmas;</li>
<li>debate potential solutions and best practices to address them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Save the date &amp; get involved!</span></p>

<div> July, small business, consumer spending, retail, restaurant
Summary:<br />Small business sales rose 3.5% year-over-year and 1.3% month-over-month, with strong retail growth and declining restaurant sales. Utilities and hospitals were the fastest growing categories. <div>
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index rises to 141</i> </li>
<li><i>Small business sales grew 3.5% year-over-year, and 1.3% month-over-month</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade; for July 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the pace and nature of consumer spending at small businesses in the United States at national, state and industry levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fiserv Small Business Index provides timely and granular insight into consumer spending at small businesses, which is often a bellwether for the broader economy,&rdquo; said Jennifer LaClair, Head of Merchant Solutions at Fiserv. &ldquo;Following modest declines in June, consumer spending rebounded nicely in July to help many small businesses start the second half of the year strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for July rose to 141. This jump in consumer spending followed a four-point decline in June. On a year-over-year basis, both small business sales (+3.5%) and transactions (+3.3%) grew compared to July 2023. Month-over-month small business sales grew (+1.3%) despite transactions slightly declining (-0.7%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending patterns continue to shift, most notably with Retail spend experiencing a decisive bounce back compared to June,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Specialty trade and professional services also performed very well due to seasonal demand and stabilizing inflation rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Retail</span></p>
<p>July saw strong retail spending growth as the national Retail index rose by four points to 146. Year-over-year retail sales (+4.6%) and transactions (+5.8%) increased and all retail subsectors showed growth compared to June. General Merchandise (+10.9%) led retail in yearly growth, followed by Health and Personal Care (+8.6%), Building Equipment and Garden Materials (+6.2%), Food and Beverage Retailers (+4.9) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.7%).</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, retail sales (+2.5%) and transactions (+0.1%) grew as higher average ticket sizes drove short-term spending, even though foot traffic remained relatively flat. Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers (+4.8%) and Furniture, Electronics and Appliances (+4.8%) led growth compared to June, followed by General Merchandise (+3.5%) and Health and Personal Care (+3.1%).</p>
<p><span>Restaurant</span></p>
<p>Food Services and Drinking<span>&nbsp;</span>Places<span>&nbsp;</span>indexed at 123 for July, a 4-point decline from June. On an annual basis, restaurant sales declined (-1.6%) despite seeing modest growth in foot traffic (+0.7%). Consumers dining out have also seen a significant decrease in average ticket size (-2.4%) compared to July 2023.</p>
<p>Month-over-month restaurant sales (-3.1%) and transactions (-1.4%) both decreased compared to June 2024, marking a second consecutive month of slowing restaurant sales and foot traffic. Similar to the yearly trend, average ticket sizes also declined (-1.7%) on a monthly basis &ndash; indicating that consumers may be feeling some pricing relief when dining out.</p>
<p><span>Other Industry Movers</span></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services continue seeing significant growth in sales (+15.2%) and transactions (+13.9%) year-over-year. Month-over-month performance was strong as well with both total sales and transactions growing (+3.6%) compared to June. Gains in this industry were across a broad range of services, some of which saw increased demand following harsh weather events in June.</li>
<li>Specialty Trade Contractors grew sales (+5.7%) and transactions (+2.5%) year-over-year. Month-over-month sales (+3.0%) also rose despite total transactions (+0.1%) holding steady. Demand for air conditioning and related services drove most of the spending increase, along with broader demand for general construction and carpentry.</li>
<li>Additional year-over-year growth categories included Web Search, Libraries and Information Services (+20.4%), Amusement/Gambling/Recreation (+8.3%) and Food Manufacturing (+8.1%); the sharpest annual declines were in Real Estate (-12.3%) and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing (-10.5%).</li>
<li>Utilities (+6.2%) and Hospitals (+5.7%) were the fastest growing small business categories on a monthly basis; Performing Arts, Spectator Sports and Related Industries (-2.4%), Accommodation (-1.2%) and Insurance (-0.1%) each saw modest month-over-month declines.</li>

The total rates ADV was $22.3 billion, up 32.0% versus the prior year.  <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for July 2024.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;In July, we delivered 12% growth in total credit ADV, driven by an 18% increase in U.S. high-grade, an 18% increase in Eurobonds, a 7% increase in emerging markets and a 65% increase in Municipal bonds on record estimated market share. We also generated record portfolio trading ADV of $972 million. These strong results helped offset a decline in U.S. high-yield ADV. We are not pleased with the progression of U.S. credit market share in July, but we are encouraged by the prospect for potential increases in market volatility in the coming months. We believe that our strategy, including the expansion of our portfolio trading offering and dealer solutions, through the roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro to our global client base, will drive future market share expansion in U.S. credit.&rdquo;</p>

<div> mortgage broker, FCA, order, vulnerable consumers, unauthorised

Summary:
FCA secures £4m order against unauthorised mortgage broker and associates for exploiting vulnerable consumers. Judgment finds serious breaches by LPI and NPI. Trapped individuals with deceptive practices. Enforcement action taken. An order for recovery of funds issued.  <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has secured an order of &pound;4m against an unauthorised mortgage broker and its associates who exploited vulnerable consumers.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>London Property Investments (U.K) Limited (LPI) arranged mortgages while NPI Holdings Limited (NPI) bought properties and rented them back to the sellers, both without FCA authorisation. Daniel Stevens, the director of LPI and NPI, and his father, Tony Stevens, were also found liable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt described these breaches as &lsquo;serious contraventions, conducted over an extended period, involving high levels of culpability including deception of the consumers and the lenders, and which took advantage of the consumers&rsquo; vulnerability&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4 defendants are ordered to pay around &pound;4 million to the FCA. This is an important next step in the case. The FCA will need to recover funds before any compensation can be paid to affected individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LPI is required to remove restrictions registered against the titles of 4 properties. These restrictions were used to force individuals to pay exorbitant fees to LPI. If these fees were not paid, then the individual could not sell or re-mortgage their property. In some cases, this trapped individuals into high-interest bridging loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;&lsquo;These sham brokers preyed on vulnerable people who were struggling financially and trapped them with exorbitant fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The defendants used a smokescreen of deception which cost consumers and lenders dearly. This was a complex case, but the ruling shows that these were serious breaches of our rules. &nbsp;It is only right that we can now pursue LPI, NPI, Daniel and Tony Stevens to compensate for the losses they caused the victims.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In his judgment, Mr Justice Fancourt found that LPI had contravened the general prohibition in section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) in relation to 26 further individuals identified by the FCA, and that Tony Stevens and Daniel Stevens were both knowingly concerned in these contraventions. He ordered the defendants to pay for losses caused to these and 45 other individuals.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In July 2020, the FCA obtained an interim injunction and a freezing order to stop these activities and freeze residential properties and other assets owned by Tony and Daniel Stevens and the 2 companies. Read the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-commences-civil-proceedings-relation-alleged-unauthorised-regulated-mortgage-contracts-and-sale" title="FCA commences civil proceedings in relation to alleged unauthorised regulated mortgage contracts and sale and rent back agreements">press release</a>&nbsp;in relation to the commencement of proceedings dated 13 July 2020. &nbsp;</p>

<div> MOU, ESG Data Platform, financing, collaboration, sustainability<br />
Summary:<br />
SET and EXIM Thailand collaborate to enhance sustainable finance, develop ESG-linked financing, and support businesses in achieving sustainability goals. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Thailand) to enhance the ecosystem for sustainable finance. This collaboration, under the ESG Data Linkage and Exchange Project, aims to leverage sustainability performance data of listed companies via the ESG Data Platform. In addition, the partnership will support the SET Carbon system for EXIM Thailand's clients to achieve sustainability goals, aligning with SET&rsquo;s commitment to driving all sectors towards sustainable growth.</p>
<p>SET and EXIM Thailand will jointly develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-linked financing in the third quarter of 2024, with the lending service scheduled to commence in 2025.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b> said that SET has recognized the growing demand for ESG data among investors and financial institutions to develop ESG-related financial and investment products for sustainable development. SET has accelerated the development of ESG data technologies and platforms to meet the demand. Currently, SET has a broad range of ESG data management systems, including the SET ESG Data Platform, which has been operational since 2023 and has compiled ESG data of over 700 listed companies. The upcoming SET Carbon system, slated for 2025, will enable listed companies and their supply chain partners to efficiently calculate and report greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SET unwaveringly fosters collaborations with both domestic and international entities to ensure continuous data exchange and utilization, particularly in using ESG data for fundraising and investment purposes.</p>
<p>The collaboration with EXIM Thailand is expected to increase opportunities for the business sector in accessing funding and financial tools, marking a significant step in developing a sustainable financial ecosystem in Thailand.</p>
<p><b>EXIM Thailand President Rak Vorrakitpokatorn</b> emphasized the banking sector's crucial role in driving balanced growth across economic, social, and environmental dimensions as well as tackling today&rsquo;s environmental challenges. Development banks worldwide are pivotal in providing financing that supports businesses in adapting and thriving, representing up to one-third of global Climate Finance. Positioned as Thailand&rsquo;s Green Development Bank, EXIM Thailand has continuously developed Greenovation to support environmentally friendly projects and businesses.</p>
<p>This partnership with SET represents a collaborative integration between public and private sectors, utilizing an internationally standardized database to propel the Thai financial sector towards sustainability. It also encourages businesses to become more aware of ESG. ESG data from SET will enhance the efficiency of EXIM Thailand's operations while promoting business access to various financial products and benefits, including participation in the Green Export Supply Chain. This will facilitate efficient and effective greenhouse gas management and reporting, compliance with international environmental standards, achievement of sustainable development goals, and drive Thailand towards carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>This partnership will facilitate data connectivity and exchange, increase operational flexibility, and create opportunities for businesses seeking investment to support sustainability goals. SET and EXIM Thailand will co-develop financial products, services, and benefits for stakeholders, while expanding the sustainability ecosystem to help Thai businesses achieve their sustainability and business objectives, particularly in climate change strategies.</p>

<title>Data Beta: Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Joint Data Standards Proposal, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<div> Interoperability, Legal Entity Identifier, Financial Data Transparency Act, FDTA, data standards
Summary:<br /><br />Implementation of FDTA for financial data transparency examined for costs, benefits, and practicality, emphasizing public input and flexibility in rulemaking. <div>
<p>I support issuing this proposal, which is the first step in implementing the Financial Data Transparency Act (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), which seeks to enhance the accessibility, usefulness, and interoperability of data reported to federal financial regulators. Together with other US financial regulators, we are proposing joint data standards, which we will then apply to our respective rulebooks in agency-specific rulemakings.</p>
<p>If well implemented, the FDTA could enhance the analytical capability of regulators, investors, and other market participants and reduce compliance costs for regulated entities. However, this result is not guaranteed. Mangling implementation could result in costs disproportionate to the benefits. FDTA regulations, for example, could drive municipal issuers away from securities markets, prevent companies from going and staying public, or force the publication of unreliable data. To maximize the potential for the FDTA to serve the public interest, we need broad public input. I urge commenters to address the questions in the proposing release and my additional questions below, as well as to provide advance thoughts on the second, agency-specific, phase of the FDTA rulemaking process.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Costs and benefits</i>: The Commission did not conduct an economic analysis for this proposal, so I particularly welcome commenters&rsquo; input on the proposal&rsquo;s costs and benefits and the economic consequences of subsequent choices that individual agencies might make in their second phase rulemakings.<ol>
<li>Costs of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the total direct and indirect costs of adopting the contemplated data standards? Do these costs vary based on factors such as firm size or type of regulatory filing?</li>
<li>How have standardized data costs changed over time? Will these trends continue?</li>
<li>How much of the FDTA compliance burden is likely to stem from the one-time cost of setting up new data systems as opposed to ongoing compliance costs?</li>
<li>Will certain types of entities, such as municipal issuers, bear disproportionate FDTA-related costs? If so, what can we do to reduce those costs?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Benefits of FDTA implementation:<ol>
<li>What are the potential benefits of FDTA implementation?</li>
<li>How could the Commission maximize the utility of financial regulatory information filed in compliance with the FDTA-mandated data standards? For example, should the Commission work to reduce error rates in structured data filings?</li>
<li>In light of the Commission&rsquo;s broad discretion in implementing the second phase of FDTA rulemaking, are there areas where full application of these proposed data standards would be particularly helpful or unhelpful?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Financial Data Interoperability.&nbsp;</i>The FDTA aims to promote the interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><ol>
<li>What could the benefits of interoperability be in the intermediate and longer term? What level of interoperability is necessary to achieve these benefits?</li>
<li>What are the largest hurdles to interoperability of financial regulatory data across financial regulators? How should we address those hurdles?</li>
<li>How could we achieve the benefits of interoperability without imposing unnecessary costs on reporting firms, particularly smaller ones?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Legal Entity Identifier</i>: The FDTA mandates a &ldquo;common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license for all entities required to report to&rdquo; the regulators.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The proposal specifies this standard as&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), which the Global LEI Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) manages and supports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><ol>
<li>Mandating the adoption of any product or service managed by a third-party carries risks, including the possibility that the third-party could use its regulatory-mandated advantage to, for example, raise fees inordinately, demand obtrusive information from registrants, or provide poor service. Is this a risk of the LEI mandate? If so, how can we mitigate this risk, or does the existing regulatory oversight of the GLEIF already adequately manage this risk?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Would timely obtaining and maintaining the required LEIs be manageable for small entities and for large entities with many subsidiaries?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>How would an LEI mandate integrate with other entity identifiers such as the Central Index Key (&ldquo;CIK&rdquo;), which identifies EDGAR filers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>CUSIP and FIGI</i>:&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>The proposal&rsquo;s scope designates as an identifier of financial instruments the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (&ldquo;FIGI&rdquo;), which is &ldquo;established by the Object Management Group . . . an open-membership standards consortium.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The joint rulemaking does not include the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedure (&ldquo;CUSIP&rdquo;), a common securities identifier, because CUSIP is &ldquo;proprietary and not available for open license in the United States.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><ol>
<li>Does the FDTA&rsquo;s statutory mandate extend to financial instruments?</li>
<li>Is the proposing release correct that the FIGI does and the CUSIP does not meet the FDTA&rsquo;s criteria for designation as a joint standard? If CUSIP does not now meet the criteria, what changes would enable it to do so?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li><ol start="3">
<li>What, if any, policy issues arise from the FIGI being managed by a standards consortium?</li>
<li>How should the Commission consider FIGI and CUSIP in setting data standards for financial instruments in the second-phase rulemaking?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Scope of the data standards</i>: To implement the FDTA successfully, we need to scope it properly and remain within statutory parameters.<ol>
<li>Did the joint regulators strike the right balance when choosing the proposal&rsquo;s scope, in light of the statutory mandate?</li>
<li>What policy issues should the Commission consider when adapting its rulebook to conform to the joint data standards, particularly given the statutory discretion afforded to the Commission (and other implementing agencies) in the second-phase rulemaking?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li><i>Principles-based regulation and maintaining updated FDTA standards</i>: Hardwiring a technology into a rule runs the risk of preserving that requirement far after that technology&rsquo;s expiration date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;To benefit from FDTA implementation, we need meaningful consistency of data standards across agencies, which requires at least some specificity regarding data standards. If we are not vigilant, however, the FDTA could inhibit data standards from evolving over time or force firms to maintain parallel data systems. The proposal affords some flexibility in data transmission and schema and taxonomy format standards,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;while specifying other data standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><ol>
<li>Does the proposal strike the right balance between principles and prescription? If not, how should the approach change?</li>
<li>Would the balance the proposal strikes allow data standards to be updated in a timely manner? If not, what would work better?</li>
<li>How often should regulators revisit the mandated standards to ensure that they remain current? Should we build a requirement to revisit the standards into the final rule?</li>
<li>How, if at all, will artificial intelligence or other technologies influence the need for structured data? How should we take these potential future developments into account in implementing the FDTA?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed rule is a reasonable first step in the FDTA implementation journey. For this process to have the best chance of unlocking the FDTA&rsquo;s promise and avoiding its peril, public discussion is essential. I welcome commenters&rsquo; thoughts on these questions and how the second phase should unfold, particularly given the meaningful flexibility that the joint regulators will have during that phase.</p>
<p>Joint rulemakings are inevitably challenging. I therefore particularly appreciate the hard work of staff in the SEC&rsquo;s Divisions of Corporation Finance, Economic and Risk Analysis, Investment Management, and Trading and Markets, and in the Offices of the Chief Data Officer, Credit Ratings, the General Counsel, and Municipal Securities, along with staff at the other financial regulators who have worked on this first stage of FDTA implementation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;This first phase of FDTA implementation deals only with standards applicable to all agencies, so some common standards used in SEC filings are not reflected in the proposal but could be reflected in the Commission&rsquo;s phase two rulemaking.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Data Standards, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Aug. 2, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Joint Data Standards, LEI, FDTA, Commission, proposal
Summary:<br />The Commission proposes joint data standards, including LEI, for financial reporting, considering concerns over mandating payments to private organizations. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>As part of the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Congress directed the Commission and other financial regulatory agencies to jointly propose data standards for (1) certain collections of information reported to each agency by financial entities and (2) the data collected from the agencies on behalf of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint standards with the other agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;One part of the proposal establishes International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17442-1:2020, Financial Services &ndash; Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;), as the joint standard for the legal entity identifier. While LEI satisfies the FDTA&rsquo;s requirements for a joint data standard, I have concerns were the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and other agencies to ultimately mandate the exclusive use of LEI from a specific organization.</p>
<p>LEI is managed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (&ldquo;GLEIF&rdquo;) and issued through &ldquo;local operating units&rdquo; (&ldquo;LOUs&rdquo;). Although GLEIF is overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee, of which the Commission is a member, neither the committee nor any LOU is a federal or state regulator. Entities must pay a fee to an LOU both to initially obtain an LEI and to renew the LEI annually.</p>
<p>While the fee may be&nbsp;<i>de minimis</i>&nbsp;to some entities, mandating payments to a private third party as a condition to satisfying legal requirements raises significant concerns &ndash; especially when such fees are not subject to approval by Congress or the Commission. If a company wants to raise capital by filing a registration statement, then it needs to first purchase an LEI from a third party.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;If a school or water district seeks to issue tax-exempt bonds to pay for infrastructure, then it needs to purchase an LEI before it can submit materials to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The FDTA amends section 124(c)(1)(A) of the Financial Stability Act to require the joint standards to include &ldquo;a common nonproprietary legal entity identifier that is available under an open license.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The term &ldquo;open license&rdquo; means a legal guarantee that a data asset is made available at no cost to the public and with no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing, or adapting such asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Given these concerns, the Commission should consider alternatives to requiring regulated entities to pay for something &ndash; such as an LEI &ndash; if free alternatives, such as the Central Index Key (CIK) used to make EDGAR filings with the Commission<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;or the file number issued by the Delaware Department of State&rsquo;s Division of Corporations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;are available and may also satisfy the FDTA&rsquo;s data standard requirements. One option, consistent with certain of the Commission&rsquo;s forms,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;is to require an entity to use and disclose its LEI only if that entity has already obtained one for other purposes.</p>
<p>I look forward to reviewing the public comments from investors and market participants on the LEI requirement and other aspects of the proposal. In receiving feedback, I am particularly interested in whether the joint data standards being proposed, including LEI, can be obtained or used by non-traditional business organizations that exist today or that may exist in the future, such as those in the crypto and digital assets industry.</p>
<p>Because of the Congressional mandate to undertake this rulemaking, I will support the joint proposal. I thank staff from across the Commission who worked on this proposal, and I would especially like to recognize the staff of the Office of the Chief Data Officer, the Division of Corporation Finance, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis for their involvement and engagement with my staff and me.</p>

<title>Statement On Financial Data Transparency Act Proposed Joint Rulemaking, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Aug. 2, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-financial-data-transparency-act-proposed-joint-rulemaking-sec-chai/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission is proposing joint data standards for information collected by nine financial regulators (the &ldquo;Agencies&rdquo;). Through the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 (&ldquo;FDTA&rdquo;), Congress mandated that the Agencies propose such standards. In fulfilling the Congressional mandate, I&rsquo;m pleased to support this proposal, as it will make financial data collected by the Agencies more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public.</p>
<p>Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.</p>
<p>The proposal puts forward standards with regards to data identifiers, as well as ways to transmit and structure data.</p>
<p>First, with regards to identifiers, the Agencies propose a number of identifiers related to entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For instance, with regards to entities, the joint proposal would establish Legal Entity Identifier (&ldquo;LEI&rdquo;) as a common entity identifier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, as it relates to geographic jurisdictions, the proposed joint standards use U.S. postal service abbreviations, as well as country codes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;With regard to products and instruments, the proposed joint standard uses three internationally recognized standards for financial instrument identifiers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>All of these common identifiers are non-proprietary and available under an open license.</p>
<p>Secondly, the joint proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to transmitting and structuring data. Under the proposal, any specific format (e.g., eXtensible Markup Language) that enables the structuring and transmission of high-quality, machine-readable data would be permitted.</p>
<p>In addition, Congress required in the FDTA that the joint data standards must, to the extent practicable, &ldquo;use, be consistent with, and implement applicable accounting and reporting principles&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-financial-data-transparency-act-080224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the Agencies are seeking comment on whether to establish joint data standards regarding existing definitions of generally accepted accounting and financial reporting terms. Doing so would benefit both investors and the financial entities who report data.</p>
<p>Upon finalization of these joint standards, Congress has mandated that the SEC and certain other Agencies issue Agency-specific rules that implement the standards. In accordance with the FDTA, Agencies will be permitted flexibility in considering how best to implement the final joint standards.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Department of the Treasury, Commodity Futures Trading Commission<span>,&nbsp;</span>the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for working with the SEC on this joint rule.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Data Transparency Act, joint data standards, financial regulatory agencies, interoperability <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC proposes joint data standards for financial regulatory agencies to promote interoperability and enable high-quality, machine-readable data submission from financial institutions. <div>
<p>Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed joint data standards under the Financial Data Transparency Act of 2022 that would establish technical standards for data submitted to certain financial regulatory agencies. Eight additional agencies have proposed or are expected to propose the joint standards: the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>The proposed joint standards would promote interoperability of financial regulatory data across the agencies by establishing common identifiers for entities, geographic locations, dates, and certain products and currencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proposal will make financial data more accessible, uniform, and useful to the public,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Consistent data standards will make it easier for financial institutions to file reports across multiple agencies. They also will help regulators be more effective and efficient in carrying out our oversight functions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, the proposal would establish a principles-based joint standard with respect to data transmission and schema and taxonomy formats, which would enable financial institutions to submit high-quality, machine-readable data to the agencies.</p>
<p>The agencies are in various stages of approving the proposed joint standards, with some agencies scheduled to vote in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The public comment period for the proposed joint standards will remain open for 60 days following publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<div> resolution, IMF, Executive Directors, Sub-Saharan Africa, representation
Summary: IMF Board of Governors approved a resolution to add a 25th chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on the Executive Board, effective November 1, 2024. <div>
<p>On July 16, 2024, the IMF Board of Governors, the highest decision-making body of the IMF, issued a new resolution to increase the number of Executive Directors on the IMF&rsquo;s Executive Board by adding a 25th chair intended for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>This resolution follows the call, made by the International Monetary and Financial Committee during the 2023 Annual Meetings in Marrakech, for the creation of a 25th chair to improve Sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s voice and representation and the overall balance of regional representation at the Board (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2023/10/14/pr23353-chairs-statement-forty-eighth-meeting-of-the-imfc">See Press Release 23/353</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board of Governors have taken an important step towards creating an additional 25th&nbsp;chair at our Executive Board to increase Sub-Saharan Africa's representation in IMF decision making, to make our Board more inclusive, and to reflect the region's role in the global economy,&rdquo; said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approval by the Board of Governors to change the size of the Executive Board requires an 85 percent majority of the total voting power. The Fund&rsquo;s membership approved the resolution allowing for the creation of a 25th chair, exceeding the required threshold.</p>
<p>The new Executive Board of 25 Executive Directors will take office on November 1, 2024.</p>

<div> exemption, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Singapore, swap execution facility, regulation <br />
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance.<br />
Summary: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved an amended order exempting two Singapore market operators from SEF registration requirements under comparable regulation. MAS will monitor compliance. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it unanimously approved an amended order that exempts two recognized market operators (RMOs) authorized within Singapore from CFTC swap execution facility (SEF) registration requirements. The exempted RMOs are FMX Securities (Singapore) Pte. Limited and LMAX Pte. Ltd.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Section 5h(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides that the CFTC may grant such an exemption if it finds that a foreign SEF is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in the facility&rsquo;s home country.&nbsp;</span>Likewise, t<span>he CFTC may revoke exempt status when a facility is no longer authorized and/or in good standing in its home country.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On March 13, 2019, the CFTC issued an order determining the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulatory framework for approved exchanges (AEs) and RMOs satisfies the standard in CEA section 5h(g) to exempt a SEF from registration with the CFTC. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7887-19"><span>7887-19</span></a><span>] Under the order, MAS agreed to, on an ongoing basis, request such exemptions for facilities meeting certain legal requirements within Singapore. MAS also agreed to notify the CFTC when an AE or RMO no longer satisfies those requirements and to request the non-compliant facility be removed from exempt status.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This amendment brings the total number of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/International/ForeignMarketsandProducts/ExemptSEFs#Singapore"><span>exempted AEs and RMOs</span></a>&nbsp;<span>to 18.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>"Cboe reported another strong quarter with record net revenue of $514 million, diluted EPS of $1.33, and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $2.15, up a robust 21% from the second quarter of 2023," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "The second quarter results illustrate the durability of the Cboe business model with year-to-date net revenue increasing by a strong 8% and adjusted diluted EPS<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;coming in 17% higher as compared to first half 2023 levels. I am incredibly pleased with the progress we continue to make as we work through our strategic review, the early output of which is evidenced by our solid expense management trends, improved year-over-year EBITDA margins, and additive capital allocation actions with $90 million of share repurchases during the second quarter and a total of $180 million for the first half of the year. Each component of our exchange ecosystem performed well during the second quarter, and we are well positioned for the second half of the year."</p>
<p>"Cboe reported strong 10% year-over-year net revenue growth in the second quarter as each category of our business posted solid year-over-year trends," said Jill Griebenow, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. "Cash and Spot Markets performance was robust with net revenues growing 15% during the second quarter of 2024. Derivative trends were also solid, up 11% year-over-year, and Data and Access Solutions delivered 5% year-over-year net revenue growth. Notably, adjusted EBITDA margins<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;reached 67% through the first half of 2024, up more than two percentage points as compared to the first half of 2023, and we returned nearly $300 million in capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Moving forward, we anticipate organic total net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to finish in the 6-8% range, up from our prior guidance of the higher end of 5-7%. We are reaffirming our Data and Access Solutions organic net revenue growth<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of 7-10%, but anticipate finishing at the lower end of the guidance range. Additionally, we are reaffirming our full year adjusted operating expense guidance<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;range of $795 to $805 million. We have produced strong results for the first half of 2024 and look forward to delivering durable returns for shareholders in the quarters ahead."</p>

<li>Total operating expenses were $303.7 million versus $222.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of $81.4 million, primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets recognized in the Digital reporting unit. Adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of $197.1 million increased 2 percent compared to $192.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services, partially offset by a decline in travel and promotional expenses.</li>
<li>The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 30.8 percent as compared with 30.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to the valuation allowance associated with the impairment of the Globacap investment. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;was 29.5 percent, down 0.2 basis points when compared with 29.7 percent in last year's second quarter.</li>

<p><b>Discussion of Results by Business Segment:</b></p>
<p><b>Options:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Options net revenue of $306.7 million was up $23.5 million, or 8 percent, from the second quarter of 2023. Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased primarily as a result of a 9 percent increase in index options trading volumes versus the second quarter of 2023. Access and capacity fees and market data fees were 3 percent higher than the second quarter 2023.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased $27.3 million, or 11 percent, reflecting a 1 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV") and a 9 percent increase in total options RPC compared to the second quarter 2023. The increase in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a higher percentage of total options volume.</li>
<li>Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 31.2 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 33.3 percent in the second quarter of 2023, a result of lower multi-list market share as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>North American (N.A.) Equities:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>N.A. Equities record net revenue of $98.3 million increased $7.5 million, or 8 percent versus the second quarter of 2023, reflecting higher net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>, proprietary market data fees, and access and capacity fees.</li>
<li>Net transaction and clearing fees<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;increased by $7.0 million, or 25 percent, compared to the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by stronger U.S. exchange and off-exchange net capture rates, as well as stronger volumes and market share in Canadian Equities as compared to the second quarter of 2023.</li>
<li>Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 11.4 percent for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 12.7 percent in the second quarter of 2023 given higher off-exchange and closing auction share. Cboe's U.S. Equities off-exchange market share was 17.8 percent, down from 19.9 percent in the second quarter of 2023 as overall industry alternative trading systems ("ATS") market share declined as a percentage of off-exchange share. Canadian Equities market share rose to 15.0 percent as compared to 14.5 percent in the second quarter of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Europe and Asia Pacific (APAC):</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Europe and APAC net revenue of $54.3 million increased by 15 percent compared to the second quarter of 2023, reflecting growth in transaction and non-transaction revenues. On a constant currency basis<sup>2</sup>, net revenues were $55.2 million, up 17 percent on a year-over-year basis. European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was &euro;9.6 billion, up 4 percent compared to the second quarter of 2023 given a 10 percent increase in industry market volumes, partially offset by lower market share. Japanese Equities ADNV was 71 percent higher and Australian Equities ADNV was 12 percent higher than the second quarter of 2023.</li>
<li>For the second quarter of 2024, Cboe European Equities had 22.5 percent market share, down from 23.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Total market share was negatively impacted by elevated closing auction activity on listing venues and lower lit book market share. Cboe European Equities net capture rate increased 9 percent given a mix shift to higher capture products. Cboe Australia had 20.8 percent market share for the second quarter of 2024, up from 18.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023. Cboe Japan grew market share to 5.5 percent in the second quarter of 2024 from 4.1 percent in the second quarter of 2023.</li>

<p><b>2024 Fiscal&nbsp;Year Financial Guidance</b></p>
<p>Cboe provided guidance for the 2024 fiscal year as noted below.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Organic total net revenue growth<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;is expected to be in the range of 6 to 8 percentage points, up from previous guidance calling for the higher end of 5 to 7 percentage points in 2024.</li>
<li>Anticipates lower end of organic net revenue<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;growth range from Data and Access Solutions of 7 to 10 percentage points in 2024.</li>
<li>Reaffirms adjusted operating expenses<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $795 to $805 million. The guidance excludes the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets of $92 million; the company reflects the exclusion of this amount in its non-GAAP reconciliation.</li>
<li>Reaffirms depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $43 to $47 million, excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.</li>
<li>Reaffirms minority investments are expected to contribute a $37 to $43 million benefit in 2024 to non-operating (expenses) income. Anticipates that $33 to $37 million of the benefit will come in the earnings on investments line and $4 to $6 million through the other (expense) income, net line.</li>
<li>Reaffirms the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for the full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of 28.5 to 30.5 percent. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation.</li>

<div> Westminster magistrates court, Peterson Okoh, mortgage fraud, FCA, unauthorized activities
Summary:
Westminster magistrates court hearing alleged mortgage fraud by Peterson Okoh, accused of unauthorized activities and false representation, sent to trial. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Peterson Okoh (of Peckham, London SE15) appeared in Westminster magistrates court on 31 July 2024 for allegedly advising on and arranging mortgages, between January 2018 and December 2023, without being authorised.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also alleges a significant number of mortgage applications advised on and arranged by Mr Okoh contained false information and/or were supported by forged documents.</p>
<p>Mr Okoh has been charged by the FCA with 3 counts of fraud by false representation and 1 count of carrying on regulated activities without authorisation. Mr Okoh has pleaded not guilty to all counts.</p>
<p>The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 28 August 2024.</p>
<p>Peterson Okoh has been released on conditional bail with conditions of home residence, not to carry on acting as a mortgage advisor while unauthorised, and not to contact prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly pending his next appearance.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date of Birth: Peterson Okoh (01/10/1960)</li>
<li>The most obvious example of a 'regulated mortgage contract'&nbsp;is a loan made to an individual to enable the individual to buy a home for themselves where the loan is secured on that home. For legal definition of a 'regulated mortgage contract',&nbsp;please refer to Article 61(3)(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Regulated Activities) Order 2001.</li>
<li>Carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without authorisation is contrary to section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and is punishable by a fine or up to 2 years in prison.</li>
<li>Fraud by False Representation is contrary to section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006 and is punishable by a fine or up to 10 years in prison.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Okoh has been charged with: 
<ul>
<li>3 counts of fraud by false representation; and</li>
<li>1 count of breaching s19 FSMA</li>

<div> Expansion, Dormant Assets Scheme, Charities, Social Enterprises, Financial Assets
Summary:<br /><br />Millions in dormant funds unlocked for charities and social enterprises, supporting UK growth. FCA facilitates expansion of Dormant Assets Scheme to empower local businesses. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>We have amended our rules and guidance to enable dormant investment assets and client money to be available to the Dormant Assets Scheme (DAS).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Millions in dormant funds have been unlocked for charities and social enterprises, as new rules set out today facilitate the expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme.&nbsp;<span>This second phase of the expansion will bring dormant investment assets and client money in scope.</span></p>
<p>Led by industry and backed by government, the Dormant Asset scheme aims to reunite people with their financial assets. Where that is not possible, this money supports UK growth through good causes such as getting young people into work or offering affordable credit to families.</p>
<p>Since 2011, the UK Dormant Assets Scheme has unlocked more than &pound;745m for social and environment initiatives, from over &pound;1.35 billion in dormant bank and building society accounts. The expansion of the scheme is estimated to potentially unlock a further &pound;880m.</p>
<p>This initiative not only reunites people with their lost money but also empowers local businesses to drive positive change across local communities.</p>
<p>The policy statement outlines technical changes in our Handbook to facilitate the full expansion of the Dormant Assets Scheme in the remaining expanded asset classes. The FCA&rsquo;s intention is to ensure any Handbook changes allow firms to participate in the Dormant Assets Scheme and consumers to access reclaims.</p>

<p><span>Iress (IRE: ASX) today announces it has completed the sale of its UK Mortgage Sales &amp; Originations (&ldquo;Mortgages&rdquo;) business to Bain Capital Tech Opportunities LP (&ldquo;Bain Capital&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.iress.com%2Fdocuments%2F1542%2FASX_Release_Iress_enters_into_binding_agreement_with_Bain_Capital_to_sell_its__UxPxwIT.pdf/1/0102019111f0aac0-77f3768b-943b-44c6-9f5a-c48dfcbd9b26-000000/uUtdU57tYXCnq8p9riaw4x8Cqm4=385" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>As announced on 15 March 2024</span></a><span>, Bain has purchased the UK Mortgages business for a total cash consideration of &pound;85m ($A167m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>) before costs.</span></p>
<p><span>Iress&rsquo; Mortgages business provides mortgage sales and origination software (MSO) and associated consulting services to banks and building societies in the UK. Iress acquired the Mortgages business over 10 years ago, during which time it has become a leading provider of mortgage origination software in the UK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group CEO, Marcus Price, said</span></strong><span>: &ldquo;This is the fourth and largest divestment we have successfully executed under our transformation program. The net proceeds of all divestments have been used to retire debt, with our debt to leverage ratio seeing considerable improvement - paving the way for a return to maintainable dividends. As we enter the final months of our transformation program, we can already see a stronger Iress with an improved earnings profile, balance sheet strength and execution discipline priming Iress for future growth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Iress&rsquo; Group Executive - Wealth &amp; UK, Harry Mitchell</span></strong><span>, said: &ldquo;Completion of the sale was contingent on the novation of existing MSO client contracts to the new owners and we&rsquo;re pleased to have gained the full support of all Mortgages clients. We are confident this is a great result not only for Iress, but also for our clients and people, with Bain Capital fully committed to re-investing in the technology and capabilities that power MSO. Iress&rsquo; UK operations now have a streamlined focus on its core competencies, and we remain committed to driving excellence for our clients in the UK.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Net proceeds from the sale are expected to be approximately &pound;75m ($A147m</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>). Iress will provide support services for a period of up to 12 months after the transaction on a cost recovery basis to ensure a smooth transition.</span></p>

<title>ASX Commences Final Of Two Consultations To Decide Scope And Implementation For CHESS Replacement</title>

<div> consultation, ASX, CHESS replacement, settlement cycle, T+1
Summary:<br />ASX consults on CHESS replacement and T+1 settlement cycle, proposes implementation in 2026 and 2029, seeks stakeholder feedback by September 2024.<br /> <div>
<p>ASX today released a public consultation paper which proposes the CHESS replacement settlement and subregister services be implemented in 2029. The paper is the second of two consultations undertaken by ASX this year to gather industry feedback on scope and implementation for the project to replace Australia&rsquo;s cash equities clearing and settlement system (CHESS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also today, ASX published its summary of feedback received on the industry whitepaper it released in April that sought input on a potential move to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1.</p>
<p>Taken together, these papers underscore the ongoing stakeholder engagement ASX has been undertaking to ensure it continues to work closely with industry on the delivery of CHESS replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance</b> said &ldquo;Our commitment to transparent and collaborative consultation is central to the success of the CHESS replacement project as well as Australia&rsquo;s approach to T+1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposal to implement CHESS replacement across two main releases reflects how we&rsquo;ve listened to industry feedback. The staged approach to implementation, where we are delivering the clearing services first in Release 1, followed by delivery of settlement, subregister and additional clearing enhancements in Release 2 is designed to manage several factors, including materially reducing delivery risk and allowing for industry readiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stakeholder input provided via working groups and other forums is incorporated in the consultation paper published today and is reflected as part of the functional scope of Release 2. Industry driven improvements outlined in the consultation paper include items such as continuous netting, account segregation and corporate action elections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responses to the industry whitepaper on T+1 settlement were also a key input into the consultation paper, helping inform the proposed sequencing of CHESS replacement implementation stages and the potential move to T+1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of responses from industry suggest a clear preference to avoid implementing T+1 at the same time as Release 2 of CHESS replacement,&rdquo; Mr Triance said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In light of the feedback received to the industry whitepaper and having regard to the experiences of transitioning to T+1 in other markets we have presented a number of options on timing to transition to T+1 in Australia, and outlined the risks and benefits of each of the options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a decision is made to move to T+1, the paper recommends the option where that would take place at an appropriate time after the implementation of CHESS replacement Release 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX confirmed in June that the delivery of Release 1 is expected to occur in H1 2026. This consultation paper proposes that Release 2 be delivered in 2029, aligning with indicative timeframes previously communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Next steps in consultation process</b></h4>
<p>We encourage feedback from CHESS users and software providers (including both external vendors and CHESS users developing in-house systems), as well as other interested stakeholders on the proposals outlined in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASX is seeking stakeholder feedback by Friday, 13 September 2024. ASX will then take time to review submissions and proposes to provide a consultation response paper in Q4 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
<p>CHESS is the clearing and settlement system for Australia&rsquo;s cash equities market. ASX is undertaking a project to replace CHESS and in November 2023 ASX announced it would proceed with a product based solution design for CHESS replacement that would be delivered by global technology provider TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).&nbsp;</p>

Summary: The MAS has set up a Review Group to strengthen Singapore's equities market, focusing on market challenges, listings, regulatory enhancements, and stakeholder participation. <br /><br /> <div>

<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced that a Review Group has been set up to recommend measures to strengthen equities market development in Singapore. The Review Group will be chaired by Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for Transport, Second Minister for Finance and Board Member of MAS, and comprise key private sector stakeholders and public sector representatives.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>A dynamic equities market is an important part of the capital formation value chain, alongside Singapore&rsquo;s growing private equity and venture capital ecosystem. A deep and liquid public equities market enables companies to access capital as they expand regionally and globally. It also allows asset owners and the investing public to participate in the growth of quality companies. Improving the attractiveness of Singapore&rsquo;s equities market can therefore enhance Singapore&rsquo;s standing as a vibrant enterprise and financial hub. This in turn complements Singapore&rsquo;s innovation and start-up ecosystem, private markets, as well as asset and wealth management sectors.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Government has introduced various initiatives to support enterprise financing and enhance Singapore&rsquo;s equities markets. These include the set-up of cornerstone funds to support initial public offerings of high-growth companies, introduction of corporate structures and share classes to facilitate such listings, and measures to improve research coverage.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group will build on these efforts to position Singapore&rsquo;s equities market for growth. The Group will consider additional initiatives to improve the vibrancy of our equities market, and study ways to galvanise greater private sector participation in this effort, including from capital market intermediaries, investors, and listed companies. The Review Group will be supported by two workstreams:</p>
<p>a. The Enterprise and Markets workstream will aim to address market challenges, foster listings, and facilitate market revitalisation; and<br />b. The Regulatory workstream will focus on enhancing the regulatory regime to facilitate market growth and foster investor confidence.<br /><br />The Terms of Reference and composition of the Review Group are set out in Annex A.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>Through the two workstreams, the review process will involve stakeholders with expertise and experience in diverse fields in the capital markets, including corporate finance, investment banking, asset management, legal services, and corporate governance. The Review Group will recommend a set of measures to strengthen the Singapore equities market and complete its report within 12 months.<br /><br /></p>

<title>ASIC’s First Greenwashing Case Results In Landmark $11.3 Million Penalty For Mercer</title>

<div> Penalty, Greenwashing, Financial Services Industry, ESG Claims, Mercer Superannuation<br />
Summary:<br />
- Mercer Superannuation fined $11.3 million for misleading ESG claims<br />
- ASIC's first greenwashing case for financial services industry<br />
- Found to have made misleading statements about sustainable investment options<br />
- Importance of accurate ESG claims highlighted<br />
- Additional cases and infringement notices issued for alleged greenwashing practices<br /> <div>
<p>In a landmark case for ASIC, the Federal Court has ordered Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited to pay a $11.3 million penalty after it admitted it made misleading statements about the sustainable nature and characteristics of some of its superannuation investment options.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, 'This was ASIC&rsquo;s first greenwashing case brought before the Federal Court; a landmark case both for ASIC and for the financial services industry. It demonstrates the importance of making accurate ESG claims to investors and potential investors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court found Mercer made misleading statements on its website about seven &lsquo;Sustainable Plus&rsquo; investment options offered by the Mercer Super Trust, of which Mercer is the trustee. These statements marketed the Sustainable Plus options as suitable for members who &lsquo;are deeply committed to sustainability&rsquo; because they excluded investments in companies involved in carbon intensive fossil fuels like thermal coal. Exclusions were also stated to apply to companies involved in alcohol production and gambling.</p>
<p>The Court found members who took up the Sustainable Plus options had investments in companies involved in industries the website statements said were excluded, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>15 companies involved in the extraction or sale of carbon intensive fossil fuels (including AGL Energy Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Glencore PLC and Whitehaven Coal Ltd),</li>
<li>15 companies involved in the production of alcohol (including Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Ltd, Carlsberg AS, Heineken Holding NV and Treasury Wine Estates Ltd), and</li>
<li>19 companies involved in gambling (including Aristocrat Leisure Limited, Caesar&rsquo;s Entertainment Inc, Crown Resorts Limited and Tabcorp Holdings Limited).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Today&rsquo;s matter is a strong example to the financial services industry of the greenwashing action we will take. We will continue to monitor the market for ESG-related claims that cannot be validated by evidence to ensure the market is fair and transparent,&rsquo; Ms Court added.</p>
<p>When handing down his decision Justice Horan remarked, &lsquo;The contraventions admitted by Mercer are serious. They arose from failures by Mercer to implement adequate systems to ensure that ESG claims in relation to its superannuation products were accurate, and to monitor and enforce the application of any sustainability exclusions associated with such ESG claims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Horan also commented: &lsquo;&hellip;it is vital that consumers in the financial services industry can have confidence in ESG claims made by providers of financial products and services.  As is the case in many other industries, consumers may place great importance on ESG considerations when making investment decisions. Any misrepresentations in relation to ESG policies or practices associated with financial products or services, whether as an aspect of &ldquo;greenwashing&rdquo; practices or otherwise, undermines that confidence to the detriment of consumers and the industry generally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mercer Super has agreed to pay ASIC&rsquo;s costs.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Strike Force, unfair pricing, illegal pricing, anticompetitive practices
Summary:
SEC Chair addresses the mission of the SEC, enforcement actions against unfair pricing, rulemaking projects, market oversight, and the potential impact of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good afternoon. I&rsquo;m honored to take part in the first meeting of the Strike Force on Unfair and Illegal Pricing. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>As President Joe Biden said at our most recent Competition Council meeting with him, if you are &ldquo;engaging in illegal practices that are fraudulent or unfair or deceptive or anti-competitive &hellip; we will enforce the law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain that which sits in the middle: fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Thus, guarding against deceptive, fraudulent, or anticompetitive practices is at the heart of what we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>When Congress established the SEC 90 years ago, they embedded antifraud provisions in our key statutes. Congress gave us additional authorities in the 1970s to promote competition and guard against anticompetitive practices when the word competition was added to our statute 20 times.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC pursues these important mandates from Congress every day in overseeing the more than $110 trillion capital markets.</p>
<p>As President Biden further said when announcing the Strike Force, capitalism without competition is not capitalism.</p>
<p>The SEC addresses unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive business practices in all of our work, through enforcement, rulemaking, and market oversight.</p>
<p>The SEC, working through its Enforcement Division, is the cop on the beat for the securities markets. The Commission brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, resulting in $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;While there are many cases related to fraud or unfair practices, I&rsquo;ll highlight three that directly relate to unfair and illegal pricing. Earlier this year we settled an action against TIAA-CREF for making recommendations to retail customers while failing to disclose that substantially equivalent lower-cost shares were available.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Last year, we settled a case against Wells Fargo for overcharging advisory accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In 2022, we charged three Charles Schwab investment adviser subsidiaries for not disclosing they were sweeping cash to its affiliate bank, loaning it out, and then keeping the difference between the interest earned on the loans and what it paid in interest to clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through rulemaking projects, works to enhance competition across all three parts of our mission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;We do so by promoting transparency, access, and fair dealing in the markets. Among the most important projects are focusing on promoting greater competition and access in the $27 trillion U.S. treasury markets<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;as well as the more than $50 trillion equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The SEC, through our market oversight, examines registrants. We review the tens of thousands of filings we receive every year from broker-dealers, investment advisers, stock exchanges, clearinghouses, self-regulatory organizations, and issuers. As we conduct such oversight, we stay true to the mandates Congress laid out to guard against fraud and deceptive practices and promote competition.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to mention what may be one of the most transformative technologies&mdash;not only for this time but perhaps our lives, artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-strike-force-080124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This technology offers tremendous promise for individuals and our economy. At the same time, all of our agencies will be pressed to grapple with what this technology means when it comes to guarding against deception, fraud, and anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>As it relates to the securities markets, bad actors might seek to use AI to deceive or defraud the public, investors, and the market. Make no mistake, though, under the securities laws, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>As it relates to the potential for anticompetitive behavior, we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere in our economy that one or a small number of tech platforms can come to dominate a field. Due to cost, reach, and network economics, we may see the same come to pass in the fields of AI and related data aggregation. Further, bad actors might try to use AI to game the system and signal to competitors about pricing or otherwise to undermine competition.</p>
<p>I look forward to collaborating with others here on these important matters.</p>

<div> Supreme Court of Canada, BCSC, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, financial sanctions, Poonians
<br />
The BCSC seeks changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after the Supreme Court ruled that financial penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy. The court ruled in favor of BCSC's disgorgement orders but against administrative penalties. BCSC has had over 40 debts extinguished through bankruptcy since 2001. The BCSC is calling for a revision of the law to address this loophole.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The BCSC is calling for changes to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act after a Supreme Court ruling regarding financial penalties and bankruptcy. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is calling for changing the federal&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some financial sanctions can be extinguished through the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>The court, in a 5-2&nbsp;<a href="https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/20555/index.do" target="_blank">decision</a>, said that administrative penalties, which are imposed by the BCSC and other Canadian securities regulators to deter future misconduct, can be eliminated from a person&rsquo;s debt upon being discharged from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case demonstrates one of the many challenges securities regulators face in collecting financial penalties from lawbreakers,&rdquo; said BCSC Chair &amp; CEO Brenda Leong. &ldquo;The fact that administrative penalties can be extinguished through bankruptcy seriously undermines securities regulators&rsquo; duty to protect investors, and highlights a significant flaw in federal bankruptcy law that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruling came in litigation between the BCSC and a B.C. couple, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian. A BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2014/73-bcsc-panel-finds-that-five-bc-residents-engaged-in-market-manipulation" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;that they ran a pump-and-dump scheme involving an Ontario company whose shares traded on the TSX Venture Exchange.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel concluded that the Poonians inflated the company&rsquo;s share price through trading among themselves, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and then illegally obtained approximately $7 million by selling shares to unsuspecting buyers, many of them living paycheck to paycheck. Most of them had no idea they were victims of misconduct until they were contacted by the BCSC.</p>
<p>The BCSC panel levied two types of financial sanctions against the Poonians:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative penalties of $13.5 million, intended to deter future misconduct by the Poonians and others who might contemplate committing similar wrongdoing</li>
<li>Disgorgement of $5.6 million, representing the amount the Poonians obtained from their illegal activity. Any funds collected for disgorgement orders can be returned to victims of that misconduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Poonians have not made any effort to pay. After the BCSC imposed its sanctions, they filed for bankruptcy. The Poonians asked the B.C. Supreme Court to extinguish their debts, including those owed to the BCSC but that request &ndash; which was opposed by the BCSC &ndash; was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2020/33-bc-couple-owing-19-million-to-bcsc-must-remain-in-bankruptcy" target="_blank">denied</a>&nbsp;by the court in 2020.</p>
<p>The BCSC also applied to the court for an order that its financial sanctions against the Poonians persist, even if all of the couple&rsquo;s other debts are extinguished through bankruptcy, because the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;allows some types of debts to survive bankruptcy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debts arising from a fine, penalty or restitution order imposed by a court, and</li>
<li>Debts arising by obtaining property or services by false pretenses or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCSC argued that its sanctions &ndash; both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders &ndash; met those criteria.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously agreed with the BCSC that &ldquo;the Poonians&rsquo; scheme to mislead and exploit investors amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation.&rdquo; But it did not agree that the sanctions, despite being registered with a court, qualified as court-imposed orders.</p>
<p>The court&rsquo;s five-member majority said there is a direct link between the amounts of the disgorgement orders and the Poonians&rsquo; fraudulent conduct, so those debts to the BCSC survive bankruptcy. But the administrative penalties, the majority said, arose most directly from the BCSC&rsquo;s decision to sanction the couple, and only indirectly from the Poonians&rsquo; unlawful conduct. So those penalties, the majority said, are extinguished if the Poonians exit bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two justices dissented, saying that the administrative penalties, along with disgorgement, should persist to &ldquo;ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that the Poonians, as a result of this decision, will forever owe $5.6 million, which represents the money they obtained from their pump-and-dump scheme,&rdquo; Leong said. &ldquo;However, this has always been about more than this one case, and we are disappointed that people who cheat or swindle investors can avoid paying administrative penalties through an exit from bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2001, more than 40 individuals and companies, owing a total of about $80 million to the BCSC, have gone through bankruptcy, and as a result, have had their BCSC debts extinguished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in its written opinion, said that Parliament could have drafted the&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>&nbsp;to expressly say that financial sanctions of regulatory bodies or administrative tribunals are exempt from bankruptcy discharge. But the Act does not say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An obvious solution is to revise the law to deal with this &lsquo;escape hatch,&rsquo;&rdquo; Leong said.</p>

<title>The EBA And ECB Release A Joint Report On Payment Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) published today a joint Report on payment fraud data. The report assesses payment fraud reported by the industry across the European Economic Areas (EEA), which amounted to &euro;4.3bn in 2022 and &euro;2.0bn in the first half of 2023. The Report confirms the beneficial impact of strong customer authentication (SCA) on fraud levels.</span></p>
<p>The Report examines the total number of payment transactions and the subset of fraudulent transactions in terms of value and volume. In addition to the aggregated values, the Report also presents data based on volumes and also sorted by type of payment instruments, i.e. credit transfers, direct debits, card payments, cash withdrawals, and e-money transactions.</p>
<p>SCA-authenticated transactions featured lower fraud rates than non-SCA transactions, especially for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes. Furthermore, fraud shares for card payments, both in terms of values and volumes, were 10 times higher when the counterpart is located outside the EEA, where the application of SCA is not legally required and may therefore not have been requested. Hence, the report confirms the beneficial impact of the SCA requirements that were introduced by the PSD2 and the supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2018/389/oj">technical standards</a>&nbsp;that the EBA had issued in 2018 in close cooperation with the ECB.</p>
<p>The Report also finds that losses due to frauds were distributed differently among liability bearers depending on the payment instrument.</p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB will continue to monitor fraud data and going forward, will publish the aggregate data on an annual basis. This initial rReport presents observations in a descriptive way, while future editions will also include explanations of the data and observed trends.</p>
<p><span>Background and legal basis</span></p>
<p>The EBA and the ECB, in their respective roles as supervisory authority of payment service providers and overseer of payment systems, instruments, schemes and arrangements, closely monitor developments in payment fraud. Both the EBA and the ECB thereby rely on statistical information on the volumes and values of payment transactions and corresponding fraud reported by payment service providers (PSPs) located in the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 96(6) of PSD2, PSPs are required to report statistical data on fraud relating to different means of payment to their competent authorities (NCAs). NCAs, in turn, are required to provide both the EBA and the ECB with this data in aggregated form. In support of these provisions, the EBA Guidelines on fraud reporting under PSD2 (EBA/GL/2018/05, hereafter &ldquo;EBA Guidelines&rdquo;), which apply since 1 January 2019, specify the data that should be reported under the PSD2. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 1409/2013 of the European Central Bank on payments statistics (ECB/2013/43), as amended (hereafter &lsquo;ECB Regulation on payments statistics&rsquo;), requires PSPs located in the euro area to report inter alia detailed information on payment fraud to their national central banks, which in turn shall share the data in aggregated form with the ECB. &nbsp;Data under both the EBA Guidelines and the ECB Regulation on payments statistics is reported on a semi-annual basis.&nbsp;<br />This Report, jointly prepared by the EBA and the ECB, presents a comprehensive overview of the latest data collected under the above-mentioned frameworks.</p>

<p>ISI Markets, the leading provider of macroeconomic data, industry, company and sovereign intelligence, today announces the acquisition of EPFR, the global leader in fund flows and allocation data.</p>
<p>With the acquisition of EPFR, ISI Markets gains a proprietary macro funds flow dataset and proposition, reinforcing ISI&rsquo;s strategy of curating and delivering difficult-to-source &ldquo;macro to micro&rdquo; data, helping inform buy- and sell-side firms&rsquo; strategies and investment decisions across global markets, including on the world&rsquo;s fastest growing and highest potential economies.</p>
<p>EPFR, which is renowned for its breadth, granularity, and frequency of global fund flows coverage, will operate alongside ISI Markets&rsquo; leading global macroeconomic and financial market data business, CEIC. Combining the firms&rsquo; offerings provides ISI Markets&rsquo; clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and banks, comprehensive data and insight on investor sentiment and money movements across regions and asset classes, whilst streamlining workflows and enhancing investment models for economists, quantitative analysts and investment professionals with the tightest integration of datasets.</p>
<p>Steve Pulley, CEO of ISI Markets, commented: &ldquo;The strategic acquisition of EPFR marks a pivotal step in the evolution of ISI Markets. Bringing greater scale in terms of breadth of buy- and sell-side relationships across North America and Europe and material expansion of our proprietary data asset, ISI Markets is now positioned as a unique global data and intelligence platform providing excellent coverage of developed markets whilst remaining best in breed on emerging markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pascal Ambrosi, Partner at Montagu, commented: &ldquo;This acquisition reflects the strong synergy that has developed between EPFR and ISI Markets over time, as the two became truly global service providers with a strategic focus on more deeply supporting buy- and sell-side client workflows. The transaction will also enable the companies to expand their geographic reach and tap into markets in North America/Europe and Asia respectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acquisition follows the partnership announced earlier this year which saw ISI Markets integrate EPFR fund flows and asset allocation data across all major asset classes, tracking over 150,000 traditional and alternative fund-share classes, into CEIC&rsquo;s workflow and analytics platform. By combining EPFR's data with over 3,500 other economic and financial data sources, the combined offering has equipped investment professionals with the ability to better understand the linkages between economic factors, investor sentiment and asset class performance.</p>
<p>EPFR was carved out from Informa PLC by Montagu in October 2022 and is the second acquisition by ISI Markets since Montagu acquired ISI in December 2020 and follows the acquisition of REDD Intelligence, the leading emerging market corporate and sovereign intelligence provider for high yield, private credit, distressed and event-driven special situations.&nbsp; ISI Markets also offers EMIS, the award-winning AI powered market intelligence and research platform.</p>
