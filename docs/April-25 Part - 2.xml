<title>Ontario Securities Commission Research Uncovers Concerns About Finfluencers’ Power Of Persuasion</title>

<p>The Ontario Securities Commission&rsquo;s (OSC) latest research report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-research-and-reports/social-media-and-retail-investing-rise-finfluencers"><em>Social Media and Retail Investing: The Rise of Finfluencers</em></a>, found social media finfluencers have considerable influence on retail investors&rsquo; decision making.</p>
<p>Financial influencers (&ldquo;finfluencers&rdquo;) use their social media platforms to share finance and investing insights. Some finfluencer messaging includes sharing posts about their recent successful stock picks, making claims about their own financial successes and emphasizing the limited availability of an investment opportunity.</p>
<p>An OSC survey of 655 Canadian retail investors found that about 35% of respondents reported making a financial decision based on advice from a finfluencer. Financial advice on social media is appealing because retail investors perceive it to be accessible, free, and informative.</p>
<p>While retail investors believe finfluencers are generally motivated by self-interest, about 40% of investors believe that the finfluencers they follow are trustworthy. Those who have made a financial decision based on finfluencer advice were seven times more likely to trust finfluencers they follow.</p>
<p>Relatedly, those who have made a financial decision based on finfluencer advice were also 12 times more likely to have been scammed on social media. The results suggest that those who trust and follow the advice of finfluencers may be more vulnerable to social media scams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finfluencers have a clear capacity to affect their audience&rsquo;s behaviour, and this influence could diminish retail investor well-being &ndash; especially if the advice is poor quality,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;Our findings reaffirm the importance of understanding how finfluencer content affects retail investor behaviours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also details an online experiment with 1,465 Canadian social media users (both investors and non-investors), which assessed the impact of finfluencers and strategies to combat misinformation. Participants were exposed to social media posts promoting a particular asset during an online trading simulation. The posts resembled the type of content found on Reddit, X and YouTube.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% of participants exposed to finance-related social media posts purchased the promoted assets, compared to about 10% of those not exposed. Non-investors were more likely to be influenced by social media posts compared to those already in the market.</p>
<p>Several interventions used to reduce the persuasiveness of social media content were effective &mdash; however, they did not eliminate the impact of social media messaging entirely.</p>
<p>The OSC collaborated with The Decision Lab to explore the relationship between Canadian retail investors and non-investors and the financial information they encounter on social media.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear SEC Colleagues,</p>
<p>Sometimes, life comes full circle. In October 2006, I joined the Commission as counsel to then-Commissioner Paul S. Atkins. One of his other counsels was Hester Peirce. Today, I take great pride in seeing Paul sworn in as the next Chairman of the Commission.</p>
<p>Now, the transition set in motion by the voters last November is complete. It has been an honor to serve as your Acting Chairman since President Trump signed my designation three months ago.</p>
<p>At the outset, I asked for your patience as we worked to respond and implement the new directions and executive orders from President Trump. I am grateful that you gave it to me.</p>
<p>During the last three months, you have worked hard to advance our mission. At the same time, we bid farewell to many colleagues who opted to retire or otherwise leave the Commission.</p>
<p>We have accomplished many things since January. We established the Crypto Task Force and withdrew enforcement actions in registration-only crypto cases. We replaced SAB 121 and held public roundtables on what regulation of crypto should look like. We provided guidance, including updates to Schedule 13G eligibility, changed FAQs for the Advisers Act marketing rule, and issued Staff Legal Bulletin 14M on shareholder proposals. We removed personally identifiable information from the Consolidated Audit Trail.</p>
<p>We dropped our defense of the climate rule and withdrew the appeal of the dealer rule. We extended certain compliance dates where needed to avoid market disruption, such as the clearing of U.S. Treasury securities. We successfully oversaw the markets during periods of record-breaking trading activity. We resumed having in-person Commission meetings and managed the return to office.</p>
<p>None of these accomplishments could have been done without your efforts. I also want to recognize the contributions of the Division and Office leaders as well as my personal staff in the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s office. Thank you.</p>
<p>I look forward to returning to my regular role as a Commissioner and working on behalf of investors, issuers, and market participants. See you around!</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. Singleton, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is great to be back in Philadelphia, and I look forward to today's discussions on economic mobility.</p>
<p>As monetary policymakers, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee do not have direct control over economic mobility in the U.S. Our key monetary policy tools are not designed to address this issue, nor is economic mobility part of our mandate. However, our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability has implications for a wide range of economic outcomes, including economic mobility. This leads to many important questions about the relationship between the dual mandate and economic mobility. In my remarks, I want to address two such questions. First, does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? And second, does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy?</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-slide2.png" id="fig1">today's talk</a>, I will discuss my views on these questions, but I will not be able to provide definitive answers. Rather, I hope that posing these questions and relaying some of my own thoughts will lead to further discussions during this conference and beyond. Before turning to these questions, let me start with a brief overview of intergenerational mobility in the U.S.</p>
<p><span>Taking Stock of Economic Mobility</span><br />Economic mobility, the ability to move up the economic ladder, is at the heart of the American dream. We tell our children that in the U.S., if you work hard and play by the rules, you can have a secure and successful financial future no matter where you start. We continue to believe strongly in this part of the American dream and remain optimistic that hard work is a primary determinant of later-life success. In a survey from 2019, when respondents were asked which factors are essential or very important to getting ahead in life, nearly 90 percent identified hard work, and only 30 percent indicated coming from a wealthy family.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Policymakers have long been aware of the importance of economic mobility. To illustrate that, let me share a quote from former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke: "Equality of economic opportunity appeals to our sense of fairness, certainly, but it also strengthens our economy. If each person is free to develop and apply his or her talents to the greatest extent possible, then both the individual and the economy benefit."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>With these sentiments of what Americans and policymakers think and feel about mobility in mind, let me turn to some evidence on economic mobility in the U.S. One common way to measure economic mobility is to relate an individual's income in adulthood to their family income during childhood. The measure I am showing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure1.png" id="fig">here</a>&mdash;from Harvard economist Raj Chetty and coauthors&mdash;is likely familiar to many of you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It shows a relative intergenerational mobility measure, also known as the "rank&ndash;rank" relationship. This measure relates a child's ranking in the income distribution as an adult, shown on the vertical axis, to the child's family income rank during childhood, shown on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>The upward slope of the line implies that children born into lower-income families tend to be lower on the income distribution as adults. For example, a child born to the richest parents is, on average, 30 percentage points higher in the income distribution as an adult compared with a child born to the poorest parents. This difference in the relative standing in the income distribution as an adult translates into meaningful differences in earnings levels. To put this in perspective, consider two children who grow up to be 30 percentile points apart on the earnings distribution as adults, with one at the 80th percentile and the other at the 50th percentile. The child who grows up to be at the 80th percentile of the distribution as an adult will earn roughly twice as much compared with the child at the 50th percentile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>In addition to having lower earnings as adults, children born into lower-income families are more likely to experience outcomes that can negatively affect their success in the labor market later in life. Girls born into the bottom decile of the family income distribution are about 10 times more likely to become teenage mothers compared with those born to top-decile families.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Boys born into bottom-decile families are roughly 20 times more likely to be incarcerated in their thirties compared with boys from families in the top decile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Teen pregnancy and incarceration are extreme examples of barriers to labor market success that differentially affect children from lower-income families. More generally, there are numerous reasons that any individual may struggle in the labor market, including skill mismatches and lack of proper training or education.</p>
<p><span>Does Meeting the Dual Mandate Facilitate Economic Mobility?</span><br />Now, let me turn to the Fed's dual mandate and discuss how working toward maximum employment and price stability helps set the stage for broad-based success generally, and how this may provide favorable conditions for upward mobility.</p>
<p>Consider my first question: Does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? To help answer this question, I want to revisit remarks I delivered earlier this year about the implications of noninflationary expansions on shared prosperity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Specifically, I am reflecting on the economic expansion that followed the 2007&ndash;09 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). During that period, the economy expanded for 128 consecutive months, making it the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.</p>
<p>As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure2.png" id="fig">figure 2</a>, the aggregate unemployment rate fell steadily from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 3.5 percent in September 2019, the lowest level recorded in nearly 50 years. The labor market in this period was remarkable in terms of broad-based gains seen across demographic groups, which contributed to a historic narrowing of employment differentials. To illustrate this point, let's add in unemployment rates by levels of education, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure3.png" id="fig">figure 3</a>. In 2019, the unemployment rate gaps between workers with less than a high school education, the solid green line near the top of the chart, and those who had attained at least a bachelor's degree, the solid orange line closer to the bottom, were near multidecade lows. Further, the strong pre-pandemic labor market drew many new participants into the labor force, including teens and younger workers whose employment prospects, and even long-term career trajectories, are especially sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These are the types of labor market conditions that the economist Arthur Okun speculated would increase upward mobility.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In a tight labor market, when individuals move up the job ladder, they create openings for newer or less educated workers.</p>
<p>Moving on to earnings,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure4.png" id="fig">figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows that nominal wage growth increased steadily following the GFC. As with gains in employment, the strong labor market was especially beneficial for some groups. To demonstrate that, let's turn to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure5.png" id="fig">figure 5</a>, which shows wage growth for different earnings levels. Wage growth for the bottom half of earners, the dashed red line, started to pick up about five years into the expansion, and by 2017, it was notably stronger compared with that for workers in the top half of the earnings distribution, the solid blue line.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;These differences in wage growth are important. As the bottom of the distribution catches up to higher earners, wage inequality declines. These are also dynamics that can facilitate upward economic mobility.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the second component of the dual mandate, price stability. While some long economic expansions have led to an unwelcome rise in prices, inflation remained low and stable during the economic expansion following the GFC. Indeed, Federal Reserve policymakers were grappling with inflation somewhat below, rather than above, the longer-run 2 percent target, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure6.png" id="fig">figure 6</a>.</p>
<p>Low and stable inflation is important for individuals and businesses for a variety of reasons. It ensures that the nominal wage gains I just discussed are not eroded in real terms and that necessities remain affordable. In addition, it helps individuals and families plan for major purchases, such as a car or home, and for major expenses, including retirement and college.</p>
<p>I want to highlight one of these major expenses&mdash;higher education&mdash;as attending college is an important pathway for upward mobility. Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure7.png" id="fig">figure 7</a>, higher education inflation is shown by the red line. A variety of factors affect the cost of college generally, including student loan costs, state funding, and administrative overhead. Nonetheless, when inflation was low for an extended period during the economic expansion that followed the GFC, we also saw a moderation in the growth of higher education costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of college attendance for mobility, let me&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure8.png" id="fig">return</a>&nbsp;to the rank&ndash;rank intergenerational mobility relationship I showed earlier. As before, the darkest dots show the national child-income-rank-to-parent-income-rank relationship. Now consider how this relationship looks across different types of higher education. The red line shows elite four-year colleges, the green line shows the remaining four-year institutions, and the lighter-blue line shows two-year schools. As you can see from the colored lines, the relationship between family income rank and later-life income rank is weaker&mdash;that is, the slope of the line is flatter&mdash;within each type of college than it is nationally.</p>
<p>The flatter slope indicates that outcomes for children from lower-income families are more similar to outcomes for children from higher-income families within each college type than they are overall. In this way, higher education is an important source of upward mobility for many youths and a pathway to a more secure financial future. Of course, the relatively steeper national relationship holds because there are meaningful differences in college enrollment over the family income distribution.</p>
<p>Going back to my initial question, I asked whether meeting the dual mandate facilitates economic mobility. I think that achieving the dual mandate sets the conditions for all individuals to succeed, including those moving up the economic ladder. The evidence suggests that long noninflationary expansions are associated with narrower gaps in employment and earnings, and that lower-wage and less-educated workers benefit disproportionately from sustained periods of strong economic growth. Further, achieving price stability allows individuals and households to plan for and make investments in human capital, such as attending college, that may allow individuals to move up the income distribution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p><span>Does Economic Mobility Matter for the Conduct of Monetary Policy?</span><br />Before I conclude, I want to return to my second question: Does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy? As I mentioned earlier, economic mobility is not part of the Federal Reserve's mandate, and our monetary policy tools are blunt instruments for affecting economic mobility. For example, interest rates affect the entire economy, not targeted populations, and rate changes operate through financial markets rather than directly influencing labor market outcomes.</p>
<p>One way that economic mobility could matter for the conduct of monetary policy is if the goals of monetary policy are easier to achieve in a high-mobility society compared with one with low mobility. I do not know if this is true, but let me offer some conjectures. I think that a society with relatively higher mobility may allow for more efficient transmission of monetary policy. In a dynamic economy with relatively more upward mobility, individuals may have greater incentives to be proactive in the job market. They may seek new and better job opportunities, which could allow for a quicker path to maximum employment following economic downturns. Further, individuals and households may hold additional savings for increased investments in human capital when mobility is relatively higher, allowing for more effective transmission of monetary policy. Stepping back, I pose this question not to offer a definitive answer, but rather to serve as one potential starting point for your discussions here today.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />Let me conclude by pointing out that the patterns we observe in our economy, including those for economic mobility, are not predetermined. Outcomes can and will change as we learn more about effective strategies to improve and maintain economic mobility in the U.S. By joining in these conversations here today, and by continuing to research and describe the patterns of economic mobility, you are helping society understand the dynamics of our economy better and find new and innovative ways to help keep the American dream of economic mobility alive and well. Thank you.</p>

<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Nominal wages in the figure are measured by the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker. Series show 12-month moving averages of the median percent change in the nominal hourly wage of individuals observed 12 months apart. Workers are assigned to wage quantiles based on the average of their wage reports in both the Current Population Survey and outgoing rotation group interviews. Workers in the lowest 50 percent of the average wage distribution are assigned to the bottom half, and those in the top 50 percent are assigned to the top half.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. There are limitations to this measure of higher education costs, as it is volatile and may not reflect the underlying net price that students pay. However, list tuition prices have been shown to be salient for many families when making college enrollment decisions. For example, see Bleemer and Zafar (2018).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. Despite the rising cost of college, research consistently shows a positive return to higher education for most students. See Wolla, Vandenbroucke, and Tucker (2023), Autor (2014), Zimmerman (2014), and Card (1999).&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, today announced that Bowmoor Capital, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">London</span>-based global macro investment advisor, and SummerHaven Investment Management, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Connecticut</span>-based commodity-focused asset management firm, have deployed the new TT Futures TCA solution to inform their trade execution and algorithmic trading strategies and ensure they are achieving best execution on behalf of their clients.</p>
<p>First introduced last year, TT Futures TCA is a comprehensive transaction cost analysis (TCA) tool for futures trading, leveraging the largest collection of anonymized, aggregated microsecond-level futures market and trade data with a broad array of metrics and measures firms can use to customize the data for their unique purposes. Quantitative hedge funds and asset managers such as Bowmoor and SummerHaven can use the data for refining their strategies as well as for clients to confirm they are achieving best execution when invested in their managed funds.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Peter Weiler</span>, EVP Managing Director, Data &amp; Analytics at TT, said: "We're offering clients an unprecedented level of granularity on the wealth of futures trading data that's aggregated and anonymized by TT. It's great to see Bowmoor and SummerHaven applying these important analytical tools to their highly sophisticated trading and algo strategies, as well as to report to their clients how they are keeping costs low to maximize their returns."</p>
<p>Bowmoor Capital CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Richard Liddle</span>&nbsp;said: "We are honored to strengthen our longstanding relationship with Trading Technologies through this exciting new partnership. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in our commitment to innovation, leveraging advanced technology to enhance execution capabilities through the TT Futures TCA tools while driving the growth of our fund. We look forward to the transformative impact this project will have on our operations and the broader trading landscape."</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Kurt Nelson</span>, SummerHaven Co-Founder and Managing Partner, said: "We immediately saw the value of TT Futures TCA when the TT team demonstrated it. This is a valuable tool in our quest to achieve best execution for our clients, and this has traditionally been much harder to verify in futures than in equities."</p>
<p>TT Futures TCA is part of the firm's Data &amp; Analytics business, which builds on TT's 2023 acquisition of Abel Noser Solutions. In January, the firm launched TT Broker Scorecard, a first-of-its-kind monthly report ranking global and regional equity brokers by liquidity and execution quality. The report provides an independent proxy of the institutional market with rankings derived from the aggregated, anonymized trade data compiled by Abel Noser Solutions. The product will soon be available for futures.</p>
<p>TT Futures TCA includes depth-of-market views &ndash; important to futures market participants as they can assess their costs for trade execution vis a vis clearing costs. In the second quarter, the offering will also include futures pre-trade cost estimates based on extensive empirical data used to predict outcomes under similar market conditions based upon results from traders executing in similar contract sizes, types and market volatility.</p>
<p>Last year, Abel Noser Solutions won the Editors' Choice Award for TCA Provider of the Year in The TRADE's inaugural Leaders in Trading New York Awards as well as the award for Best Buy-Side TCA Tool in WatersTechnology's Buy-Side Technology Awards 2024.</p>

<title>ACER To Decide On The National Flexibility Needs Assessment Methodology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 16 April 2025, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) submitted to ACER a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUlJUWQRdBUwJBwNaHVZbUVMdUw0FBxpRVlUPA1BQVlRUDlUdBAZWVwhSB1QdVg5XVx0GAQEDGgxcAw4ZAQdRU1JSUFZWUwJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">joint proposal on the national flexibility needs assessment methodology</a>. The proposal defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the methodology for analysing national flexibility needs in electricity systems; and</li>
<li>the type of data to be gathered by system operators and in what format.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why national flexibility assessments matter</span></p>
<p>The national flexibility needs assessments aim to support Member States in identifying their indicative national targets for non-fossil flexibility (e.g. storage, demand response), ensuring their electricity systems remain secure and efficient during the energy transition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER has three months, until 16 July 2025, to approve or amend the system operators&rsquo; proposal. Once approved, the methodology becomes binding for national assessments. Based on the national assessments (to be delivered by the national designated entities by July 2026), the Member States must set their national non-fossil flexibility targets within 6 months (by January 2027).</p>
<p>ACER will then review the national reports (by July 2027) and may provide recommendations on issues of cross-border relevance (including on removing barriers) to ensure sufficient non-fossil based flexible capacity is in place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How does it link to the EU-wide flexibility assessment?</span></p>
<p>In parallel, to complement the national assessments, ACER is working on an EU-wide flexibility needs assessment, which will be published by July 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3rd edition of DFM&rsquo;s flagship Capital Market      Summit returns to Dubai on May 6-7, 2025, bringing together top international      and regional financial leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Summit will explore key trends shaping global      capital markets and the future readiness of markets amid evolving      financial dynamics.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>Over 1,500 participants, 100+ global speakers,      and 200 industry partners will convene at the region&rsquo;s leading capital      markets event to drive opportunity, growth, and future-ready strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dubai Financial Market (DFM) announced the agenda and speaker line-up for the upcoming 3rd MENA Capital Market Summit, which will take place on 6&ndash;7 May at Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai.</p>
<p>The 2025 edition will focus on the forces shaping global and regional capital markets, with sessions exploring the impact of technology on market infrastructure, IPO trends and high-growth company pipelines, cross-border capital flows, the rise of retail investors and the ongoing transformation of private markets.</p>
<p>These themes will be addressed by over 100 senior market leaders, including <b>H.E. Helal Saeed Almarri</b>, Director General of Dubai&rsquo;s Department of Economy and Tourism and Chairman of DFM; <b>Ken Robins</b>, Head of EMEA Equity Capital Markets at Citi; <b>Richard Cormack</b>, Head of ECM and Convertibles in EMEA and Co-Head of UK Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs; and <b>Simon Williams</b>, Chief Economist CEEMEA at HSBC, and <b>Lord Stephen A. Carter,</b> Group Chief Executive, Informa PLC. The programme includes keynote speeches, panel discussions and sector-specific sessions featuring speakers from across financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and government, and is expected to convene over 1,500 participants, and around 200 industry partners.</p>
<p>As Dubai continues to solidify its position as a global financial hub, the Capital Market Summit Series serves as a vital space for collaboration, policy dialogue, and deepening regional and international investment ties. With a growing IPO pipeline, rising investor participation, and rapid fintech advancements, the Summit plays a strategic role in driving market development and ensuring the future readiness of capital markets.</p>
<p>In addition to the main agenda, this year&rsquo;s Summit will introduce The Hub, a new dynamic space designed to foster practical engagement and focused dialogue. It will host partner presentations, fireside chats and panel discussions, alongside demonstrations of DFM&rsquo;s investor platforms, including the iVestor App and ARENA. The Hub will also feature sessions led by DFM and its partners, offering insights into the services shaping Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets today as well as the future initiatives designed to drive continued market growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Similar to last year, the Summit is supported by Platinum Sponsors &ndash; Bank of America, Citi, Emirates NBD and HSBC &ndash; with senior executives from each institution contributing to the programme.</p>
<p><b>Andree Chakhtoura</b><b>, Head of Investment Banking MENA, Bank of America, said</b>: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets continue to grow in scale and sophistication, creating new opportunities for both issuers and investors. As a long-standing partner to the region, we&rsquo;re proud to support the Capital Market Summit and engage in forward-looking conversations on market development, innovation, and the future of global investment flows. This year&rsquo;s Summit reflects a maturing regulatory landscape, increased participation, and deeper access to capital&mdash;marking a pivotal moment in the region&rsquo;s integration into global markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Achintya&nbsp;Mangla, Citi&rsquo;s Head of Financing for Investment Banking, said: </b>&ldquo;We are pleased to continue our partnership with the Dubai Capital Market Summit this year. Dubai continues to stand out as one of the most vibrant markets globally, offering strong growth and investment opportunities. As a trusted partner in key landmark transactions, we are dedicated to supporting the UAE&rsquo;s evolving financial landscape and strengthening investor engagement. This Summit is an important platform to share insights on IPOs, Capital Formation, and the evolution of markets, and we are proud to play a role in driving that dialogue forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Al Qassim, Group Head of Wholesale Banking, Emirates NBD</b>, said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit is firmly established as one of the premier events on the banking and financial services calendar. The 2025 edition is another important opportunity to leverage Dubai&rsquo;s evolving position as a major hub for international banking services, diverse investment, and the integration of the latest digital technologies. Our participation, and ongoing support, for CMS reflects Emirates NBD&rsquo;s role at the forefront of a rapidly changing investment landscape and an opportunity to showcase to an influential and innovative global audience the successes that continue to drive markets in Dubai, across the region, and beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mohamed Al Marzooqi, CEO, HSBC Bank Middle East, UAE, said: </b>&ldquo;International investors are increasingly looking towards the UAE and the Middle East for long term growth. The country&rsquo;s deepening capital markets, and strong international connectivity are driving expansion and creating new opportunities. At HSBC we continue to play a key role in the development of the country&rsquo;s equity and debt capital markets. Of the c.USD26.2 billion raised in IPOs in the UAE&rsquo;s financial markets between 2022&ndash;2025, HSBC was involved in 65% of total deal value. As the direction of global capital shifts eastwards, the Dubai Financial Market Summit acts as an essential platform for fostering collaboration, innovation, and unlocking new opportunities that will shape the future of financial markets across the Middle East.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming edition builds on a period of steady growth and heightened regional activity, while also reflecting the broader evolution of market expectations. With greater participation, maturing regulatory frameworks, and expanding access to capital, the Summit offers an opportunity to take stock of where the region stands &ndash; and where it&rsquo;s headed &ndash; in the context of a more connected global market.</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of DFM and Nasdaq Dubai,</b> said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a global financial gateway, where international capital meets regional opportunity. With AED 10.48 billion raised through IPOs in 2024 and an investor base of 1.2 million participants from over 200 nationalities, we&rsquo;re seeing clear evidence of growing global confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets. This momentum reflects the strength of our financial ecosystem and the clarity of our long-term vision: to scale access, drive innovation, and lead the region in capital market development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>''The third Capital Market Summit this year arrives at a pivotal time for our region, as global markets adapt to evolving economic dynamics, technological disruption, and shifting investor behavior. The 2025 edition will convene a broad spectrum of market leaders to explore how innovation, cross-border collaboration, and regulatory evolution can unlock new opportunities for capital formation and investment. I&rsquo;m particularly looking forward to the exchange of ideas and perspectives that will emerge &ndash; insights that will inform how we evolve, adapt, and lead in a fast-changing financial landscape.''&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Iress (ASX:IRE) today announces it has entered into a binding share sale and purchase agreement to divest its European headquartered low-latency market data business, QuantHouse, to BAHA Tech Holding AG (BAHA). BAHA is a privately-owned, Vienna-based market data provider founded in 1995. It provides real-time market data, financial news, technology and solutions for the financial services industry covering over 12 million financial instruments on more than 150 exchanges.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The decision to divest the QuantHouse business follows a strategic review Iress conducted as part of its transformation program. The review determined that Iress was not the natural owner of QuantHouse, and it would perform better under renewed ownership with the capacity and intent to invest in delivering specialist market data offerings at scale to global clients. Iress will retain its traditional market data offering as part of its Trading &amp; Market Data business.</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA is to pay Iress &euro;17.5m (A$31.4m) in cash consideration before costs upon completion, subject to customary working capital adjustments, warranties and indemnities. As part of the transaction, Iress has also agreed to a five-year supply agreement with BAHA to provide existing QuantHouse market data feeds into Iress&rsquo; software.</span><br /><br /><span>Completion of the sale is subject to BAHA ensuring it has the necessary market data agreements in place to ensure seamless continuity of service to QuantHouse clients. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed by the end of the year. Following completion, Iress will continue to provide certain services for a period of up to 12 months to assist in the transition to BAHA&rsquo;s ownership.</span><br /><br /><span>Iress Group CEO, Marcus Price, said: &ldquo;With our transformation program now complete, Iress is focused on strengthening and growing our core business operations in Wealth and Trading &amp; Market Data. While QuantHouse has been a valuable part of our business, we recognise its future potential will be best realised with an owner committed to investing in its global expansion.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are delighted that BAHA shares this vision and is the ideal owner to support QuantHouse in its next phase of growth. This transition represents an exciting opportunity for clients and employees, and we are committed to ensuring a seamless handover and continued collaboration in the future.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA founder and President Christian Baha, said: &ldquo;We welcome the QuantHouse team as a new part of the BAHA family. QuantHouse will continue to operate under its strong brand as an independent unit.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The BAHA offering now includes a comprehensive portfolio of high-end institutional information services including the BAHA terminal workstation, an independent proprietary global newswire, a leading consolidated global data feed and high-quality time series data sets critical for back testing and compliance requirements.</span><br /><br id="isPasted" /><span>&ldquo;Combined with QuantHouse, which has built an excellent reputation as a pioneering provider of low latency real-time market data for over 21 years, we look forward to expanding together as an innovative company that will revolutionise the high-end institutional financial market.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>This announcement was authorised by the Iress Board.</span></p>

<title>KB Asset Management To Launch KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF Tracking The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to continue its partnership with KB Asset Management with the upcoming launch of KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF, tracking the Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index. This ETF offers investors a comprehensive approach to the US natural gas sector, providing exposure to companies operating across the entire natural gas value chain, from production to infrastructure and export.</strong></p>
<p>As natural gas plays an increasingly central role in the global energy transition, the sector continues to attract the attention of investors worldwide. In 2024, global gas demand is expected to increase by approximately 2.8%, significantly outpacing the average growth rate for the decade, driven primarily by rising consumption in Asia. With long-term LNG demand bolstered by global energy security concerns and decarbonization efforts, investment in gas infrastructure, such as pipelines and LNG terminals, has accelerated. The United States has made decade-long investments in LNG facilities, reaffirming the strategic importance of natural gas in energy portfolios.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/kb-asset-management-to-launch-kb-rise-us-natural-gas-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-us-natural-gas-value-chain-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0P1U2">Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</a></strong>&nbsp;aims to capture the dynamic structure of this sector by identifying US-listed companies operating in three main categories: Production, Infrastructure, and Export. The companies are selected from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SLA3512">Solactive GBS North America All Cap Index</a></strong>&nbsp;and filtered according to strict liquidity and market capitalization criteria. Using ARTIS&reg;, Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing technology, the index ranks companies according to their relevance to each segment. The methodology ensures diversified exposure by selecting the five top-ranked companies per segment and weighting them based on free-float market capitalization, with segment allocations set at 20% for Export, 50% for Infrastructure, and 30% for Production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 22 April 2025 on the Korean Stock Exchange with ticker code 36Z0001.KS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>Our cooperation with KB Asset Management continues to grow. The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index provides investors with timely and relevant exposure to a critical component of the global energy mix by offering targeted exposure to the US natural gas value chain. In response to evolving market trends and investment objectives, we remain committed to providing innovative index solutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soojin Lee, Head of ETF Product Division at KB Asset Management, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It is our pleasure to extend our partnership with Solactive by launching the KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF. The ETF is designed to seek performance in both rising and falling natural gas price environments by structuring the natural gas value chain based on business revenue structures and diversifying across key companies in LNG exports (20%), production (30%), and infrastructure (50%).</em><em>&nbsp;We hope this ETF serves as a valuable tool for investors seeking strategic and balanced exposure to the natural gas industry.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today commenced the third cohort of its Shariah Mentorship Programme (SMP), aimed at nurturing a new generation of Shariah professionals in the Islamic capital market (ICM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event also celebrated 15 graduates of the second cohort of SMP, marking a significant step in the SC&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen Shariah talent development and governance in the ICM.</p>
<p>The SMP, funded by the Capital Market Development Fund (CMDF), was introduced by the SC in 2023. The mentorship initiative is run by ISRA Consulting, wholly owned by INCEIF University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme combines practical knowledge, industry exposure, and mentorship by members of the SC&rsquo;s Shariah Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Each cohort goes through an eight-month programme which includes three months of intensive classroom sessions, followed by five months of industry placements to gain hands-on experience in Shariah advisory within Islamic finance.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said SMP, one of the initiatives under the Capital Market Masterplan 3, will help nurture a sustainable Shariah talent pipeline and build industry capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a structured approach, SMP also aims to support the broader objectives of Maqasid al-Shariah by fostering values of integrity, ethics and sound judgement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are essential for Shariah advisory roles in order to serve the greater good of the market and society.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SC is also looking at the whole ecosystem beyond Shariah professionals to developing the next generation of Shariah scholars and the scope of their work, in order to solidify SC&rsquo;s leadership in this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To date, the SMP has produced 30 alumni where more than 70% of whom are now serving in various Islamic finance institutions. It is anticipated that the alumni will be registered as Shariah advisers with the SC in the next five years.</p>
