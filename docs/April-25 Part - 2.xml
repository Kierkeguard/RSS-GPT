<title>“Charting A Steady Course In A Changing World” – Opening Address By Mr Chia Der Jiun, Managing Director, Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The IMAS Annual Investment Conference 2025 On 23 April 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IMAS EXCO<br />Ms Carmen Wee, IMAS CEO<br />Ladies and Gentlemen<br /><br />1. Good morning. I am delighted to join you today at the 28th IMAS Annual Investment Conference.<br /><br />2. This year&rsquo;s conference theme &ndash; &ldquo;Navigating an Evolving Landscape&rdquo; &ndash; is apt but may be understating the environment we are in today. Fundamental shifts in trade policy and the geo-strategic landscape have led us into a period of heightened uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in financial markets. In this new landscape of uncertainty and volatility, the asset management industry plays an important role in sustaining investor confidence and contributing to the resilience of markets.<br /><br /><span>Role of Asset Management Industry to Manage Uncertainty</span><br /><br />3. Let me focus on 3 areas that the asset management industry can help in:</p>
<p>a. One, build more resilient markets;<br />b. Two, provide products and portfolios that meet investors&rsquo; diversification and retirement needs; and<br />c. Three, support better informed investors.</p>
<p><span>Resilient Markets</span></p>
<p>4. There are several components that contribute towards more resilient markets. Transparency, market integrity and settlement efficiency are fundamental. Regulators have a role in putting these right. Market infrastructure operators also have a role. Trading venues should be liquidity enhancing rather than liquidity fragmenting. Margin requirements should be set at levels that avoid amplifying funding stresses.<br /><br />5. Market participants too play a role. Leverage needs to be deployed carefully to mitigate procyclical deleveraging. To be clear, market functionality has generally remained resilient through stress episodes, including through the sharp market repricing of risks and uncertainty in April. But we are also all aware of episodes where volatility spiked and market functionality deteriorated. In August last year, Japanese equities fell sharply and VIX spiked following the unwinding of leveraged carry trades. Earlier this month, 10-year Treasuries rose 50bps over a short period of time, while the dollar weakened. A commonly heard attribution has been the unwind of leveraged trades. Crowded leveraged trades are vulnerable to changing policy, economic and market conditions. Market resilience is better assured through a diversity of market participants, employing a myriad of strategies which provides depth and two-way flows. Let me give the example of Singapore&rsquo;s FX market, where MAS had sought to foster a diverse ecosystem of market participants to support depth and stability.</p>
<p>a. In FX markets, we made efforts since 2018 via our Foreign Exchange E-Trading (&ldquo;FXET&rdquo;) initiative, to strengthen infrastructure capabilities. This has improved pricing and trade-fill efficiency while reducing latency. Over time, a diverse group of FX players have anchored their matching and pricing engines in Singapore to serve regional market participants. This enhancement of FX capabilities and infrastructure has supported FX price discovery and market functionality in this region during both Business-as-Usual and under stressed periods. Our eFX ecosystem continues to grow well with a diversity of market participants including platforms, banks, real money, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. This has contributed to Singapore&rsquo;s continued growth as a leading FX hub in Asia, with the average daily traded volumes crossing US$ 1 trillion in 2024.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/charting-a-steady-course-in-a-changing-world#1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>6. At this time of heightened uncertainty, MAS is closely watching that Singapore&rsquo;s foreign exchange and S$ money markets continue to function in an orderly manner. We also monitor the functionality of key funding markets in coordination with central banks globally.<br /><br /><span>Products and Portfolios that Meet Diversification and Retirement Needs</span></p>
<p>7. Let me turn to my second point. Asset managers are key to providing fund products that serve the savings and retirement needs for our region. Their products should contribute to portfolio diversification and help investors manage market volatility while investing for the long term. In building and delivering such products,:</p>
<p>a. Asset managers must have in place an effective liquidity and market risk management framework. There is a need to run regular stress testing on your portfolio risks under conditions when volatility spikes and correlations break down. Funds should also stress your ability to handle redemption spikes amidst adverse market movements. Global regulatory bodies such as the FSB and IOSCO have made calls for further enhancements to strengthen the industry&rsquo;s resilience in both normal and stressed market conditions, by reinforcing consistency between the funds&rsquo; investment strategy and liquidity of fund assets, with redemption terms. In line with this, MAS will study the need to review the current framework for liquidity risk management by asset managers, and will engage the industry when ready.<br />b. Product distributors and providers should also ensure that marketing and advertisements are fair and balanced. Marketing should not over-emphasise product features that are not sustainable across a robust range of scenarios. A sudden withdrawal of such product features could cause a loss of confidence and a redemption spike.<br />c. Clear and timely disclosures should be provided to investors, to enable them to make well-informed investment decisions in fast-changing market conditions.</p>
<p>8. To provide retail investors with a wider set of investment choices, MAS is also currently consulting on a framework for private market investment funds for retail investors.</p>
<p>a. Private market investments, such as private equity and infrastructure, generally have longer investment horizons and a differentiated set of risk factors that are different than public market investments. Retail investors may be interested in gaining exposure to this asset class as part of a well-diversified investment portfolio.<br />b. We welcome feedback from all IMAS members as we work towards developing a balanced and risk-calibrated framework that can support the growth of a robust and sustainable market for such retail funds.</p>
<p><span>Support Better Informed Investors</span></p>
<p>9. Third, asset managers support better informed investors, through continued partnership with MAS and the MoneySense community on investor education.<br /><br />10. When MAS launched the national financial education programme MoneySense in 2003, one of its goals was to support consumers in becoming more self-reliant in financial affairs. This was important as consumers needed to exercise their judgement, evaluate the suitability of investments for their own needs, even as more complex and varied products entered the financial markets.<br /><br />11. Over the years, industry associations, including IMAS, community organisations and consumer bodies have been valuable partners. Together, MoneySense&rsquo;s activities and programmes were launched to enhance consumers&rsquo; understanding of financial affairs, whether it is in managing money, insurance protection, or investing and planning for retirement.<br /><br /><span>IMAS&rsquo; Contributions to Industry</span><br /><br />12. Let me say a few words of appreciation for IMAS&rsquo; role in galvanizing the industry.<br /><br />13. I am happy to see IMAS&rsquo; continued efforts to bring partners together to uplift the asset management sector. As I mentioned earlier, IMAS has played an important role in improving public education through your ongoing partnerships with MoneySense, SGX and FundSingapore. IMAS has also contributed efforts towards reskilling and upskilling for industry professionals by developing the iLEARN platform since 2019 as a one-stop platform for relevant training programmes in line with market shifts.<br /><br />14. I am also encouraged to know that IMAS has taken the lead to support its members to deepen expertise in sustainable finance.&nbsp;<span>I am happy today to be part of a significant milestone - the launch of the IMAS Climate Handbook in partnership with Amundi.</span>&nbsp;This practical guide will enable asset managers to integrate climate considerations into risk assessments as well as investment frameworks.<br /><br />15. In closing, as regulator and developer of the asset management industry, we share a common goal with market participants to keep our markets stable and vibrant and to ensure its sustainable growth in the face of global headwinds. MAS will continue to partner with IMAS and its members to build a more resilient, competitive, and innovative asset management ecosystem.<br /><br />16. Thank you and wishing you all a fulfilling Conference ahead.</p>

<title>Transmission of Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At the Heller-Hurwicz Economics Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Juan Pablo. I am delighted to be speaking at the University of Minnesota because, in many ways, this visit feels like a homecoming for me.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I was born right here in Minneapolis, before I moved to Colombia as a young child. My parents told me so many wonderful stories about this area and the university. My father studied for his Ph.D. here at the economics department. He studied under accomplished economists, including Anne Krueger, Leo Hurwicz, John Buttrick, and Ed Foster, the latter of whom is still here as an emeritus professor. The University of Minnesota has made many contributions to the field of economics and has historically had a close relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. So you really are part of the Fed's extended family, and it is an honor to speak with you.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak with you about the transmission of the Fed's monetary policy. I will discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy, then touch on how I monitor its transmission, and, lastly, talk about two elements related to transmission that I evaluate when making monetary policy decisions. Those elements are the long and variable lags of monetary policy and whether its transmission is asymmetric and has changed over time. But before I delve into my primary topic, I would like to start by offering my views on the economic outlook.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />The U.S. economy has grown at a solid pace, with real gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 2.5 percent last year. Activity indicators in the first few months of this year show healthy numbers. Last week, the March retail sales release showed resilient consumption, with positive revisions for January and February numbers. However, measures of household sentiment, such as surveys from the University of Michigan, Conference Board, and Morning Consult, have shown signs of softness, albeit to varying degrees. Many survey respondents report that their views reflect trade policy concerns, though, as we have seen, the exact contours of those policies are still taking shape. Thus, GDP growth for the first quarter, which will be reported next week, may show some moderation relative to what we saw in 2024, although this moderation may be offset by increased purchases front-loading the implementation of tariffs. Financial markets have experienced increased volatility in recent weeks. If financial conditions were to tighten persistently, that could weigh on growth in the future.</p>
<p>The labor market remains solid, but the pace of hiring has eased during this year. In the first quarter, U.S. employers added 152,000 jobs per month, on average, compared with a monthly pace of 168,000, on average, last year. The unemployment rate edged up last month to 4.2 percent, but it is still low and has remained near its current level since last summer. Moreover, initial jobless claims have remained stable at low levels. Those numbers are consistent with other measures indicating that the labor market is broadly in balance.</p>
<p>With respect to inflation, progress has slowed since last summer, and inflation remains above the 2 percent goal. Based on the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) data, the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was estimated to have been 2.3 percent last month and 2.6 percent for the core categories, which exclude food and energy.</p>
<p>I pay careful attention to two subcategories of inflation: first, core goods&mdash;which are goods outside of volatile food and energy products&mdash;and, second, nonhousing market-based services, which are based on transactions and not imputed prices, such as car maintenance and haircuts. Goods inflation was negative in most of 2024&mdash;as was the norm for several years before the pandemic&mdash;but it increased to 0.4 percent in January and February. In March, the CPI and PPI releases pointed to goods inflation decreasing to a still-positive 0.1 percent, which is better news. By contrast, nonhousing market services inflation stayed elevated through March, at an estimated 3.4 percent. That category often provides a good signal of inflationary pressures across all services. As we look ahead, while the long-run level of tariffs is still to be determined, tariffs have moved significantly higher this year. That will likely put upward pressure on prices. For instance, both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations have moved up. Longer-term inflation expectations&mdash;those beyond the next few years&mdash;largely remain well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and I hope they continue in that way.</p>
<p>I am closely monitoring incoming data and the cumulative effects on both sides of our mandate from policies in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. I am also monitoring any risks to the outlook, especially upside risks on inflation or downside risks to employment. Still, I think our monetary policy is well positioned for changes in the macroeconomic environment. Thus, I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable. I remain committed to achieving both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p><span>Overview of Monetary Policy Transmission</span><br />Now turning to the primary topic of my speech, I will first discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy. In this section, I will give some examples from the recent past as a tool for explaining my arguments, but I am not intending to comment further on the latest developments in the economy.</p>
<p>Understanding the transmission of monetary policy starts with understanding how the Federal Reserve uses its policy tools. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adjusts the target range for the federal funds rate, or the rate that banks pay for overnight borrowing. Setting the federal funds rate is the primary means by which the Fed adjusts the stance of monetary policy, among its range of monetary policy tools. In addition to the FOMC directly adjusting the federal funds rate, Fed policymakers' communications about the future path of monetary policy may also result in changes to longer-term interest rates because households' and businesses' expectations about future policy affect the level of interest rates.</p>
<p>Adjustments to the federal funds rate affect a multitude of financial conditions faced by consumers and businesses. For example, changes to the federal funds rate filter through to the interest rates lenders charge for loans to businesses and households as well as to what financial institutions pay in interest on deposits. The current and expected future path of the federal funds rate also affects asset prices, as it changes the relative attractiveness of different investments, such as stocks and real estate. Fluctuations in both interest rates and asset prices affect a household's wealth and a corporation's balance sheet, which can, in turn, affect the terms under which they can borrow.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I have discussed some of the most common ways in which policy is transmitted. There are, of course, other important channels, such as exchange rates and international spillovers, that I will not discuss today. Research suggests that the channels of transmission are extensive and ever evolving.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Consumers and businesses make decisions based on financial conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;For illustrative purposes, let's consider a period when FOMC policymakers view it as appropriate to ease the restrictiveness of monetary policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate over time. The resulting lower interest rates on consumer loans elicit greater spending on goods and services, particularly on durable goods that are often financed. Lower mortgage rates can encourage renters to buy a home by reducing the monthly payment borrowers face and can encourage existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages to free up cash for other purchases. Lower interest rates can make holding equities more attractive, which raises stock prices and adds to wealth. Higher wealth tends to spur more spending, as households tend to consume at least a portion of their increased wealth. Investment projects that businesses previously believed would be marginally unprofitable become attractive because of reduced financing costs, particularly if businesses expect their sales to rise. Expecting a better macroeconomic environment and lower delinquency rates down the road, banks may loosen their lending standards on approving loans for households and businesses. All these decisions support aggregate demand and may put upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>Of course, there are periods when policymakers see it as appropriate to increase the level of restraint placed on the economy by raising the federal funds rate over time. That may occur when policymakers are seeking to lower inflation. Then, the monetary policy effects I just described would be reversed, putting downward pressure on aggregate demand and inflation.</p>
<p><span>Developments in Monetary Policy and Financial Conditions</span><br />Let me now discuss how I view the transmission and the stance of monetary policy during the past few quarters. To be clear, I will not discuss the developments in financial markets over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>In the second half of last year, I gained greater confidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I also wanted to preserve the strength I saw in the labor market. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decision to decrease the target range for the federal funds rate by a total of 1 percentage point during the meetings from September through December. However, even before the Committee began to ease policy, some financial conditions started to ease. This easing can be seen in the Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth index.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;That index, developed by Federal Reserve Board staff, showed easier financial conditions from March 2024. And through January, the demand for loans by households and businesses picked up.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;In the early months of the year, financial conditions, however, remained somewhat restrictive, as borrowing costs continued to be elevated and bank credit moderately tight. Through March, interest rates on short-term small business loans had only edged down since their post-pandemic peak.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Banks stopped tightening lending standards after nine consecutive quarters, but they left standards unchanged in January.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;These financial conditions helped to moderate aggregate demand and aid in moving inflation sustainably toward our 2 percent target.</p>
<p><span>Details of Monetary Policy Transmission</span><br />Monitoring the financial conditions I just described is one important way I evaluate how well the Fed's monetary policy is being transmitted to the rest of the economy. But it is not the only way. I also consider two other elements that play important roles in the transmission of our monetary policy.</p>
<p><em>Timing Matters</em><br />The first element to evaluate is the timing with which monetary policy affects the macroeconomy. The contemporary economics literature uses a variety of statistical models to estimate the effects of what are called monetary policy "shocks." Those are movements in the policy rate that are not explained by estimates of how monetary policy systematically responds to incoming economic and financial data and are not anticipated by the public.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Focusing on the estimated effects of these shocks helps isolate the consequences solely coming from monetary policy actions and communications. One lesson that emerges from this research is that, broadly speaking, it turns out that Milton Friedman's "long and variable lags" concept still holds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;A selection of key studies on the topic estimates that it takes about one to two years for the maximum effects of policy to be observed in economic activity and inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;These long lags in monetary policy affecting the economy point to why it is important for policymakers to anticipate economic conditions as best as possible and try to be proactive about understanding the effects of different shocks to the economy, so they can act quickly when needed.</p>
<p><em>Direction of Travel</em><br />The second element to consider when making decisions related to monetary policy is whether its transmission has been equally impactful during different points in time. For example, credible evidence indicates that contractionary monetary shocks may generally decrease economic activity more strongly than expansionary shocks increase it.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;To understand these asymmetric effects, consider the following illustrative metaphor used by Marriner Eccles, who led the Fed back in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Imagine a string with monetary policy at one end and the economy at the other. Employing tight monetary policy when inflation is rising is like pulling on the string to keep the economy in check&mdash;it works fairly well. But attempting to stimulate the economy with loose policy during a downturn is like trying to push on the string to move the economy&mdash;a more difficult task.</p>
<p>There is evidence of this asymmetry in consumer spending on long-lasting durable goods, such as vehicles and appliances. While an easier monetary policy may lower interest rates and thus stimulate spending on durable goods in the near term, the effects of that policy may be smaller over time, as households may have already purchased durable goods.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;If a family replaces their living room furniture when rates are low, they are unlikely to need a new set of furniture a few years later and thus would not consider how current rates would change their decisions. Thus, during an easing cycle, it is reasonable to suspect that the potency of monetary policy may be somewhat diminished.</p>
<p>Another example of asymmetry can be seen in the transmission of monetary policy to private lending. Board staff research documented strong growth in the period between the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic, fueled by structural factors, such as the attractiveness of the market to borrowers and investors due to its higher customization.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;One implication of this strong growth during this past policy tightening is that monetary policy transmission to private credit markets appeared more muted relative to financing through public credit markets or bank commercial and industrial lending.</p>
<p>By contrast, other factors specific to the recent period likely decreased the potency of monetary policy during the tightening cycle but may increase it during the easing cycle. When the pandemic struck and social distancing was common, many households severely curtailed spending. In addition, a historic level of government transfers boosted household income. This combination led the personal savings rate to soar.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Recent work by Board staff suggests that these excess savings accumulated during the pandemic may have reduced the effects of tighter monetary policy over recent years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;If households are flush with excess cash, they are less likely to respond to elevated interest rates by curtailing demand. Instead, they may have funds to avoid financing or may feel they are able to afford higher monthly payments.</p>
<p>Now, some five years after the pandemic began, these excess savings are exhausted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;This creates an environment in which monetary policy could be having its average effects on the household sector, although we should consider that the financial health of borrowers with lower credit scores has deteriorated meaningfully in recent years and credit card and auto loan delinquencies are now above pre-pandemic levels. For these households, easing monetary policy may have larger effects.</p>
<p>I am closely monitoring all these possible changes in monetary policy transmission across the economy. Also, I am humbly aware that it is difficult for economists to judge the overall effect of monetary policy actions on the U.S. economy in real time.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />To summarize, I see inflation still running above the 2 percent target while the labor market has remained stable. But the economy is facing heightened uncertainty, with upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment. This month, we learned that the tariff increases are significantly larger than previously expected. As a result, the economic effects of tariffs and the associated uncertainty are also likely to be larger than anticipated. It is important for monetary policymakers to broadly examine all available information, including market-based measures, surveys, and anecdotal reports, to understand what is happening in the economy as early as possible because, as I discussed, it takes time for policy to have an impact. As the direction of the economy changes, it is critical to pay close attention to real-time data and to consider the lags and asymmetries of policy transmission to ensure we respond not only to the actual movements on both sides of the mandate, but also to the risks to the economic outlook.</p>
<p>As I observe the economy and consider the appropriate path of monetary policy, I am closely studying how the decisions the FOMC makes are transmitted through the economy. We have learned much about how those transmission channels work and how they may have changed in recent years, and there is much more to learn. I am confident some of that research will be done right here at the University of Minnesota. Overall, of course, when setting policy, I am guided by how best to achieve the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices given to us by Congress because that results in the best outcomes for all Americans.</p>

<title>SEC Charges PGI Global Founder With $198 Million Crypto Asset And Foreign Exchange Fraud Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ramil Palafox for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that raised approximately $198 million from investors worldwide and for misappropriating more than $57 million of investor funds.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Palafox&rsquo;s company, known as PGI Global, claimed to be a crypto asset and foreign exchange trading company. From January 2020 through October 2021, Palafox offered and sold PGI Global &ldquo;membership&rdquo; packages, which he claimed guaranteed investors high returns from PGI Global&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset and foreign exchange trading and offered members multi-level-marketing-like referral incentives to encourage them to recruit new investors. However, as the complaint alleges, Palafox misappropriated more than $57 million in investor funds to buy Lamborghinis, items from luxury retailers, and for other personal expenses. He also used the majority of the remaining investor funds to pay other investors their purported returns and referral rewards in a Ponzi-like scheme until its collapse in late 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds,&rdquo; said Scott Thompson, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;We will continue to investigate and take action against bad actors who take advantage of investors with promises of guaranteed passive income and other lies and deceit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palafox used the guise of innovation to lure investors into lining his pockets with millions of dollars while leaving many victims empty-handed,&rdquo; said Laura D&rsquo;Allaird, Chief of the Commission&rsquo;s new Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. &ldquo;In reality, his false claims of crypto industry expertise and a supposed AI-powered auto-trading platform were just masking an international securities fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, charges Palafox with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions preventing Palafox from participating in multi-level-marketing programs involving the offer or sale of securities and offerings of crypto assets bought or sold as a security, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names BBMR Threshold LLC, Darvie Mendoza, Marissa Mendoza Palafox, and Linda Ventura as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, Palafox was arraigned in U.S. District Court on criminal charges brought by the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Michael Cuff and Polly Hayes of the Philadelphia Regional Office and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC&rsquo;s Market Abuse Unit. It is being supervised by Ms. D&rsquo;Allaird and Mr. Thompson. The litigation will be conducted by Spencer Willig and Gregory Bockin of the Philadelphia Regional Office and Eugene Hansen of SEC Headquarters. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office, the FBI, and the IRS.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy directs investors to resources on detecting and avoiding pyramid schemes posing as multi-level marketing programs.

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Research Uncovers Concerns About Finfluencers’ Power Of Persuasion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission&rsquo;s (OSC) latest research report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-research-and-reports/social-media-and-retail-investing-rise-finfluencers"><em>Social Media and Retail Investing: The Rise of Finfluencers</em></a>, found social media finfluencers have considerable influence on retail investors&rsquo; decision making.</p>
<p>Financial influencers (&ldquo;finfluencers&rdquo;) use their social media platforms to share finance and investing insights. Some finfluencer messaging includes sharing posts about their recent successful stock picks, making claims about their own financial successes and emphasizing the limited availability of an investment opportunity.</p>
<p>An OSC survey of 655 Canadian retail investors found that about 35% of respondents reported making a financial decision based on advice from a finfluencer. Financial advice on social media is appealing because retail investors perceive it to be accessible, free, and informative.</p>
<p>While retail investors believe finfluencers are generally motivated by self-interest, about 40% of investors believe that the finfluencers they follow are trustworthy. Those who have made a financial decision based on finfluencer advice were seven times more likely to trust finfluencers they follow.</p>
<p>Relatedly, those who have made a financial decision based on finfluencer advice were also 12 times more likely to have been scammed on social media. The results suggest that those who trust and follow the advice of finfluencers may be more vulnerable to social media scams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finfluencers have a clear capacity to affect their audience&rsquo;s behaviour, and this influence could diminish retail investor well-being &ndash; especially if the advice is poor quality,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;Our findings reaffirm the importance of understanding how finfluencer content affects retail investor behaviours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also details an online experiment with 1,465 Canadian social media users (both investors and non-investors), which assessed the impact of finfluencers and strategies to combat misinformation. Participants were exposed to social media posts promoting a particular asset during an online trading simulation. The posts resembled the type of content found on Reddit, X and YouTube.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% of participants exposed to finance-related social media posts purchased the promoted assets, compared to about 10% of those not exposed. Non-investors were more likely to be influenced by social media posts compared to those already in the market.</p>
<p>Several interventions used to reduce the persuasiveness of social media content were effective &mdash; however, they did not eliminate the impact of social media messaging entirely.</p>
<p>The OSC collaborated with The Decision Lab to explore the relationship between Canadian retail investors and non-investors and the financial information they encounter on social media.</p>
<p>For more information about finfluencers, investor protection and behavioural science, visit&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">GetSmarterAboutMoney.ca</a>&nbsp;<span>and sign up for the OSC e-newsletter,&nbsp;</span><a class="ext" href="https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/investor-news/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Investor News<span>&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><span>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a><span>.</span></p>

<title>Note To SEC Staff: Thank You And Welcome Chairman Atkins - SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear SEC Colleagues,</p>
<p>Sometimes, life comes full circle. In October 2006, I joined the Commission as counsel to then-Commissioner Paul S. Atkins. One of his other counsels was Hester Peirce. Today, I take great pride in seeing Paul sworn in as the next Chairman of the Commission.</p>
<p>Now, the transition set in motion by the voters last November is complete. It has been an honor to serve as your Acting Chairman since President Trump signed my designation three months ago.</p>
<p>At the outset, I asked for your patience as we worked to respond and implement the new directions and executive orders from President Trump. I am grateful that you gave it to me.</p>
<p>During the last three months, you have worked hard to advance our mission. At the same time, we bid farewell to many colleagues who opted to retire or otherwise leave the Commission.</p>
<p>We have accomplished many things since January. We established the Crypto Task Force and withdrew enforcement actions in registration-only crypto cases. We replaced SAB 121 and held public roundtables on what regulation of crypto should look like. We provided guidance, including updates to Schedule 13G eligibility, changed FAQs for the Advisers Act marketing rule, and issued Staff Legal Bulletin 14M on shareholder proposals. We removed personally identifiable information from the Consolidated Audit Trail.</p>
<p>We dropped our defense of the climate rule and withdrew the appeal of the dealer rule. We extended certain compliance dates where needed to avoid market disruption, such as the clearing of U.S. Treasury securities. We successfully oversaw the markets during periods of record-breaking trading activity. We resumed having in-person Commission meetings and managed the return to office.</p>
<p>None of these accomplishments could have been done without your efforts. I also want to recognize the contributions of the Division and Office leaders as well as my personal staff in the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s office. Thank you.</p>
<p>I look forward to returning to my regular role as a Commissioner and working on behalf of investors, issuers, and market participants. See you around!</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. Singleton, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is great to be back in Philadelphia, and I look forward to today's discussions on economic mobility.</p>
<p>As monetary policymakers, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee do not have direct control over economic mobility in the U.S. Our key monetary policy tools are not designed to address this issue, nor is economic mobility part of our mandate. However, our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability has implications for a wide range of economic outcomes, including economic mobility. This leads to many important questions about the relationship between the dual mandate and economic mobility. In my remarks, I want to address two such questions. First, does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? And second, does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy?</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-slide2.png" id="fig1">today's talk</a>, I will discuss my views on these questions, but I will not be able to provide definitive answers. Rather, I hope that posing these questions and relaying some of my own thoughts will lead to further discussions during this conference and beyond. Before turning to these questions, let me start with a brief overview of intergenerational mobility in the U.S.</p>
<p><span>Taking Stock of Economic Mobility</span><br />Economic mobility, the ability to move up the economic ladder, is at the heart of the American dream. We tell our children that in the U.S., if you work hard and play by the rules, you can have a secure and successful financial future no matter where you start. We continue to believe strongly in this part of the American dream and remain optimistic that hard work is a primary determinant of later-life success. In a survey from 2019, when respondents were asked which factors are essential or very important to getting ahead in life, nearly 90 percent identified hard work, and only 30 percent indicated coming from a wealthy family.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Policymakers have long been aware of the importance of economic mobility. To illustrate that, let me share a quote from former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke: "Equality of economic opportunity appeals to our sense of fairness, certainly, but it also strengthens our economy. If each person is free to develop and apply his or her talents to the greatest extent possible, then both the individual and the economy benefit."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>With these sentiments of what Americans and policymakers think and feel about mobility in mind, let me turn to some evidence on economic mobility in the U.S. One common way to measure economic mobility is to relate an individual's income in adulthood to their family income during childhood. The measure I am showing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure1.png" id="fig">here</a>&mdash;from Harvard economist Raj Chetty and coauthors&mdash;is likely familiar to many of you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It shows a relative intergenerational mobility measure, also known as the "rank&ndash;rank" relationship. This measure relates a child's ranking in the income distribution as an adult, shown on the vertical axis, to the child's family income rank during childhood, shown on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>The upward slope of the line implies that children born into lower-income families tend to be lower on the income distribution as adults. For example, a child born to the richest parents is, on average, 30 percentage points higher in the income distribution as an adult compared with a child born to the poorest parents. This difference in the relative standing in the income distribution as an adult translates into meaningful differences in earnings levels. To put this in perspective, consider two children who grow up to be 30 percentile points apart on the earnings distribution as adults, with one at the 80th percentile and the other at the 50th percentile. The child who grows up to be at the 80th percentile of the distribution as an adult will earn roughly twice as much compared with the child at the 50th percentile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>In addition to having lower earnings as adults, children born into lower-income families are more likely to experience outcomes that can negatively affect their success in the labor market later in life. Girls born into the bottom decile of the family income distribution are about 10 times more likely to become teenage mothers compared with those born to top-decile families.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Boys born into bottom-decile families are roughly 20 times more likely to be incarcerated in their thirties compared with boys from families in the top decile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Teen pregnancy and incarceration are extreme examples of barriers to labor market success that differentially affect children from lower-income families. More generally, there are numerous reasons that any individual may struggle in the labor market, including skill mismatches and lack of proper training or education.</p>
<p><span>Does Meeting the Dual Mandate Facilitate Economic Mobility?</span><br />Now, let me turn to the Fed's dual mandate and discuss how working toward maximum employment and price stability helps set the stage for broad-based success generally, and how this may provide favorable conditions for upward mobility.</p>
<p>Consider my first question: Does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? To help answer this question, I want to revisit remarks I delivered earlier this year about the implications of noninflationary expansions on shared prosperity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Specifically, I am reflecting on the economic expansion that followed the 2007&ndash;09 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). During that period, the economy expanded for 128 consecutive months, making it the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.</p>
<p>As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure2.png" id="fig">figure 2</a>, the aggregate unemployment rate fell steadily from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 3.5 percent in September 2019, the lowest level recorded in nearly 50 years. The labor market in this period was remarkable in terms of broad-based gains seen across demographic groups, which contributed to a historic narrowing of employment differentials. To illustrate this point, let's add in unemployment rates by levels of education, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure3.png" id="fig">figure 3</a>. In 2019, the unemployment rate gaps between workers with less than a high school education, the solid green line near the top of the chart, and those who had attained at least a bachelor's degree, the solid orange line closer to the bottom, were near multidecade lows. Further, the strong pre-pandemic labor market drew many new participants into the labor force, including teens and younger workers whose employment prospects, and even long-term career trajectories, are especially sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These are the types of labor market conditions that the economist Arthur Okun speculated would increase upward mobility.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In a tight labor market, when individuals move up the job ladder, they create openings for newer or less educated workers.</p>
<p>Moving on to earnings,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure4.png" id="fig">figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows that nominal wage growth increased steadily following the GFC. As with gains in employment, the strong labor market was especially beneficial for some groups. To demonstrate that, let's turn to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure5.png" id="fig">figure 5</a>, which shows wage growth for different earnings levels. Wage growth for the bottom half of earners, the dashed red line, started to pick up about five years into the expansion, and by 2017, it was notably stronger compared with that for workers in the top half of the earnings distribution, the solid blue line.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;These differences in wage growth are important. As the bottom of the distribution catches up to higher earners, wage inequality declines. These are also dynamics that can facilitate upward economic mobility.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the second component of the dual mandate, price stability. While some long economic expansions have led to an unwelcome rise in prices, inflation remained low and stable during the economic expansion following the GFC. Indeed, Federal Reserve policymakers were grappling with inflation somewhat below, rather than above, the longer-run 2 percent target, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure6.png" id="fig">figure 6</a>.</p>
<p>Low and stable inflation is important for individuals and businesses for a variety of reasons. It ensures that the nominal wage gains I just discussed are not eroded in real terms and that necessities remain affordable. In addition, it helps individuals and families plan for major purchases, such as a car or home, and for major expenses, including retirement and college.</p>
<p>I want to highlight one of these major expenses&mdash;higher education&mdash;as attending college is an important pathway for upward mobility. Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure7.png" id="fig">figure 7</a>, higher education inflation is shown by the red line. A variety of factors affect the cost of college generally, including student loan costs, state funding, and administrative overhead. Nonetheless, when inflation was low for an extended period during the economic expansion that followed the GFC, we also saw a moderation in the growth of higher education costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of college attendance for mobility, let me&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure8.png" id="fig">return</a>&nbsp;to the rank&ndash;rank intergenerational mobility relationship I showed earlier. As before, the darkest dots show the national child-income-rank-to-parent-income-rank relationship. Now consider how this relationship looks across different types of higher education. The red line shows elite four-year colleges, the green line shows the remaining four-year institutions, and the lighter-blue line shows two-year schools. As you can see from the colored lines, the relationship between family income rank and later-life income rank is weaker&mdash;that is, the slope of the line is flatter&mdash;within each type of college than it is nationally.</p>
<p>The flatter slope indicates that outcomes for children from lower-income families are more similar to outcomes for children from higher-income families within each college type than they are overall. In this way, higher education is an important source of upward mobility for many youths and a pathway to a more secure financial future. Of course, the relatively steeper national relationship holds because there are meaningful differences in college enrollment over the family income distribution.</p>
<p>Going back to my initial question, I asked whether meeting the dual mandate facilitates economic mobility. I think that achieving the dual mandate sets the conditions for all individuals to succeed, including those moving up the economic ladder. The evidence suggests that long noninflationary expansions are associated with narrower gaps in employment and earnings, and that lower-wage and less-educated workers benefit disproportionately from sustained periods of strong economic growth. Further, achieving price stability allows individuals and households to plan for and make investments in human capital, such as attending college, that may allow individuals to move up the income distribution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p><span>Does Economic Mobility Matter for the Conduct of Monetary Policy?</span><br />Before I conclude, I want to return to my second question: Does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy? As I mentioned earlier, economic mobility is not part of the Federal Reserve's mandate, and our monetary policy tools are blunt instruments for affecting economic mobility. For example, interest rates affect the entire economy, not targeted populations, and rate changes operate through financial markets rather than directly influencing labor market outcomes.</p>
<p>One way that economic mobility could matter for the conduct of monetary policy is if the goals of monetary policy are easier to achieve in a high-mobility society compared with one with low mobility. I do not know if this is true, but let me offer some conjectures. I think that a society with relatively higher mobility may allow for more efficient transmission of monetary policy. In a dynamic economy with relatively more upward mobility, individuals may have greater incentives to be proactive in the job market. They may seek new and better job opportunities, which could allow for a quicker path to maximum employment following economic downturns. Further, individuals and households may hold additional savings for increased investments in human capital when mobility is relatively higher, allowing for more effective transmission of monetary policy. Stepping back, I pose this question not to offer a definitive answer, but rather to serve as one potential starting point for your discussions here today.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />Let me conclude by pointing out that the patterns we observe in our economy, including those for economic mobility, are not predetermined. Outcomes can and will change as we learn more about effective strategies to improve and maintain economic mobility in the U.S. By joining in these conversations here today, and by continuing to research and describe the patterns of economic mobility, you are helping society understand the dynamics of our economy better and find new and innovative ways to help keep the American dream of economic mobility alive and well. Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, today announced that Bowmoor Capital, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">London</span>-based global macro investment advisor, and SummerHaven Investment Management, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Connecticut</span>-based commodity-focused asset management firm, have deployed the new TT Futures TCA solution to inform their trade execution and algorithmic trading strategies and ensure they are achieving best execution on behalf of their clients.</p>
<p>First introduced last year, TT Futures TCA is a comprehensive transaction cost analysis (TCA) tool for futures trading, leveraging the largest collection of anonymized, aggregated microsecond-level futures market and trade data with a broad array of metrics and measures firms can use to customize the data for their unique purposes. Quantitative hedge funds and asset managers such as Bowmoor and SummerHaven can use the data for refining their strategies as well as for clients to confirm they are achieving best execution when invested in their managed funds.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Peter Weiler</span>, EVP Managing Director, Data &amp; Analytics at TT, said: "We're offering clients an unprecedented level of granularity on the wealth of futures trading data that's aggregated and anonymized by TT. It's great to see Bowmoor and SummerHaven applying these important analytical tools to their highly sophisticated trading and algo strategies, as well as to report to their clients how they are keeping costs low to maximize their returns."</p>
<p>Bowmoor Capital CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Richard Liddle</span>&nbsp;said: "We are honored to strengthen our longstanding relationship with Trading Technologies through this exciting new partnership. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in our commitment to innovation, leveraging advanced technology to enhance execution capabilities through the TT Futures TCA tools while driving the growth of our fund. We look forward to the transformative impact this project will have on our operations and the broader trading landscape."</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Kurt Nelson</span>, SummerHaven Co-Founder and Managing Partner, said: "We immediately saw the value of TT Futures TCA when the TT team demonstrated it. This is a valuable tool in our quest to achieve best execution for our clients, and this has traditionally been much harder to verify in futures than in equities."</p>
<p>TT Futures TCA is part of the firm's Data &amp; Analytics business, which builds on TT's 2023 acquisition of Abel Noser Solutions. In January, the firm launched TT Broker Scorecard, a first-of-its-kind monthly report ranking global and regional equity brokers by liquidity and execution quality. The report provides an independent proxy of the institutional market with rankings derived from the aggregated, anonymized trade data compiled by Abel Noser Solutions. The product will soon be available for futures.</p>
<p>TT Futures TCA includes depth-of-market views &ndash; important to futures market participants as they can assess their costs for trade execution vis a vis clearing costs.

<title>ACER To Decide On The National Flexibility Needs Assessment Methodology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 16 April 2025, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) submitted to ACER a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUlJUWQRdBUwJBwNaHVZbUVMdUw0FBxpRVlUPA1BQVlRUDlUdBAZWVwhSB1QdVg5XVx0GAQEDGgxcAw4ZAQdRU1JSUFZWUwJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">joint proposal on the national flexibility needs assessment methodology</a>. The proposal defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the methodology for analysing national flexibility needs in electricity systems; and</li>
<li>the type of data to be gathered by system operators and in what format.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why national flexibility assessments matter</span></p>
<p>The national flexibility needs assessments aim to support Member States in identifying their indicative national targets for non-fossil flexibility (e.g. storage, demand response), ensuring their electricity systems remain secure and efficient during the energy transition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER has three months, until 16 July 2025, to approve or amend the system operators&rsquo; proposal. Once approved, the methodology becomes binding for national assessments. Based on the national assessments (to be delivered by the national designated entities by July 2026), the Member States must set their national non-fossil flexibility targets within 6 months (by January 2027).</p>
<p>ACER will then review the national reports (by July 2027) and may provide recommendations on issues of cross-border relevance (including on removing barriers) to ensure sufficient non-fossil based flexible capacity is in place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How does it link to the EU-wide flexibility assessment?</span></p>
<p>In parallel, to complement the national assessments, ACER is working on an EU-wide flexibility needs assessment, which will be published by July 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3rd edition of DFM&rsquo;s flagship Capital Market      Summit returns to Dubai on May 6-7, 2025, bringing together top international      and regional financial leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Summit will explore key trends shaping global      capital markets and the future readiness of markets amid evolving      financial dynamics.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>Over 1,500 participants, 100+ global speakers,      and 200 industry partners will convene at the region&rsquo;s leading capital      markets event to drive opportunity, growth, and future-ready strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dubai Financial Market (DFM) announced the agenda and speaker line-up for the upcoming 3rd MENA Capital Market Summit, which will take place on 6&ndash;7 May at Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai.</p>
<p>The 2025 edition will focus on the forces shaping global and regional capital markets, with sessions exploring the impact of technology on market infrastructure, IPO trends and high-growth company pipelines, cross-border capital flows, the rise of retail investors and the ongoing transformation of private markets.</p>
<p>These themes will be addressed by over 100 senior market leaders, including <b>H.E. Helal Saeed Almarri</b>, Director General of Dubai&rsquo;s Department of Economy and Tourism and Chairman of DFM; <b>Ken Robins</b>, Head of EMEA Equity Capital Markets at Citi; <b>Richard Cormack</b>, Head of ECM and Convertibles in EMEA and Co-Head of UK Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs; and <b>Simon Williams</b>, Chief Economist CEEMEA at HSBC, and <b>Lord Stephen A. Carter,</b> Group Chief Executive, Informa PLC. The programme includes keynote speeches, panel discussions and sector-specific sessions featuring speakers from across financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and government, and is expected to convene over 1,500 participants, and around 200 industry partners.</p>
<p>As Dubai continues to solidify its position as a global financial hub, the Capital Market Summit Series serves as a vital space for collaboration, policy dialogue, and deepening regional and international investment ties. With a growing IPO pipeline, rising investor participation, and rapid fintech advancements, the Summit plays a strategic role in driving market development and ensuring the future readiness of capital markets.</p>
<p>In addition to the main agenda, this year&rsquo;s Summit will introduce The Hub, a new dynamic space designed to foster practical engagement and focused dialogue. It will host partner presentations, fireside chats and panel discussions, alongside demonstrations of DFM&rsquo;s investor platforms, including the iVestor App and ARENA. The Hub will also feature sessions led by DFM and its partners, offering insights into the services shaping Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets today as well as the future initiatives designed to drive continued market growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Similar to last year, the Summit is supported by Platinum Sponsors &ndash; Bank of America, Citi, Emirates NBD and HSBC &ndash; with senior executives from each institution contributing to the programme.</p>
<p><b>Andree Chakhtoura</b><b>, Head of Investment Banking MENA, Bank of America, said</b>: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets continue to grow in scale and sophistication, creating new opportunities for both issuers and investors. As a long-standing partner to the region, we&rsquo;re proud to support the Capital Market Summit and engage in forward-looking conversations on market development, innovation, and the future of global investment flows. This year&rsquo;s Summit reflects a maturing regulatory landscape, increased participation, and deeper access to capital&mdash;marking a pivotal moment in the region&rsquo;s integration into global markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Achintya&nbsp;Mangla, Citi&rsquo;s Head of Financing for Investment Banking, said: </b>&ldquo;We are pleased to continue our partnership with the Dubai Capital Market Summit this year. Dubai continues to stand out as one of the most vibrant markets globally, offering strong growth and investment opportunities. As a trusted partner in key landmark transactions, we are dedicated to supporting the UAE&rsquo;s evolving financial landscape and strengthening investor engagement. This Summit is an important platform to share insights on IPOs, Capital Formation, and the evolution of markets, and we are proud to play a role in driving that dialogue forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Al Qassim, Group Head of Wholesale Banking, Emirates NBD</b>, said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit is firmly established as one of the premier events on the banking and financial services calendar. The 2025 edition is another important opportunity to leverage Dubai&rsquo;s evolving position as a major hub for international banking services, diverse investment, and the integration of the latest digital technologies. Our participation, and ongoing support, for CMS reflects Emirates NBD&rsquo;s role at the forefront of a rapidly changing investment landscape and an opportunity to showcase to an influential and innovative global audience the successes that continue to drive markets in Dubai, across the region, and beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mohamed Al Marzooqi, CEO, HSBC Bank Middle East, UAE, said: </b>&ldquo;International investors are increasingly looking towards the UAE and the Middle East for long term growth. The country&rsquo;s deepening capital markets, and strong international connectivity are driving expansion and creating new opportunities. At HSBC we continue to play a key role in the development of the country&rsquo;s equity and debt capital markets. Of the c.USD26.2 billion raised in IPOs in the UAE&rsquo;s financial markets between 2022&ndash;2025, HSBC was involved in 65% of total deal value. As the direction of global capital shifts eastwards, the Dubai Financial Market Summit acts as an essential platform for fostering collaboration, innovation, and unlocking new opportunities that will shape the future of financial markets across the Middle East.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming edition builds on a period of steady growth and heightened regional activity, while also reflecting the broader evolution of market expectations. With greater participation, maturing regulatory frameworks, and expanding access to capital, the Summit offers an opportunity to take stock of where the region stands &ndash; and where it&rsquo;s headed &ndash; in the context of a more connected global market.</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of DFM and Nasdaq Dubai,</b> said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a global financial gateway, where international capital meets regional opportunity. With AED 10.48 billion raised through IPOs in 2024 and an investor base of 1.2 million participants from over 200 nationalities, we&rsquo;re seeing clear evidence of growing global confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets. This momentum reflects the strength of our financial ecosystem and the clarity of our long-term vision: to scale access, drive innovation, and lead the region in capital market development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>''The third Capital Market Summit this year arrives at a pivotal time for our region, as global markets adapt to evolving economic dynamics, technological disruption, and shifting investor behavior. The 2025 edition will convene a broad spectrum of market leaders to explore how innovation, cross-border collaboration, and regulatory evolution can unlock new opportunities for capital formation and investment. I&rsquo;m particularly looking forward to the exchange of ideas and perspectives that will emerge &ndash; insights that will inform how we evolve, adapt, and lead in a fast-changing financial landscape.''&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Iress (ASX:IRE) today announces it has entered into a binding share sale and purchase agreement to divest its European headquartered low-latency market data business, QuantHouse, to BAHA Tech Holding AG (BAHA). BAHA is a privately-owned, Vienna-based market data provider founded in 1995. It provides real-time market data, financial news, technology and solutions for the financial services industry covering over 12 million financial instruments on more than 150 exchanges.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The decision to divest the QuantHouse business follows a strategic review Iress conducted as part of its transformation program. The review determined that Iress was not the natural owner of QuantHouse, and it would perform better under renewed ownership with the capacity and intent to invest in delivering specialist market data offerings at scale to global clients. Iress will retain its traditional market data offering as part of its Trading &amp; Market Data business.</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA is to pay Iress &euro;17.5m (A$31.4m) in cash consideration before costs upon completion, subject to customary working capital adjustments, warranties and indemnities. As part of the transaction, Iress has also agreed to a five-year supply agreement with BAHA to provide existing QuantHouse market data feeds into Iress&rsquo; software.</span><br /><br /><span>Completion of the sale is subject to BAHA ensuring it has the necessary market data agreements in place to ensure seamless continuity of service to QuantHouse clients. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed by the end of the year. Following completion, Iress will continue to provide certain services for a period of up to 12 months to assist in the transition to BAHA&rsquo;s ownership.</span><br /><br /><span>Iress Group CEO, Marcus Price, said: &ldquo;With our transformation program now complete, Iress is focused on strengthening and growing our core business operations in Wealth and Trading &amp; Market Data. While QuantHouse has been a valuable part of our business, we recognise its future potential will be best realised with an owner committed to investing in its global expansion.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are delighted that BAHA shares this vision and is the ideal owner to support QuantHouse in its next phase of growth. This transition represents an exciting opportunity for clients and employees, and we are committed to ensuring a seamless handover and continued collaboration in the future.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA founder and President Christian Baha, said: &ldquo;We welcome the QuantHouse team as a new part of the BAHA family. QuantHouse will continue to operate under its strong brand as an independent unit.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The BAHA offering now includes a comprehensive portfolio of high-end institutional information services including the BAHA terminal workstation, an independent proprietary global newswire, a leading consolidated global data feed and high-quality time series data sets critical for back testing and compliance requirements.</span><br /><br id="isPasted" /><span>&ldquo;Combined with QuantHouse, which has built an excellent reputation as a pioneering provider of low latency real-time market data for over 21 years, we look forward to expanding together as an innovative company that will revolutionise the high-end institutional financial market.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>This announcement was authorised by the Iress Board.</span></p>

<title>KB Asset Management To Launch KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF Tracking The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to continue its partnership with KB Asset Management with the upcoming launch of KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF, tracking the Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index. This ETF offers investors a comprehensive approach to the US natural gas sector, providing exposure to companies operating across the entire natural gas value chain, from production to infrastructure and export.</strong></p>
<p>As natural gas plays an increasingly central role in the global energy transition, the sector continues to attract the attention of investors worldwide. In 2024, global gas demand is expected to increase by approximately 2.8%, significantly outpacing the average growth rate for the decade, driven primarily by rising consumption in Asia. With long-term LNG demand bolstered by global energy security concerns and decarbonization efforts, investment in gas infrastructure, such as pipelines and LNG terminals, has accelerated. The United States has made decade-long investments in LNG facilities, reaffirming the strategic importance of natural gas in energy portfolios.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/kb-asset-management-to-launch-kb-rise-us-natural-gas-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-us-natural-gas-value-chain-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0P1U2">Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</a></strong>&nbsp;aims to capture the dynamic structure of this sector by identifying US-listed companies operating in three main categories: Production, Infrastructure, and Export. The companies are selected from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SLA3512">Solactive GBS North America All Cap Index</a></strong>&nbsp;and filtered according to strict liquidity and market capitalization criteria. Using ARTIS&reg;, Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing technology, the index ranks companies according to their relevance to each segment. The methodology ensures diversified exposure by selecting the five top-ranked companies per segment and weighting them based on free-float market capitalization, with segment allocations set at 20% for Export, 50% for Infrastructure, and 30% for Production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 22 April 2025 on the Korean Stock Exchange with ticker code 36Z0001.KS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>Our cooperation with KB Asset Management continues to grow. The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index provides investors with timely and relevant exposure to a critical component of the global energy mix by offering targeted exposure to the US natural gas value chain. In response to evolving market trends and investment objectives, we remain committed to providing innovative index solutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soojin Lee, Head of ETF Product Division at KB Asset Management, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It is our pleasure to extend our partnership with Solactive by launching the KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF. The ETF is designed to seek performance in both rising and falling natural gas price environments by structuring the natural gas value chain based on business revenue structures and diversifying across key companies in LNG exports (20%), production (30%), and infrastructure (50%).</em><em>&nbsp;We hope this ETF serves as a valuable tool for investors seeking strategic and balanced exposure to the natural gas industry.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today commenced the third cohort of its Shariah Mentorship Programme (SMP), aimed at nurturing a new generation of Shariah professionals in the Islamic capital market (ICM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event also celebrated 15 graduates of the second cohort of SMP, marking a significant step in the SC&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen Shariah talent development and governance in the ICM.</p>
<p>The SMP, funded by the Capital Market Development Fund (CMDF), was introduced by the SC in 2023. The mentorship initiative is run by ISRA Consulting, wholly owned by INCEIF University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme combines practical knowledge, industry exposure, and mentorship by members of the SC&rsquo;s Shariah Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Each cohort goes through an eight-month programme which includes three months of intensive classroom sessions, followed by five months of industry placements to gain hands-on experience in Shariah advisory within Islamic finance.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said SMP, one of the initiatives under the Capital Market Masterplan 3, will help nurture a sustainable Shariah talent pipeline and build industry capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a structured approach, SMP also aims to support the broader objectives of Maqasid al-Shariah by fostering values of integrity, ethics and sound judgement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are essential for Shariah advisory roles in order to serve the greater good of the market and society.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SC is also looking at the whole ecosystem beyond Shariah professionals to developing the next generation of Shariah scholars and the scope of their work, in order to solidify SC&rsquo;s leadership in this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To date, the SMP has produced 30 alumni where more than 70% of whom are now serving in various Islamic finance institutions. It is anticipated that the alumni will be registered as Shariah advisers with the SC in the next five years.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/paul-s-atkins-sworn-in-as-sec-chairman-2025422/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Paul S. Atkins was sworn into office today as the 34th Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Chairman Atkins was nominated by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 9, 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,&rdquo; said Chairman Atkins. &ldquo;As I return to the SEC, I am pleased to join with my fellow Commissioners and the agency&rsquo;s dedicated professionals to advance its mission to facilitate capital formation; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and protect investors. Together we will work to ensure that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to returning to the SEC, Chairman Atkins was most recently chief executive of Patomak Global Partners, a company he founded in 2009. Chairman Atkins helped lead efforts to develop best practices for the digital asset sector. He served as an independent director and non-executive chairman of the board of BATS Global Markets, Inc. from 2012 to 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chairman Atkins was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as a Commissioner of the SEC from 2002 to 2008. During his tenure, he advocated for transparency, consistency, and the use of cost-benefit analysis at the agency. Chairman Atkins also represented the SEC at meetings of the President&rsquo;s Working Group on Financial Markets and the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Economic Council. From 2009 to 2010, he was appointed a member of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before serving as an SEC Commissioner, Chairman Atkins was as a consultant on securities and investment management industry matters, especially regarding issues of strategy, regulatory compliance, risk management, new product development, and organizational control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1990 to 1994, Chairman Atkins served on the staff of two chairmen of the SEC, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt, ultimately as chief of staff and counselor, respectively.</p>
<p>Chairman Atkins began his career as a lawyer in New York, focusing on a wide range of corporate transactions for U.S. and foreign clients, including public and private securities offerings and mergers and acquisitions.
