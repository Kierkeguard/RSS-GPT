<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>On 27 March 2025, ACER received the TSOs' proposal to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVUwQAWVNdBkwLDgVVHVYIV1MdU18AABoDXQZSBAYEDgECBggdVFwFB1oHDFAdAAoHBB0GCVVXGlRWVVYZUQQGUlMAU1MCB1QHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">harmonised allocation rules</a>.</p>
<p>These rules govern the allocations and auctioning of long-term transmission rights within the European Union. Particularly, they allow market participants to access cross-border hedging opportunities for the integrated EU electricity market and go through a review process every two years.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why are we consulting?</span></p>
<p>To ensure that the harmonised allocation rules continue to respond to changes in the electricity market and evolving operational needs, the TSOs proposal covers various market updates (including the introduction of the 15-minutes market time unit in the day-ahead market) and recent incidents, such as the single-day ahead market decoupling in June 2024.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Share your views!</span></p>
<p>Interested stakeholders can submit their views by 22 May 2025.</p>
<p>ACER will reach a decision by 29 September 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>MG Stover, a pioneer in digital asset financial services since 2014, announced the successful completion of a strategic shift by the sale of its fund administration business to focus on its managed portfolio solutions platform, OTTO.</span><br /><br /><span>Now operating as a fully independent entity, MG Stover is dedicating its efforts on OTTO, a service-backed digital asset platform positioned to lead in the evolving digital asset financial services environment. This transition reflects the company&rsquo;s long-term commitment to innovation and client service. After concluding its relationship with PolySign in 2023, MG Stover strategically expanded its fund services business before entrusting it to Securitize.</span><br /><br /><span>"We spent over a decade building one of the industry&rsquo;s leading and most respected fund administration businesses, and we&rsquo;re proud to have transitioned it in a way that ensures a seamless experience for our clients, supported by the same trusted team,&rdquo; said Matt Stover, Founder and CEO. &ldquo;This step empowers us to focus on where we can now make the biggest impact: providing the industry&rsquo;s most robust, transparent, and service-driven digital asset accounting platform.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>OTTO is backed by a team of professionals who have managed crypto reporting since 2014 and have worked directly with regulators. Unlike traditional software-only tools, OTTO is delivered through a service-first model that pairs real-time reporting and institutional-grade accounting logic with crypto-native support from professionals who understand the regulatory landscape of a 24/7 asset class.</span><br /><br /><span>"We think of OTTO as service-as-a-software, not the other way around," added Stover. "Institutional clients don't just need tools. They need trusted partners who understand the data, the workflow, and the regulatory reporting expectations.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>With a proven track record supporting over $40 billion in digital assets across various fund structures, protocols, and jurisdictions, OTTO&rsquo;s foundation reflects this invaluable experience and expertise. The company is now focused on expanding its team, growing integration partnerships, and scaling OTTO&rsquo;s adoption among institutional clients, capital market participants and centralized platforms.</span><br /><br /><span>Building on this momentum, MG Stover is focused on developing the infrastructure institutions need to manage digital assets at scale. Through continued investment in OTTO and its ecosystem of partners, the firm is shaping a more resilient, transparent, and operationally sound future for the industry.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are not just adapting to change; we are driving it, opening new horizons and redefining what&rsquo;s possible in the financial landscape. As we embark on this exciting journey, MG Stover invites clients and partners to join us in exploring the limitless potential of this new chapter in digital assets,&rdquo; concluded Stover.</span></p>

<title>SustainoMetric Launches Supply Chain Due Diligence To Help Navigate Supply Chain Uncertainty And International Trade Disruption</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sustainometric-launches-supply-chain-due-diligence-to-help-navigate-supply-chain-2025424/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>SustainoMetric, a leading independent provider of high-quality, comprehensive, bespoke sustainability research, analysis and consultancy, today announced the launch of its new Supply Chain Due Diligence service. The new service helps organisations build resilient and truly sustainable supply chains by providing a full, accurate and in-depth analysis of supply networks, producing actionable, data-driven insights to support strategic decision making.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The sweeping global trade tariffs introduced by US President Trump and his administration raise the likelihood of disruptions to global supply chains, making a vital component of the global economy, even more unpredictable and volatile. Companies with global supply chains will need to manage the impact of tariffs as well as the potential impacts on profitability and even business viability. For organisations trying to build or realign resilient supply chains, reliable intelligence to inform due diligence has never been more important.</span></p>
<p><span>But even before these reforms, the impact of the global COVID pandemic, the global semiconductor chip shortage and regional conflicts have all highlighted the fragility of complex, interconnected global supply chains. These factors, coupled with high profile reputational damage to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld-middle-east-68172560/1/0102019666966697-6fb374d0-aae3-4531-906b-f3a7a84fd9de-000000/rJKbbcs7dNCpr-5NDQG6PDx3Q4M=423" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>cosmetics manufacturers</span><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>and corporate cases against&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.ecchr.eu%2Fen%2Fpress-release%2Fdeutscher-wirtschaftsmotor-brummt-dank-zwangsarbeit-beschwerde-gegen-vw-bmw-und-mercedes-benz-eingereicht%2F/1/0102019666966697-6fb374d0-aae3-4531-906b-f3a7a84fd9de-000000/DcjEzKI2D5nao_K7mw5uU6fK5U0=423" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>automotive companies&nbsp;</span></a><span>underscore that supply chain due diligence should be of utmost importance amidst growing uncertainty in the global economic order.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In response, and reacting to client needs, SustainoMetric&rsquo;s offering leverages the latest technology, including AI, with expert human knowledge, experience and analysis firmly at its heart. Together with constant access to interactive expert human support throughout the process, SustainoMetric&rsquo;s Supply Chain Due Diligence service offers organisations comprehensive and reliable insights into supply chains for risk management and compliance purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Commenting on the launch, Mohit Agarwal, Director, Innovation and Strategy of SustainoMetric, said:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;The launch of our new Supply Chain Due Diligence service is a milestone for us and is a direct response to real challenges our clients face every day.&nbsp; It couldn&rsquo;t be more timely, since the recent Global trade wars add significant uncertainty, which will rock global supply chains, forcing many companies to re-examine their supplier bases.&nbsp; More uncertainty means more risk, making it harder for organisations of all types to accurately understand the resilience and consequently the risks associated with the companies they are investing in, or doing business with.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AI is a part of our solution, but fundamentally disagree with reliance solely on AI for such strategically important insights. We also know that clients don&rsquo;t want to just be left to handle a software platform on their own.&nbsp; AI has a role to play in the overall efficiency of our processes, but we rely on the expertise and experience of our highly-trained human analyst base, to ensure the accuracy of assessment, delivering higher-quality interpretation of data and ultimately more useful advice for clients.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re excited to bring these benefits to more of our clients, as well as the wider market, and my thanks go to our wonderful team for their hard work in developing this excellent addition to our existing portfolio of sustainability research and analysis services.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>SustainoMetric&rsquo;s Solution</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Supply Chain Due Diligence solution from SustainoMetric offers a step-change in sourcing and understanding vital information on every element in global supply chains. The service leverages AI and other cutting-edge technologies in areas where they can add value such as data collection, collation and structuring, but crucially, SustainoMetric uses expert human analysis at every stage of the process to ensure accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike many large-scale, highly automated SaaS solutions saturating the current market, SustainoMetric is tailored to meet the needs of mid-cap and small-cap companies&mdash;organisations often overlooked by supply chain providers that primarily target larger corporations. These smaller enterprises benefit from the service&rsquo;s emphasis on real-time guidance from experts at every step, addressing their unique challenges in understanding and managing supply chain risks.</span></p>
<p><span>The offering features high-risk supplier identification, continuous supplier due diligence and monitoring, comprehensive supplier engagement programs, and robust supply chain benchmarking. By addressing critical challenges such as limited visibility into multi-tier supply chains, increasing risks of non-compliance with sustainability and operational resilience regulations, and the complexities of supplier engagement, SustainoMetric enables clients to enhance transparency, streamline risk management, and cultivate more open and sustainable supplier relationships. SustainoMetric demonstrates a deep understanding of supplier needs and fosters collaborative partnerships with supply chains requiring additional support and guidance.</span></p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange: Expanded Product Diversity With New ETFs And Crypto Trackers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>As of today, another hundred ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and around fifty new crypto ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) can be traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The key criteria for the extensive expansion of the ETF offering were index fund volume, international demand and tradability. The expanded offering includes ETFs that track the performance of well-known indices such as the MSCI World, S&amp;P 500 or NASDAQ-100, as well as numerous bond ETFs with different structures. The new additions almost double the number of ETFs so far tradable. Even greater in relation is the increase in crypto ETPs: in the form of a bond, they track the performance of digital assets such as Bitcoin, thus enabling investment in them via regulated financial instruments.</p>
<p>"ETFs reflect the key principles of a solid investment strategy: broad diversification, low costs and the option of a monthly savings plan. They are therefore a prototype for long-term private retirement planning. With our comprehensive product expansion, domestic investors now have an even more diverse investment offering at attractive conditions," says Manuel Kurz, Deputy Head of Member Sales &amp; Business Development.</p>
<p>As market maker, Lang &amp; Schwarz guarantees high price quality and ensures continuous trading. A total of around 240 ETFs and about 60 crypto ETPs are now available on the Vienna Stock Exchange. On the domestic national exchange, investors benefit from favorable conditions without foreign exchange fees and without issue surcharge.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham issued the following statement on the CFTC Office of Inspector General (OIG)&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12031/OIG_GCCAPA041725/download"><span>Audit of CFTC&rsquo;s Compliance with the Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I applaud the diligent work of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of the Inspector General to&nbsp;identify fraud, waste, and abuse in the&nbsp;independent audit of the agency&rsquo;s Government Charge Card programs, including purchase cards and travel cards. The OIG audit did not identify any monetary violations. However, the OIG report and recommendations confirm the CFTC&rsquo;s noncompliance with various requirements for internal policies and employee training&mdash;both issues I have repeatedly raised in the past, including calling for a GAO study&mdash;and instances of noncompliance relating to card deactivation for separated employees, transaction preapproval procedures, and correct interpretation and application of the Federal Travel Regulation, among other issues. &nbsp;This independent audit report will support my efforts to strengthen the CFTC&rsquo;s management accountability and governance, and the CFTC looks forward to completing appropriate corrective action plans.&rdquo;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A Vancouver payment processing company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/-/media/PWS/New-Resources/Decision-and-Orders/Settlement-Agreement-Orders/2025/2025-BCSECCOM-139.pdf" target="_blank">has been ordered</a>&nbsp;to pay more than $3.3 million to the BC Securities Commission (BCSC) after admitting to making misrepresentations, illegally distributing securities and operating an unauthorized exchange &ndash; all of it related to a crypto-asset it created and sold.</p>
<p>The funds will be made available to the investors who lost money as a result of the company&rsquo;s misconduct.</p>
<p>NetCents, which was listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange at the time of the misconduct, created a crypto-asset called the NetCents Coin, which it sold to approximately 500 investors in B.C. and elsewhere from September to December 2017, for total proceeds of $3.3 million.</p>
<p>Although the coin was an investment contract &ndash; and therefore a security &ndash; NetCents did not file a prospectus, which is a formal document providing details of an investment. Without a prospectus, or an exemption from the prospectus requirement, NetCents illegally distributed securities.</p>
<p>NetCents claimed on its website that an independent non-profit organization called the NetCents Coin Organization (NCC Organization) was issuing the coin and would manage the network of nodes for coin transaction authorizations. It also said all proceeds from sales of the coin would remain in the treasury reserve account of the NCC Organization for the benefit of all coin holders.</p>
<p>NetCents maintained another website that purported to represent a non-profit organization, the NetCents Coin Foundation (NCC Foundation) whose mission was to develop, administer, promote and maintain the coins on behalf of its community. The website claimed that two of its key roles were releasing the coins according to a schedule and administering the reserve account.</p>
<p>However, neither the NCC Organization nor the NCC Foundation existed during the distribution period and could not have done any of the things that NetCents claimed it did. Instead, all of the proceeds from sales of the coin went to NetCents.</p>
<p>NetCents posted a news release in late November 2017 claiming that the first two tranches of coin releases had been completely sold out, and that a third tranche was selling. It also said the coin&rsquo;s value had quadrupled. However, neither the first nor second tranches had been sold out before either news release was issued.</p>
<p>NetCents posted a YouTube video that said NetCents had a &ldquo;monthly revenue of $100,000 and growing.&rdquo; But the company&rsquo;s own financial disclosure showed that its revenue for the entire 2017 fiscal year was less than $100,000.</p>
<p>By publishing or issuing the website statements, news releases and YouTube video, NetCents made statements to investors that it knew, or ought reasonably to have known, were misrepresentations under B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>.</p>
<p>NetCents also established an online exchange where customers opened accounts and submitted orders to buy and sell the coins. However, NetCents was not recognized by the BCSC as an exchange, as required by the Act.</p>
<p>NetCents&rsquo;s directors and officers at the time of the misconduct are no longer involved in the company&rsquo;s management.</p>
<p>NetCents is also prohibited under the settlement agreement from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading or purchasing any securities or derivatives</li>
<li>Becoming or acting as a registrant or promoter, and</li>
<li>Engaging in promotional activities by or on behalf of an issuer, security holder or party to a derivative, or another person who would reasonably be expected to benefit from the activity, or on its own behalf.</li>
</ul>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent IMFC-DC Statement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I look forward to this year&rsquo;s Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, and meeting with counterparts as we discuss critical issues facing the global economy and the important role of these institutions.</p>
<p>In the United States, we aim to support a sustained economic expansion that improves the lives of all Americans.&nbsp; The Trump Administration remains focused on driving economic growth supported by private-sector demand, bringing down inflation, controlling federal spending, and restoring fairness in U.S. trade relationships.</p>
<p>I see several opportunities for the IMF and World Bank to serve their membership better and contribute to making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous, with ample opportunities for American citizens and companies to benefit. &nbsp;International Financial Institutions that promote sustainable global economic growth and stability will help the private sector thrive and expand economic opportunities for all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 80 years, we need to restore the foundations of the IMF and World Bank. &nbsp;The United States continues to appreciate the value the Bretton Woods Institutions can provide, but they must step back from the expansive policy agendas that stifle their ability to deliver on their core missions.&nbsp; In the case of the IMF, its core mission remains macroeconomic and financial stability.&nbsp; And for the World Bank, this is poverty reduction and economic growth. &nbsp;For low-income countries in particular, both the IMF and World Bank should promote policy discipline for countries to strengthen their institutions, tackle corruption, and ultimately lay the foundation for sound investment so that they see a future that no longer relies on donor assistance.&nbsp; These economies should instead be driven by job-rich, private sector-led growth and underpinned by fiscal prudence and domestic revenue mobilization.</p>
<p>The IMF plays a key role in the international monetary system, particularly through its core functions of macroeconomic surveillance and lending to members facing balance of payments crises.&nbsp; However, in recent years, the IMF has strayed from its mandate, trying to develop expertise in nearly all global issues and participate in every forum.&nbsp; In doing so, the IMF has overburdened its staff and lost focus on the core macroeconomic issues it was created to address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With global growth prospects weighed down by persistent imbalances, high debt, and low productivity growth, we need the IMF to return to its core mandate through a renewed focus on its areas of expertise, including exchange rate, fiscal, monetary, and financial sector issues.</p>
<p>As part of a return to its core mandate, the IMF must conduct robust analysis and put greater pressure on members to maintain fair and transparent currency practices.&nbsp; We must work together to tackle excess capacity in systemic economies like China and respond to unfair practices.&nbsp; To do so, the IMF needs to step up and provide a frank and evenhanded assessment of policies that hold back domestic demand and generate negative spillovers, harming workers and businesses in other countries.</p>
<p>In lending, the IMF must improve the quality and effectiveness of its programs so that countries exit these arrangements on a stable footing and avoid prolonged dependence on IMF support.&nbsp; To do so, the IMF must renew its emphasis on traditional lending programs that resolve members&rsquo; balance of payments problems in the short term so that countries can quickly exit IMF financial support.&nbsp; As part of this effort, the IMF must shift its focus from lending quantity to program quality and implementation.&nbsp; This means holding countries accountable to program performance and empowering IMF staff to walk away if reform commitment is lacking.</p>
<p>The IMF must also strengthen the implementation of its debt sustainability and transparency policies.&nbsp; For countries in debt distress, I welcome the IMF&rsquo;s leadership in helping to improve the debt restructuring process and its work toward preventing the buildup of unsustainable debt through early, active engagement with countries facing debt challenges, including on debt transparency.&nbsp; But more is needed in this space.&nbsp; I expect the IMF to identify and highlight unsustainable lending practices and to more proactively push recalcitrant bilateral creditors to come to the table to work with borrower countries.</p>
<p>The World Bank plays an important role in helping developing countries grow their economies, reduce poverty, increase private investment, and support private sector job creation, all conditions that enable countries to reduce their reliance on World Bank financing.&nbsp; Moving countries to greater self-reliance must be the goal of the World Bank&rsquo;s efforts as it returns to focusing on its core mandate of poverty reduction and economic growth.</p>
<p>A shift from the World Bank&rsquo;s expansive policy overreach will clear the way for greater focus on foundational objectives that promote market-based economic growth and stability that will engender benefits for the world and the United States. &nbsp;A stronger focus on investments in infrastructure, health, education, and agriculture, and work to strengthen governance, including debt sustainability and transparency, will help reduce fragility and migration pressure and better equip countries to thrive and prosper, ultimately making Americans safer and more secure at home. &nbsp;Private sector-led, job-rich economic growth and market development will also help lay a solid foundation overseas that will attract U.S. exports and investment.</p>
<p>Getting back to basics must also come with greater effectiveness and efficiency through better use of the World Bank&rsquo;s existing resources and maximizing opportunities to mobilize private investment.&nbsp; In that vein, it is past time for the World Bank to start applying its graduation policy, so it can focus its resources on poorer countries rather than crowding out markets or amplifying countries&rsquo; distortionary policy choices.&nbsp; IDA has historically played an important role in poverty alleviation for the poorest countries, but it too must be upgraded to ensure that the IDA program is tightly focused on maximizing the benefits of donor resources for recipients.</p>
<p>Ending energy poverty through a focus on energy access and security is vital for enabling private investment and boosting growth.&nbsp; The World Bank and African Development Bank&rsquo;s joint initiative to expand energy access to 300 million more people in Africa is a welcome contribution to this effort. &nbsp;However, the Bank should be responsive to countries&rsquo; priorities and needs rather than trying to meet poorly defined and arbitrary climate financing targets.&nbsp; This requires adopting an all-of-the-above approach to energy that also includes gas.&nbsp; We applaud recent announcements that the Bank will seek to remove prohibitions on support for nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Effective and efficient support for development also depends on full implementation of policies for transparent procurement based on quality.&nbsp; The World Bank must assist countries in moving toward value-for-money procurement approaches, and away from those focused just on lowest cost bids that reward distortive industrial policies that undermine development, encourage subsidies that stifle the private sector, incentivize corruption and collusion, and result in higher long-term costs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, as the United States and other shareholders seek to rein in fiscal deficits and boost efficiency, we expect the World Bank and IMF to follow suit.&nbsp; Better budget and salary discipline at both institutions will demonstrate that they can walk the talk when it comes to public efficiencies, and will also create space for important investments to upgrade risk management, oversight, and controls to improve these institutions.</p>
<p>Strengthening the IMF and World Bank means a renewed focus on their core missions. &nbsp;The United States stands ready to work with their respective management and staff, as well as other shareholders, to realize these priorities, to the benefit of all our economies.</p>

<title>BIS - Project Promissa: Blockchain For Multilateral Development</title>

<ul>
<li>Project Promissa explored how to manage the financial commitments of member countries to multilateral development banks (MDBs) more efficiently.</li>
<li>The project developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) platform for tokenised promissory notes, which could replace the current paper-based notes and automate many manual processes.</li>
<li>The experiment demonstrated that the PoC is technically feasible and could provide substantial cost savings for MDBs, central banks, and Ministries of Finance alike.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Paragraph">Project Promissa, a collaboration between the Bank for International Settlements' Innovation Hub, the Swiss National Bank, and the World Bank, has demonstrated that paper-based promissory notes can be redesigned using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to address operational challenges that make the process time-consuming and cumbersome.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">A promissory note is a financial instrument that contains a written and signed commitment by one party to pay a specified sum of money to another over a predetermined period.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Since their creation, MDBs like the World Bank and others have used promissory notes to track and encash multi-year financial commitments from member countries in a process that is overly complicated and requires constant reconciliation. The volume of promissory notes across MDBs is significant, representing a substantial portion of contributions pledged by member countries.</p>
<p class="Paragraph">Project Promissa developed a Proof of Concept (PoC) platform for tokenised promissory notes, enabling more efficient management of the notes throughout their lifecycle, from issuance to payment and archiving, thereby automating manual processes and reducing time and costs.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Updates Market On Approach To Climate-Related And Diversity-Related Disclosure Projects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is pausing its work on the development of a new mandatory climate-related disclosure rule and amendments to the existing diversity-related disclosure requirements. This is being done to support Canadian markets and issuers as they adapt to the recent developments in the U.S. and globally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In recent months, the global economic and geopolitical landscape has rapidly and significantly changed, resulting in increased uncertainty and rising competitiveness concerns for Canadian issuers,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, Chair of the CSA and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;In response, the CSA is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2025/04/April-17-CSA-announce-actions-to-support-competitiveness-of-Canadian-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focusing on initiatives</a>&nbsp;to make Canadian markets more competitive, efficient and resilient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climate-related risks are a mainstream business issue and securities legislation already requires issuers to disclose material climate-related risks affecting their business in the same way that issuers are required to disclose other types of material information. The Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) issued their inaugural sustainability standards in December 2024, which are generally aligned with the standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board. The CSSB standards provide a useful voluntary disclosure framework for sustainability and climate-related disclosure that issuers are encouraged to refer to when preparing their disclosures.</p>
<p>With respect to diversity-related disclosure, non-venture issuers will continue to be required to provide disclosure regarding the representation of women on their boards and in executive officer positions based on the existing requirements under National Instrument 58-101&nbsp;<em>Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices</em>.</p>
<p>The CSA will monitor domestic and international regulatory developments with respect to climate-related and diversity-related disclosures and expects to revisit both projects in future years to finalize requirements for issuers. Issuers will be provided with appropriate notice ahead of any changes to the status of these projects. The CSA will continue to monitor disclosure practices of issuers and work to address any misleading disclosure, which can include greenwashing, and will provide information and additional guidance as appropriate.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>Welcoming Remarks, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller, At A Fed Listens Event Hosted By The Federal Reserve Bank Of St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Alberto, it is great to be back in St. Louis. And thank you to everyone here for this great turnout, which is itself a big part of what we are trying to accomplish today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250423a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p><em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;is about hearing from the public on the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy, and that begins with active and broad participation. Your interest and engagement in the work of the Fed is an essential first step in this process of consultation. In addition to the valuable information that Fed policymakers receive at these events, engagement with the public contributes to a broader understanding of the important role that monetary policy plays in the economy.</p>
<p>As we have heard from President Musalem, the Federal Reserve was, in important ways, actually designed to promote this kind of engagement and input from the public. Unusually among agencies of the federal government, the Fed is located in and part of every region of the United States. Reserve Banks such as the St. Louis Fed carry out a number of important functions, but among the most important is ensuring that the concerns and priorities of the communities each Reserve Bank serves are reflected in monetary policy decisions made in Washington.</p>
<p>This is something I know very well, having served here as executive vice president and research director for nearly a dozen years. I advised on monetary policy while engaging with people throughout the Eighth District, hearing their concerns about how they were faring in the economy, and how they were affected by inflation, interest rates, and the state of the job market. I learned a lot about the economies of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas (see, I haven't forgotten!). But I learned just as much about how important it is to hear from people directly about their experiences as well as their perceptions, which are sometimes just as consequential for the economy. We call this part of the "soft" data that supplements the hard numbers of the government statistics that policymakers eagerly await. The "hard" data is indispensable for setting monetary policy, but we can't get a full and detailed picture of the economy without the soft data you can provide.</p>
<p><em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;is directly connected to the Fed's review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy, referred to as our framework, which was last updated five years ago. But in a larger sense, it is part of a broader process of consultation with the public that never stops. We know that individuals, families, businesses, and communities are significantly affected by decisions we make to promote a healthy economy. We want&mdash;in fact, we&nbsp;<em>need</em>&mdash;to know how you have been impacted. We need to know how inflation and interest rates are affecting consumers. We need to know how rates are affecting the cost and access to credit by businesses small and large. We need to know how you expect the economy to evolve over the coming months and years, and how that is influencing your plans for the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I will say again how great it is to be back in St. Louis, and I look forward to hearing from all of you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/">Fiserv</a></span>, Inc. (NYSE: FI), a global leader in payments and financial technology, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire&nbsp;Brazilian fintech Money Money Servicos Financeiros S.A. (&ldquo;Money Money&rdquo;). This transaction expands Fiserv&rsquo;s services in Brazil, enabling small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to access capital that can be invested in the growth and maturation of their businesses.</p>
<p>Money Money operates a specialized financing engine connected to the receivables&rsquo; registry infrastructure regulated by the Brazil Central Bank to provide working capital and other financial solutions to SMBs, based on a robust business analysis. Its technology and expertise in the segment complement Clover's strategy of supporting the development of Brazilian SMBs in their payment, management, and cash flow needs.</p>
<p>With the launch of Clover in Brazil, Clover Capital fueled by Money&nbsp;Money&nbsp;will be integrated with the Clover&nbsp;platform&nbsp;to combine risk analysis technology with the predictive performance of clients&rsquo; businesses to generate personalized offers with competitive rates. The solution advances capital to businesses with a range of payment plans, backed by future receivables based on the merchant&rsquo;s prior sales transactions.</p>
<p>"By adding this service to our portfolio, we take an important step to boost the growth of our acquiring clients, facilitating their access to the necessary resources to invest in improvements and processes,&rdquo; said Jorge Valdivia, General Manager of Fiserv in Brazil. &ldquo;Our continued investment in the Brazilian market demonstrates our commitment to advance our clients&rsquo; business objectives by expanding our local capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clover was first introduced to the Brazilian market in December, offering a differentiated set of capabilities to local businesses that includes an all-in-one payment solution, cash flow support, native applications, and a marketplace of systems and automation tools from the company's leading software partners (ISVs).</p>

<title>DTCC Processes Record Volumes Across Services Amid Market Volatility - NSCC Reaches New Peak Value Of $5.55 Trillion On April 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced significant achievements in handling unprecedented market volatility, showcasing the firm&rsquo;s robust technology infrastructure, resiliency, and risk management capabilities. During the recent market volatility, DTCC reached new peak values and volumes across platforms and services.</p>
<p><span>National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC):</span></p>
<ul>
<li>On April 9, NSCC achieved a new peak value of $5.55 trillion, a 6.4% increase from the previous peak of $5.22 trillion on December 20, 2024.</li>
<li>Additionally, NSCC reached a new peak volume of 545 million transactions on April 7, a 33% increase from the previous peak of 409 million transactions during the &ldquo;meme stock&rdquo; event on January 27, 2021.</li>
<li>Q1 2025 monthly NSCC volume averages were 15% higher than the previous quarter and 29% higher year-over-year.</li>
<li>Fail rates remain consistent with a T+2 environment, as they have since T+1 was introduced in the U.S. in May 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/april/14/ficc-surpasses-usd11-trillion-in-daily-volume-amid-market-volatility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As previously announced</a>, FICC&rsquo;s Government Securities Division (GSD) hit a new peak of over $11 trillion on April 9, successfully processing $11.4 trillion in transactions and representing an 8.88% increase from the prior peak of $10.47 trillion on February 28, 2025.</li>
<li>On April 9, FICC reached a new peak volume of 1.206 million transactions, a 23% increase from the previous peak of 978 thousand transactions on April 7, 2025.</li>
<li>Q1 2025 monthly FICC volume averages were 4% higher than the previous quarter and 32% higher year-over-year.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Institutional Trade Processing (ITP):</span></p>
<ul>
<li>TradeSuite processed 5.8 million transactions on April 7, a 27.7% increase from the previous peak of 4.6 million transactions on March 11, 2025.</li>
<li>CTM processed 3.74 million transactions on April 7, a slight increase from the previous peak of 3.69 million transactions on February 28, 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>DTCC's Technology infrastructure has proven its strength and resilience during periods of extreme market conditions. Given the critical role DTCC plays in protecting the global markets, the organization includes capacity and resiliency as foundational to its design and build processes to ensure its platforms and services can meet market demand and manage increased volumes and volatility. Platforms are architected to support growing volumes, multiple times peak, to ensure scalability, and capacity is automatically increased as new peaks are reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our platforms undergo rigorous and continuous performance and resiliency testing to ensure they can handle peak volumes. At the same time, we continually invest in our infrastructure to ensure we remain able to manage market stresses and effectively deliver services,&rdquo; stated Lynn Bishop, Managing Director and Chief Information Officer, DTCC. &ldquo;All DTCC services continue to perform business as usual, bringing increased confidence and safety to the markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, DTCC's Risk Management capabilities have been instrumental in safeguarding firms, underlying investors and financial markets during stress. These capabilities were further aided by the acceleration of the U.S. settlement cycle to T+1, which took one day of risk out of the market.</p>
<p>NSCC&rsquo;s start of day margin requirements following the elevated market volatility between April 4 and April 11, 2025, averaged $18.3 billion, with NSCC cleared activity reaching new peaks. A similar market price move observed in June 2020 resulted in margin requirements of $18.5 billion. While the margin levels are comparable, the cleared 1-day trading values during the recent market volatility were consistently larger than the cleared 2-day trading values from the 2020 period, highlighting the benefits of the T+1 settlement cycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Risk management is at the foundation of what we do each and every day,&rdquo; stated Tim Cuddihy, Managing Director and Group Chief Risk Officer at DTCC. &ldquo;We continually monitor our risk management framework and margin models to assess risk reduction, performance, and predictability across a wide range of market conditions. All is done with one thing in mind &ndash; the safety of the markets, firms and underlying investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the period of elevated market volatility, FICC promoted safety and soundness to the U.S. Treasury Markets. Key risk metrics and reporting are made available to clients in the new Risk Portal, allowing firms to better monitor and manage risk exposures. With the recent launch of the 15-minute risk monitor, clients now have the same near real-time visibility into margin and risk exposures, on 15-minute increments, as DTCC&rsquo;s risk analysts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DTCC has been battle tested for decades, providing safety and confidence,&rdquo; stated Brian Steele, Managing Director, President, Clearing &amp; Securities Services at DTCC. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll continue to provide this level of performance, while looking toward the future with an innovation mindset that enables us to deliver new value and capabilities that advance the financial ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SET To Implement Auto Pause Mechanism For Strengthened Supervision, Effective May 6, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-to-implement-auto-pause-mechanism-for-strengthened-supervision-effective-ma-2025423/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is strengthening its market supervision with the implementation of <b>the Auto Pause mechanism for individual securities</b> as part of SET&rsquo;s planned regulatory enhancement framework which has been phased in since 2024. This Auto Pause mechanism is primarily intended to provide time for securities firms and investors to evaluate and address irregular order patterns of securities marked with a Pause (P) designation, which indicates their higher-than-usual trading order volumes, thus mitigating irregular matching and reducing potential market risks.</p>
<p>Key details of the Auto Pause mechanism: <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A 60-minute </strong>Auto Pause<strong> </strong>will be automatically activated when an individual security&rsquo;s bid or offer volume across all price levels exceeds 15 percent of its total listed shares. This process features two distinct phases: a 40-minute trading pause, indicated by a Pause (P) symbol, followed by a 20-minute pre-open session before normal order matching resumes. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The activation of the Auto Pause mechanism will be limited to once per day for each individual security, with the scope of application covering common stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), property funds, and infrastructure funds. Other securities, such as warrants, Derivative Warrants (DW), and Single Stock Futures (SSF), having the triggered security as underlying assets will also be paused. The Auto Pause measure is exempted for securities anticipated to experience high trading volumes, such as newly listed securities or those temporarily resuming trading prior to extended suspensions (SP) or delisting.</li>
<li>Order modifications and cancellations will remain permissible during the pause period.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Auto Pause mechanism for individual securities will be effective on May 6, 2025.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit SET's website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.set.or.th/">www.set.or.th</a>&nbsp;under the menu &ldquo;Rules and Regulations&rdquo; section, then &ldquo;Circular Letters - Trading &amp; Supervision.&rdquo;</p>

<title>LME Explores Establishing Price Premia For Sustainable Metals</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-explores-establishing-price-premia-for-sustainable-metals-2025423/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-explores-establishing-price-premia-for-sustainable-metals-2025423/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has started to explore the potential for producing sustainable metal premia for LME-approved brands. It is currently engaging closely with physical market stakeholders on its proposals for four key LME metals. By making a sustainability price differential public, the value attached to sustainable metals will be transparent and could support the development of the market for sustainable metals.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, said: &ldquo;Our conversations with stakeholders have shown that there is support for establishing a way to reflect an LME brand&rsquo;s sustainability in its price. There is a growing sophistication in industry sustainability standards and accreditation programmes that cover broad criteria for different metals markets. Taken together with the disclosure and comparability of these credentials through LMEpassport and our work with Metalshub, these developments provide the opportunity to establish credible sustainability pricing premia for LMElisted metals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are setting out proposals that we believe will support the formation of sustainable premia that will be accessible to the whole market. They will unlock the value attached to sustainability and have the potential to drive the development of the market for more sustainable metals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the greater resilience exhibited by sustainable supply chains provides an important linkage to the global critical minerals agenda.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The proposal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2>
<p>The LME&rsquo;s market engagement on this proposal follows on from the LME&rsquo;s partnership with Metalshub, a digital platform, on an initiative launched in 2024 to develop a price discovery mechanism for low-carbon nickel. The Metalshub platform enables consumers to buy LME-grade low-carbon nickel (using an LME prescribed carbon threshold assessed using the Nickel Institute methodology), and since March last year, Metalshub has reported the monthly volumes transacted through the platform.</p>
<p>The LME is now proposing to launch a broader series of sustainable metal premia for LMEbranded aluminium, copper, nickel and zinc, incorporating a more comprehensive set of criteria* than carbon footprint alone and underpinned by robust assessment processes. Metal brands that meet such criteria would need to submit all their sustainability credentials via LMEpassport. Such metal could then contribute to the price discovery of the sustainability premia via Metalshub&rsquo;s spot offering.</p>
<p>To enable the Metalshub transaction data to be published as a price premium, the LME is proposing to establish a pricing administrator whose role would be to use trading data and apply expert judgement to publish prices. The administrator would set the rules, policies and process for the sustainability premia and market participants would be able to engage with the administrator to raise issues or provide additional data.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Jackel, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Metalshub, added: "Metalshub is proud to support the LME&rsquo;s efforts to bring transparency and price discovery to sustainable metals. By integrating sustainability data into trading processes, we enable participants to make informed decisions, ensuring that responsible metals receive fair market valuation. Providing the technological foundation for price discovery will help to drive the industry towards a greener and more responsible future."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nick Stansbury, Head of Climate Solutions, Asset Management, L&amp;G said: "We welcome the LME's proposal as a much-needed move to enable the proper pricing of low-carbon, sustainable products. We believe transparent pricing of sustainable materials is critical to incentivising investment into transition technologies in the mining industry and we look forward to the outcome of this market engagement process."&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The LME is discussing its proposals with a range of physical market stakeholders, and will provide further progress updates in due course.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><span>In his letter to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, FSB Chair Klaas Knot notes that recent financial market turmoil underscores the importance of robust surveillance, proactive policymaking, and international coordination.</span></em></li>
<li><span>Letter highlights the role played by non-bank entities in periods of recent market turmoil and the need to enhance regulation and monitoring of this critical sector.</span></li>
<li><em><span>Letter emphasises the need for continued reform implementation and international cooperation to ensure a resilient financial system.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/04/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-april-2025/">letter from its Chair, Klaas Knot, to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors</a>&nbsp;ahead of their meeting on 23-24 April.</p>
<p>The letter, Mr Knot&rsquo;s final one as FSB Chair, comes at a time of heightened financial market volatility and geopolitical risks. Reflecting on recent episodes of financial market turmoil, Mr&nbsp;Knot emphasises the importance of vigilance and international cooperation to address emerging risks and ensure the continued resilience of the financial system.</p>
<p>The letter highlights the role played by non-bank financial entities in recent periods of market turmoil, outlining the FSB&rsquo;s work to strengthen the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI). The FSB is finalising recommendations to address financial stability risks arising from leverage in NBFI that will be delivered to the G20 in July, marking a significant step in bolstering the sector&rsquo;s resilience.</p>
<p>The letter also notes the FSB&rsquo;s work to address cyber risks, which have culminated with this month&rsquo;s release of the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/04/format-for-incident-reporting-exchange-fire-final-report/">Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE)</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">;</span>&nbsp;and work to enhance cross-border payments, where efforts are focused on intensifying the FSB&rsquo;s engagement with the private sector and regulators to encourage implementation of the G20 Roadmap. The letter reflects on the FSB&rsquo;s unique role in fostering international cooperation to address financial stability challenges and calls on authorities to remain committed to implementing the agreed international reforms in order to preserve financial stability in an evolving risk environment and avoid fragmentation.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>Eurex, the leading European derivatives exchange and part of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, announces the launch of futures contracts based on bonds issued by the European Union (EU). With the launch of Euro-EU Bond Futures (FBEU), Eurex is expanding its comprehensive product portfolio in European fixed income derivatives. This underlines Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group's commitment to supporting the development of European capital markets as a key strategic pillar of the European agenda. Trading will start on 10 September 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Strengthen liquidity in EU bonds&nbsp;</p>
<p>A physically deliverable futures contract will strengthen the liquidity in EU bond markets and support the position of the EU as a major issuer in the European and global capital markets. Completing the ecosystem across cash, repo, and derivatives markets in line with international fixed income standards will provide market participants with tailor-made risk management and trading opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch follows an extensive dialogue with market participants and the EU Commission. The outstanding amount of EU debt already exceeds EUR 600 billion, making the EU the fifth largest issuer in Europe. Secondary market trading is on par with some of the largest sovereign issuers. To actively support the development of a liquid ecosystem for EU bonds, the EU Commission has already joined Eurex Repo as a trading member in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Eurex Euro-EU Bond Futures contracts will have the same 6% coupon as Eurex&rsquo;s fixed income futures in the same tenor (10-year Bund, OAT, BTP and Bono futures). The deliverable bonds can have maturities ranging from 8 to12 years, reflecting the issuance activity of the EU. The Euro-EU Bond Futures are part of the same portfolio margining group as Eurex&rsquo;s other long and short-term European interest rate derivatives across futures, options, and swaps, providing the market with superior margin and capital efficiencies and strong risk management.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Supporting European ambitions for greater autonomy&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matthias Graulich, Global Head of Products &amp; Markets at Eurex: &ldquo;The launch of the Euro-EU Bond Futures is more than just a new product for Eurex. It is a strategic commitment to supporting European ambitions for greater autonomy at a time when the continent is relying on additional debt issuance and investors are seeking tailored tools to manage their exposure to EU debt. This step complements and re-affirms Eurex&rsquo;s Home of the Euro Yield Curve strategy.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The report provides critical insights into market growth, consumer behaviour, technological challenges, and the path towards a future of borderless payments.</span></p>
<p><span>Thunes' 2025 Mobile Wallet report highlights one of the most dramatic shifts in the payments market: mobile wallets are quickly establishing themselves as the new standard. In Southeast Asia and Africa, the rapid adoption of mobile payments is enabling these regions to leapfrog traditional payment methods, moving directly from cash reliance to a fully digital ecosystem. Even in markets historically dominated by card transactions, mobile wallet adoption is rising sharply, signaling a global trend towards more agile, digital-first payment solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>The key findings of the report revolve around 5 key pillars:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Explosive Growth:&nbsp;</b>Mobile wallet users are projected to rise from 4.3 billion in 2024 to 5.8 billion by 2029, while digital transaction values are expected to jump from $10 trillion to $17 trillion, a 73% increase, according to&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLinm-2B1lNsWkXbcDTQWMOJUj6VUV9FC5D7QwdowfY06ZztEMBW_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJCEe3ZhZI9LY37ToPijC0T099chDa6l6T6BdFTk6tBCeME6nIUCBecr1iUUd2-2BLWbioT4EVusiAMGw4UOdTVGQSY6oDAOqu44XX-2FswaPywKmqlioA-2FfMwfzEPt0wxuq6LNbO-2FEl1VO1vOENMQanguM4xn9TZlA8Q7naDqvktRVA9imqsknzYnnl9hyvNIXyVp7RCWGjJgOGZJS7-2B93Be0Aq1WpgXsA-2Bi2VERYxcipe32EWmOyjGD7Mzhm7NXpEx9r3h2kN3J5J5HeahdDmbVNU3XIUujFY3CxxWxsglPXv5A-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Data</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><b>Digital-First Consumer Behaviour:</b>&nbsp;Mobile wallets have evolved from basic contactless payments during COVID-19 into integral, multifunctional tools. They now support everything from everyday bill payments to the gig economy, meeting the seamless demands of digitally native generations.<br /><br /></li>
<li><b>Interoperability Imperative:&nbsp;</b>The current mobile wallet landscape is fragmented, operating in silos that hinder integration with legacy banking systems and card networks. Bridging these gaps is essential to unlocking global market potential and ensuring smooth cross-border transactions.<br /><br /></li>
<li><b>Strengthening Regional Markets:</b>&nbsp;The refined regional analysis presented in the report highlights dynamic market developments across Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America, North America, and Europe. The report details how strategic global players connect banks, fintechs, and mobile wallet providers, driving a trend toward market consolidation, making digital payments more reliable and expansive. This renewed focus is critical in addressing regulatory differences and diverse local payment cultures.<br /><br /></li>
<li><b>A Catalyst for Economic Transformation:&nbsp;</b>Facilitating seamless cross-border transactions with the inclusion of mobile wallets payment systems enhances consumer trust and propels economic growth in emerging markets and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Mathieu Limousi,</b><span>&nbsp;Chief Marketing Officer at Thunes said: "The findings in Thunes' 2025 Mobile Wallet report reflect a profound transformation in the global payments landscape. With mobile wallet users expected to reach 5.8 billion by 2029 and digital wallet transaction values projected to grow 73% in just five years, the shift to digital payments is accelerating and becoming the new global standard. Yet, the lack of interoperability remains the biggest barrier to truly inclusive and efficient cross-border commerce. These insights will be invaluable to the Members of Thunes' Direct Global Network, and to the entire cross-border payments ecosystem as we work to build a more connected and accessible financial future."</span></p>

<title>“Charting A Steady Course In A Changing World” – Opening Address By Mr Chia Der Jiun, Managing Director, Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The IMAS Annual Investment Conference 2025 On 23 April 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/charting-a-steady-course-in-a-changing-world-opening-address-by-mr-chia-der-2025423/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IMAS EXCO<br />Ms Carmen Wee, IMAS CEO<br />Ladies and Gentlemen<br /><br />1. Good morning. I am delighted to join you today at the 28th IMAS Annual Investment Conference.<br /><br />2. This year&rsquo;s conference theme &ndash; &ldquo;Navigating an Evolving Landscape&rdquo; &ndash; is apt but may be understating the environment we are in today. Fundamental shifts in trade policy and the geo-strategic landscape have led us into a period of heightened uncertainty in the global economy and volatility in financial markets. In this new landscape of uncertainty and volatility, the asset management industry plays an important role in sustaining investor confidence and contributing to the resilience of markets.<br /><br /><span>Role of Asset Management Industry to Manage Uncertainty</span><br /><br />3. Let me focus on 3 areas that the asset management industry can help in:</p>
<p>a. One, build more resilient markets;<br />b. Two, provide products and portfolios that meet investors&rsquo; diversification and retirement needs; and<br />c. Three, support better informed investors.</p>
<p><span>Resilient Markets</span></p>
<p>4. There are several components that contribute towards more resilient markets. Transparency, market integrity and settlement efficiency are fundamental. Regulators have a role in putting these right. Market infrastructure operators also have a role. Trading venues should be liquidity enhancing rather than liquidity fragmenting. Margin requirements should be set at levels that avoid amplifying funding stresses.<br /><br />5. Market participants too play a role. Leverage needs to be deployed carefully to mitigate procyclical deleveraging. To be clear, market functionality has generally remained resilient through stress episodes, including through the sharp market repricing of risks and uncertainty in April. But we are also all aware of episodes where volatility spiked and market functionality deteriorated. In August last year, Japanese equities fell sharply and VIX spiked following the unwinding of leveraged carry trades. Earlier this month, 10-year Treasuries rose 50bps over a short period of time, while the dollar weakened. A commonly heard attribution has been the unwind of leveraged trades. Crowded leveraged trades are vulnerable to changing policy, economic and market conditions. Market resilience is better assured through a diversity of market participants, employing a myriad of strategies which provides depth and two-way flows. Let me give the example of Singapore&rsquo;s FX market, where MAS had sought to foster a diverse ecosystem of market participants to support depth and stability.</p>
<p>a. In FX markets, we made efforts since 2018 via our Foreign Exchange E-Trading (&ldquo;FXET&rdquo;) initiative, to strengthen infrastructure capabilities. This has improved pricing and trade-fill efficiency while reducing latency. Over time, a diverse group of FX players have anchored their matching and pricing engines in Singapore to serve regional market participants. This enhancement of FX capabilities and infrastructure has supported FX price discovery and market functionality in this region during both Business-as-Usual and under stressed periods. Our eFX ecosystem continues to grow well with a diversity of market participants including platforms, banks, real money, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. This has contributed to Singapore&rsquo;s continued growth as a leading FX hub in Asia, with the average daily traded volumes crossing US$ 1 trillion in 2024.<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/charting-a-steady-course-in-a-changing-world#1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>6. At this time of heightened uncertainty, MAS is closely watching that Singapore&rsquo;s foreign exchange and S$ money markets continue to function in an orderly manner. We also monitor the functionality of key funding markets in coordination with central banks globally.<br /><br /><span>Products and Portfolios that Meet Diversification and Retirement Needs</span></p>
<p>7. Let me turn to my second point. Asset managers are key to providing fund products that serve the savings and retirement needs for our region. Their products should contribute to portfolio diversification and help investors manage market volatility while investing for the long term. In building and delivering such products,:</p>
<p>a. Asset managers must have in place an effective liquidity and market risk management framework. There is a need to run regular stress testing on your portfolio risks under conditions when volatility spikes and correlations break down. Funds should also stress your ability to handle redemption spikes amidst adverse market movements. Global regulatory bodies such as the FSB and IOSCO have made calls for further enhancements to strengthen the industry&rsquo;s resilience in both normal and stressed market conditions, by reinforcing consistency between the funds&rsquo; investment strategy and liquidity of fund assets, with redemption terms. In line with this, MAS will study the need to review the current framework for liquidity risk management by asset managers, and will engage the industry when ready.<br />b. Product distributors and providers should also ensure that marketing and advertisements are fair and balanced. Marketing should not over-emphasise product features that are not sustainable across a robust range of scenarios. A sudden withdrawal of such product features could cause a loss of confidence and a redemption spike.<br />c. Clear and timely disclosures should be provided to investors, to enable them to make well-informed investment decisions in fast-changing market conditions.</p>
<p>8. To provide retail investors with a wider set of investment choices, MAS is also currently consulting on a framework for private market investment funds for retail investors.</p>
<p>a. Private market investments, such as private equity and infrastructure, generally have longer investment horizons and a differentiated set of risk factors that are different than public market investments. Retail investors may be interested in gaining exposure to this asset class as part of a well-diversified investment portfolio.<br />b. We welcome feedback from all IMAS members as we work towards developing a balanced and risk-calibrated framework that can support the growth of a robust and sustainable market for such retail funds.</p>
<p><span>Support Better Informed Investors</span></p>
<p>9. Third, asset managers support better informed investors, through continued partnership with MAS and the MoneySense community on investor education.<br /><br />10. When MAS launched the national financial education programme MoneySense in 2003, one of its goals was to support consumers in becoming more self-reliant in financial affairs. This was important as consumers needed to exercise their judgement, evaluate the suitability of investments for their own needs, even as more complex and varied products entered the financial markets.<br /><br />11. Over the years, industry associations, including IMAS, community organisations and consumer bodies have been valuable partners. Together, MoneySense&rsquo;s activities and programmes were launched to enhance consumers&rsquo; understanding of financial affairs, whether it is in managing money, insurance protection, or investing and planning for retirement.<br /><br /><span>IMAS&rsquo; Contributions to Industry</span><br /><br />12. Let me say a few words of appreciation for IMAS&rsquo; role in galvanizing the industry.<br /><br />13. I am happy to see IMAS&rsquo; continued efforts to bring partners together to uplift the asset management sector. As I mentioned earlier, IMAS has played an important role in improving public education through your ongoing partnerships with MoneySense, SGX and FundSingapore. IMAS has also contributed efforts towards reskilling and upskilling for industry professionals by developing the iLEARN platform since 2019 as a one-stop platform for relevant training programmes in line with market shifts.<br /><br />14. I am also encouraged to know that IMAS has taken the lead to support its members to deepen expertise in sustainable finance.&nbsp;<span>I am happy today to be part of a significant milestone - the launch of the IMAS Climate Handbook in partnership with Amundi.</span>&nbsp;This practical guide will enable asset managers to integrate climate considerations into risk assessments as well as investment frameworks.<br /><br />15. In closing, as regulator and developer of the asset management industry, we share a common goal with market participants to keep our markets stable and vibrant and to ensure its sustainable growth in the face of global headwinds. MAS will continue to partner with IMAS and its members to build a more resilient, competitive, and innovative asset management ecosystem.<br /><br />16. Thank you and wishing you all a fulfilling Conference ahead.</p>

<title>Transmission of Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At the Heller-Hurwicz Economics Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Juan Pablo. I am delighted to be speaking at the University of Minnesota because, in many ways, this visit feels like a homecoming for me.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I was born right here in Minneapolis, before I moved to Colombia as a young child. My parents told me so many wonderful stories about this area and the university. My father studied for his Ph.D. here at the economics department. He studied under accomplished economists, including Anne Krueger, Leo Hurwicz, John Buttrick, and Ed Foster, the latter of whom is still here as an emeritus professor. The University of Minnesota has made many contributions to the field of economics and has historically had a close relationship with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. So you really are part of the Fed's extended family, and it is an honor to speak with you.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak with you about the transmission of the Fed's monetary policy. I will discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy, then touch on how I monitor its transmission, and, lastly, talk about two elements related to transmission that I evaluate when making monetary policy decisions. Those elements are the long and variable lags of monetary policy and whether its transmission is asymmetric and has changed over time. But before I delve into my primary topic, I would like to start by offering my views on the economic outlook.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />The U.S. economy has grown at a solid pace, with real gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 2.5 percent last year. Activity indicators in the first few months of this year show healthy numbers. Last week, the March retail sales release showed resilient consumption, with positive revisions for January and February numbers. However, measures of household sentiment, such as surveys from the University of Michigan, Conference Board, and Morning Consult, have shown signs of softness, albeit to varying degrees. Many survey respondents report that their views reflect trade policy concerns, though, as we have seen, the exact contours of those policies are still taking shape. Thus, GDP growth for the first quarter, which will be reported next week, may show some moderation relative to what we saw in 2024, although this moderation may be offset by increased purchases front-loading the implementation of tariffs. Financial markets have experienced increased volatility in recent weeks. If financial conditions were to tighten persistently, that could weigh on growth in the future.</p>
<p>The labor market remains solid, but the pace of hiring has eased during this year. In the first quarter, U.S. employers added 152,000 jobs per month, on average, compared with a monthly pace of 168,000, on average, last year. The unemployment rate edged up last month to 4.2 percent, but it is still low and has remained near its current level since last summer. Moreover, initial jobless claims have remained stable at low levels. Those numbers are consistent with other measures indicating that the labor market is broadly in balance.</p>
<p>With respect to inflation, progress has slowed since last summer, and inflation remains above the 2 percent goal. Based on the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) data, the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was estimated to have been 2.3 percent last month and 2.6 percent for the core categories, which exclude food and energy.</p>
<p>I pay careful attention to two subcategories of inflation: first, core goods&mdash;which are goods outside of volatile food and energy products&mdash;and, second, nonhousing market-based services, which are based on transactions and not imputed prices, such as car maintenance and haircuts. Goods inflation was negative in most of 2024&mdash;as was the norm for several years before the pandemic&mdash;but it increased to 0.4 percent in January and February. In March, the CPI and PPI releases pointed to goods inflation decreasing to a still-positive 0.1 percent, which is better news. By contrast, nonhousing market services inflation stayed elevated through March, at an estimated 3.4 percent. That category often provides a good signal of inflationary pressures across all services. As we look ahead, while the long-run level of tariffs is still to be determined, tariffs have moved significantly higher this year. That will likely put upward pressure on prices. For instance, both survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation expectations have moved up. Longer-term inflation expectations&mdash;those beyond the next few years&mdash;largely remain well anchored and consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, and I hope they continue in that way.</p>
<p>I am closely monitoring incoming data and the cumulative effects on both sides of our mandate from policies in four distinct areas: trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation. I am also monitoring any risks to the outlook, especially upside risks on inflation or downside risks to employment. Still, I think our monetary policy is well positioned for changes in the macroeconomic environment. Thus, I will support maintaining the current policy rate for as long as these upside risks to inflation continue, while economic activity and employment remain stable. I remain committed to achieving both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p><span>Overview of Monetary Policy Transmission</span><br />Now turning to the primary topic of my speech, I will first discuss how monetary policy is transmitted through the economy. In this section, I will give some examples from the recent past as a tool for explaining my arguments, but I am not intending to comment further on the latest developments in the economy.</p>
<p>Understanding the transmission of monetary policy starts with understanding how the Federal Reserve uses its policy tools. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adjusts the target range for the federal funds rate, or the rate that banks pay for overnight borrowing. Setting the federal funds rate is the primary means by which the Fed adjusts the stance of monetary policy, among its range of monetary policy tools. In addition to the FOMC directly adjusting the federal funds rate, Fed policymakers' communications about the future path of monetary policy may also result in changes to longer-term interest rates because households' and businesses' expectations about future policy affect the level of interest rates.</p>
<p>Adjustments to the federal funds rate affect a multitude of financial conditions faced by consumers and businesses. For example, changes to the federal funds rate filter through to the interest rates lenders charge for loans to businesses and households as well as to what financial institutions pay in interest on deposits. The current and expected future path of the federal funds rate also affects asset prices, as it changes the relative attractiveness of different investments, such as stocks and real estate. Fluctuations in both interest rates and asset prices affect a household's wealth and a corporation's balance sheet, which can, in turn, affect the terms under which they can borrow.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I have discussed some of the most common ways in which policy is transmitted. There are, of course, other important channels, such as exchange rates and international spillovers, that I will not discuss today. Research suggests that the channels of transmission are extensive and ever evolving.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Consumers and businesses make decisions based on financial conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;For illustrative purposes, let's consider a period when FOMC policymakers view it as appropriate to ease the restrictiveness of monetary policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate over time. The resulting lower interest rates on consumer loans elicit greater spending on goods and services, particularly on durable goods that are often financed. Lower mortgage rates can encourage renters to buy a home by reducing the monthly payment borrowers face and can encourage existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages to free up cash for other purchases. Lower interest rates can make holding equities more attractive, which raises stock prices and adds to wealth. Higher wealth tends to spur more spending, as households tend to consume at least a portion of their increased wealth. Investment projects that businesses previously believed would be marginally unprofitable become attractive because of reduced financing costs, particularly if businesses expect their sales to rise. Expecting a better macroeconomic environment and lower delinquency rates down the road, banks may loosen their lending standards on approving loans for households and businesses. All these decisions support aggregate demand and may put upward pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>Of course, there are periods when policymakers see it as appropriate to increase the level of restraint placed on the economy by raising the federal funds rate over time. That may occur when policymakers are seeking to lower inflation. Then, the monetary policy effects I just described would be reversed, putting downward pressure on aggregate demand and inflation.</p>
<p><span>Developments in Monetary Policy and Financial Conditions</span><br />Let me now discuss how I view the transmission and the stance of monetary policy during the past few quarters. To be clear, I will not discuss the developments in financial markets over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>In the second half of last year, I gained greater confidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I also wanted to preserve the strength I saw in the labor market. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decision to decrease the target range for the federal funds rate by a total of 1 percentage point during the meetings from September through December. However, even before the Committee began to ease policy, some financial conditions started to ease. This easing can be seen in the Financial Conditions Impulse on Growth index.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;That index, developed by Federal Reserve Board staff, showed easier financial conditions from March 2024. And through January, the demand for loans by households and businesses picked up.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;In the early months of the year, financial conditions, however, remained somewhat restrictive, as borrowing costs continued to be elevated and bank credit moderately tight. Through March, interest rates on short-term small business loans had only edged down since their post-pandemic peak.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Banks stopped tightening lending standards after nine consecutive quarters, but they left standards unchanged in January.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;These financial conditions helped to moderate aggregate demand and aid in moving inflation sustainably toward our 2 percent target.</p>
<p><span>Details of Monetary Policy Transmission</span><br />Monitoring the financial conditions I just described is one important way I evaluate how well the Fed's monetary policy is being transmitted to the rest of the economy. But it is not the only way. I also consider two other elements that play important roles in the transmission of our monetary policy.</p>
<p><em>Timing Matters</em><br />The first element to evaluate is the timing with which monetary policy affects the macroeconomy. The contemporary economics literature uses a variety of statistical models to estimate the effects of what are called monetary policy "shocks." Those are movements in the policy rate that are not explained by estimates of how monetary policy systematically responds to incoming economic and financial data and are not anticipated by the public.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Focusing on the estimated effects of these shocks helps isolate the consequences solely coming from monetary policy actions and communications. One lesson that emerges from this research is that, broadly speaking, it turns out that Milton Friedman's "long and variable lags" concept still holds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;A selection of key studies on the topic estimates that it takes about one to two years for the maximum effects of policy to be observed in economic activity and inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;These long lags in monetary policy affecting the economy point to why it is important for policymakers to anticipate economic conditions as best as possible and try to be proactive about understanding the effects of different shocks to the economy, so they can act quickly when needed.</p>
<p><em>Direction of Travel</em><br />The second element to consider when making decisions related to monetary policy is whether its transmission has been equally impactful during different points in time. For example, credible evidence indicates that contractionary monetary shocks may generally decrease economic activity more strongly than expansionary shocks increase it.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;To understand these asymmetric effects, consider the following illustrative metaphor used by Marriner Eccles, who led the Fed back in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Imagine a string with monetary policy at one end and the economy at the other. Employing tight monetary policy when inflation is rising is like pulling on the string to keep the economy in check&mdash;it works fairly well. But attempting to stimulate the economy with loose policy during a downturn is like trying to push on the string to move the economy&mdash;a more difficult task.</p>
<p>There is evidence of this asymmetry in consumer spending on long-lasting durable goods, such as vehicles and appliances. While an easier monetary policy may lower interest rates and thus stimulate spending on durable goods in the near term, the effects of that policy may be smaller over time, as households may have already purchased durable goods.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;If a family replaces their living room furniture when rates are low, they are unlikely to need a new set of furniture a few years later and thus would not consider how current rates would change their decisions. Thus, during an easing cycle, it is reasonable to suspect that the potency of monetary policy may be somewhat diminished.</p>
<p>Another example of asymmetry can be seen in the transmission of monetary policy to private lending. Board staff research documented strong growth in the period between the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic, fueled by structural factors, such as the attractiveness of the market to borrowers and investors due to its higher customization.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;One implication of this strong growth during this past policy tightening is that monetary policy transmission to private credit markets appeared more muted relative to financing through public credit markets or bank commercial and industrial lending.</p>
<p>By contrast, other factors specific to the recent period likely decreased the potency of monetary policy during the tightening cycle but may increase it during the easing cycle. When the pandemic struck and social distancing was common, many households severely curtailed spending. In addition, a historic level of government transfers boosted household income. This combination led the personal savings rate to soar.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Recent work by Board staff suggests that these excess savings accumulated during the pandemic may have reduced the effects of tighter monetary policy over recent years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;If households are flush with excess cash, they are less likely to respond to elevated interest rates by curtailing demand. Instead, they may have funds to avoid financing or may feel they are able to afford higher monthly payments.</p>
<p>Now, some five years after the pandemic began, these excess savings are exhausted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250422a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;This creates an environment in which monetary policy could be having its average effects on the household sector, although we should consider that the financial health of borrowers with lower credit scores has deteriorated meaningfully in recent years and credit card and auto loan delinquencies are now above pre-pandemic levels. For these households, easing monetary policy may have larger effects.</p>
<p>I am closely monitoring all these possible changes in monetary policy transmission across the economy. Also, I am humbly aware that it is difficult for economists to judge the overall effect of monetary policy actions on the U.S. economy in real time.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />To summarize, I see inflation still running above the 2 percent target while the labor market has remained stable. But the economy is facing heightened uncertainty, with upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment. This month, we learned that the tariff increases are significantly larger than previously expected. As a result, the economic effects of tariffs and the associated uncertainty are also likely to be larger than anticipated. It is important for monetary policymakers to broadly examine all available information, including market-based measures, surveys, and anecdotal reports, to understand what is happening in the economy as early as possible because, as I discussed, it takes time for policy to have an impact. As the direction of the economy changes, it is critical to pay close attention to real-time data and to consider the lags and asymmetries of policy transmission to ensure we respond not only to the actual movements on both sides of the mandate, but also to the risks to the economic outlook.</p>
<p>As I observe the economy and consider the appropriate path of monetary policy, I am closely studying how the decisions the FOMC makes are transmitted through the economy. We have learned much about how those transmission channels work and how they may have changed in recent years, and there is much more to learn. I am confident some of that research will be done right here at the University of Minnesota. Overall, of course, when setting policy, I am guided by how best to achieve the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices given to us by Congress because that results in the best outcomes for all Americans.</p>
<p>Thank you again for such a warm welcome back to the Twin Cities.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ramil Palafox for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme that raised approximately $198 million from investors worldwide and for misappropriating more than $57 million of investor funds.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Palafox&rsquo;s company, known as PGI Global, claimed to be a crypto asset and foreign exchange trading company. From January 2020 through October 2021, Palafox offered and sold PGI Global &ldquo;membership&rdquo; packages, which he claimed guaranteed investors high returns from PGI Global&rsquo;s supposed crypto asset and foreign exchange trading and offered members multi-level-marketing-like referral incentives to encourage them to recruit new investors. However, as the complaint alleges, Palafox misappropriated more than $57 million in investor funds to buy Lamborghinis, items from luxury retailers, and for other personal expenses. He also used the majority of the remaining investor funds to pay other investors their purported returns and referral rewards in a Ponzi-like scheme until its collapse in late 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in our complaint, Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds,&rdquo; said Scott Thompson, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;We will continue to investigate and take action against bad actors who take advantage of investors with promises of guaranteed passive income and other lies and deceit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palafox used the guise of innovation to lure investors into lining his pockets with millions of dollars while leaving many victims empty-handed,&rdquo; said Laura D&rsquo;Allaird, Chief of the Commission&rsquo;s new Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit. &ldquo;In reality, his false claims of crypto industry expertise and a supposed AI-powered auto-trading platform were just masking an international securities fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, charges Palafox with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, conduct-based injunctions preventing Palafox from participating in multi-level-marketing programs involving the offer or sale of securities and offerings of crypto assets bought or sold as a security, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names BBMR Threshold LLC, Darvie Mendoza, Marissa Mendoza Palafox, and Linda Ventura as relief defendants and seeks disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains and prejudgment interest.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, Palafox was arraigned in U.S. District Court on criminal charges brought by the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Michael Cuff and Polly Hayes of the Philadelphia Regional Office and Assunta Vivolo of the SEC&rsquo;s Market Abuse Unit. It is being supervised by Ms. D&rsquo;Allaird and Mr. Thompson. The litigation will be conducted by Spencer Willig and Gregory Bockin of the Philadelphia Regional Office and Eugene Hansen of SEC Headquarters. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office, the FBI, and the IRS.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy directs investors to resources on detecting and avoiding pyramid schemes posing as multi-level marketing programs.

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Research Uncovers Concerns About Finfluencers’ Power Of Persuasion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission&rsquo;s (OSC) latest research report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-research-and-reports/social-media-and-retail-investing-rise-finfluencers"><em>Social Media and Retail Investing: The Rise of Finfluencers</em></a>, found social media finfluencers have considerable influence on retail investors&rsquo; decision making.</p>
<p>Financial influencers (&ldquo;finfluencers&rdquo;) use their social media platforms to share finance and investing insights. Some finfluencer messaging includes sharing posts about their recent successful stock picks, making claims about their own financial successes and emphasizing the limited availability of an investment opportunity.</p>
<p>An OSC survey of 655 Canadian retail investors found that about 35% of respondents reported making a financial decision based on advice from a finfluencer. Financial advice on social media is appealing because retail investors perceive it to be accessible, free, and informative.</p>
<p>While retail investors believe finfluencers are generally motivated by self-interest, about 40% of investors believe that the finfluencers they follow are trustworthy. Those who have made a financial decision based on finfluencer advice were seven times more likely to trust finfluencers they follow.</p>
<p>Relatedly, those who have made a financial decision based on finfluencer advice were also 12 times more likely to have been scammed on social media. The results suggest that those who trust and follow the advice of finfluencers may be more vulnerable to social media scams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finfluencers have a clear capacity to affect their audience&rsquo;s behaviour, and this influence could diminish retail investor well-being &ndash; especially if the advice is poor quality,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;Our findings reaffirm the importance of understanding how finfluencer content affects retail investor behaviours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also details an online experiment with 1,465 Canadian social media users (both investors and non-investors), which assessed the impact of finfluencers and strategies to combat misinformation. Participants were exposed to social media posts promoting a particular asset during an online trading simulation. The posts resembled the type of content found on Reddit, X and YouTube.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% of participants exposed to finance-related social media posts purchased the promoted assets, compared to about 10% of those not exposed. Non-investors were more likely to be influenced by social media posts compared to those already in the market.</p>
<p>Several interventions used to reduce the persuasiveness of social media content were effective &mdash; however, they did not eliminate the impact of social media messaging entirely.</p>
<p>The OSC collaborated with The Decision Lab to explore the relationship between Canadian retail investors and non-investors and the financial information they encounter on social media.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear SEC Colleagues,</p>
<p>Sometimes, life comes full circle. In October 2006, I joined the Commission as counsel to then-Commissioner Paul S. Atkins. One of his other counsels was Hester Peirce. Today, I take great pride in seeing Paul sworn in as the next Chairman of the Commission.</p>
<p>Now, the transition set in motion by the voters last November is complete. It has been an honor to serve as your Acting Chairman since President Trump signed my designation three months ago.</p>
<p>At the outset, I asked for your patience as we worked to respond and implement the new directions and executive orders from President Trump. I am grateful that you gave it to me.</p>
<p>During the last three months, you have worked hard to advance our mission. At the same time, we bid farewell to many colleagues who opted to retire or otherwise leave the Commission.</p>
<p>We have accomplished many things since January. We established the Crypto Task Force and withdrew enforcement actions in registration-only crypto cases. We replaced SAB 121 and held public roundtables on what regulation of crypto should look like. We provided guidance, including updates to Schedule 13G eligibility, changed FAQs for the Advisers Act marketing rule, and issued Staff Legal Bulletin 14M on shareholder proposals. We removed personally identifiable information from the Consolidated Audit Trail.</p>
<p>We dropped our defense of the climate rule and withdrew the appeal of the dealer rule. We extended certain compliance dates where needed to avoid market disruption, such as the clearing of U.S. Treasury securities. We successfully oversaw the markets during periods of record-breaking trading activity. We resumed having in-person Commission meetings and managed the return to office.</p>
<p>None of these accomplishments could have been done without your efforts. I also want to recognize the contributions of the Division and Office leaders as well as my personal staff in the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s office. Thank you.</p>
<p>I look forward to returning to my regular role as a Commissioner and working on behalf of investors, issuers, and market participants. See you around!</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. Singleton, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak here today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is great to be back in Philadelphia, and I look forward to today's discussions on economic mobility.</p>
<p>As monetary policymakers, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee do not have direct control over economic mobility in the U.S. Our key monetary policy tools are not designed to address this issue, nor is economic mobility part of our mandate. However, our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability has implications for a wide range of economic outcomes, including economic mobility. This leads to many important questions about the relationship between the dual mandate and economic mobility. In my remarks, I want to address two such questions. First, does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? And second, does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy?</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-slide2.png" id="fig1">today's talk</a>, I will discuss my views on these questions, but I will not be able to provide definitive answers. Rather, I hope that posing these questions and relaying some of my own thoughts will lead to further discussions during this conference and beyond. Before turning to these questions, let me start with a brief overview of intergenerational mobility in the U.S.</p>
<p><span>Taking Stock of Economic Mobility</span><br />Economic mobility, the ability to move up the economic ladder, is at the heart of the American dream. We tell our children that in the U.S., if you work hard and play by the rules, you can have a secure and successful financial future no matter where you start. We continue to believe strongly in this part of the American dream and remain optimistic that hard work is a primary determinant of later-life success. In a survey from 2019, when respondents were asked which factors are essential or very important to getting ahead in life, nearly 90 percent identified hard work, and only 30 percent indicated coming from a wealthy family.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Policymakers have long been aware of the importance of economic mobility. To illustrate that, let me share a quote from former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke: "Equality of economic opportunity appeals to our sense of fairness, certainly, but it also strengthens our economy. If each person is free to develop and apply his or her talents to the greatest extent possible, then both the individual and the economy benefit."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>With these sentiments of what Americans and policymakers think and feel about mobility in mind, let me turn to some evidence on economic mobility in the U.S. One common way to measure economic mobility is to relate an individual's income in adulthood to their family income during childhood. The measure I am showing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure1.png" id="fig">here</a>&mdash;from Harvard economist Raj Chetty and coauthors&mdash;is likely familiar to many of you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It shows a relative intergenerational mobility measure, also known as the "rank&ndash;rank" relationship. This measure relates a child's ranking in the income distribution as an adult, shown on the vertical axis, to the child's family income rank during childhood, shown on the horizontal axis.</p>
<p>The upward slope of the line implies that children born into lower-income families tend to be lower on the income distribution as adults. For example, a child born to the richest parents is, on average, 30 percentage points higher in the income distribution as an adult compared with a child born to the poorest parents. This difference in the relative standing in the income distribution as an adult translates into meaningful differences in earnings levels. To put this in perspective, consider two children who grow up to be 30 percentile points apart on the earnings distribution as adults, with one at the 80th percentile and the other at the 50th percentile. The child who grows up to be at the 80th percentile of the distribution as an adult will earn roughly twice as much compared with the child at the 50th percentile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>In addition to having lower earnings as adults, children born into lower-income families are more likely to experience outcomes that can negatively affect their success in the labor market later in life. Girls born into the bottom decile of the family income distribution are about 10 times more likely to become teenage mothers compared with those born to top-decile families.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Boys born into bottom-decile families are roughly 20 times more likely to be incarcerated in their thirties compared with boys from families in the top decile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Teen pregnancy and incarceration are extreme examples of barriers to labor market success that differentially affect children from lower-income families. More generally, there are numerous reasons that any individual may struggle in the labor market, including skill mismatches and lack of proper training or education.</p>
<p><span>Does Meeting the Dual Mandate Facilitate Economic Mobility?</span><br />Now, let me turn to the Fed's dual mandate and discuss how working toward maximum employment and price stability helps set the stage for broad-based success generally, and how this may provide favorable conditions for upward mobility.</p>
<p>Consider my first question: Does meeting the dual mandate facilitate economic mobility? To help answer this question, I want to revisit remarks I delivered earlier this year about the implications of noninflationary expansions on shared prosperity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Specifically, I am reflecting on the economic expansion that followed the 2007&ndash;09 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). During that period, the economy expanded for 128 consecutive months, making it the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.</p>
<p>As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure2.png" id="fig">figure 2</a>, the aggregate unemployment rate fell steadily from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 3.5 percent in September 2019, the lowest level recorded in nearly 50 years. The labor market in this period was remarkable in terms of broad-based gains seen across demographic groups, which contributed to a historic narrowing of employment differentials. To illustrate this point, let's add in unemployment rates by levels of education, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure3.png" id="fig">figure 3</a>. In 2019, the unemployment rate gaps between workers with less than a high school education, the solid green line near the top of the chart, and those who had attained at least a bachelor's degree, the solid orange line closer to the bottom, were near multidecade lows. Further, the strong pre-pandemic labor market drew many new participants into the labor force, including teens and younger workers whose employment prospects, and even long-term career trajectories, are especially sensitive to the cyclical state of the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These are the types of labor market conditions that the economist Arthur Okun speculated would increase upward mobility.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In a tight labor market, when individuals move up the job ladder, they create openings for newer or less educated workers.</p>
<p>Moving on to earnings,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure4.png" id="fig">figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows that nominal wage growth increased steadily following the GFC. As with gains in employment, the strong labor market was especially beneficial for some groups. To demonstrate that, let's turn to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure5.png" id="fig">figure 5</a>, which shows wage growth for different earnings levels. Wage growth for the bottom half of earners, the dashed red line, started to pick up about five years into the expansion, and by 2017, it was notably stronger compared with that for workers in the top half of the earnings distribution, the solid blue line.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;These differences in wage growth are important. As the bottom of the distribution catches up to higher earners, wage inequality declines. These are also dynamics that can facilitate upward economic mobility.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the second component of the dual mandate, price stability. While some long economic expansions have led to an unwelcome rise in prices, inflation remained low and stable during the economic expansion following the GFC. Indeed, Federal Reserve policymakers were grappling with inflation somewhat below, rather than above, the longer-run 2 percent target, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure6.png" id="fig">figure 6</a>.</p>
<p>Low and stable inflation is important for individuals and businesses for a variety of reasons. It ensures that the nominal wage gains I just discussed are not eroded in real terms and that necessities remain affordable. In addition, it helps individuals and families plan for major purchases, such as a car or home, and for major expenses, including retirement and college.</p>
<p>I want to highlight one of these major expenses&mdash;higher education&mdash;as attending college is an important pathway for upward mobility. Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure7.png" id="fig">figure 7</a>, higher education inflation is shown by the red line. A variety of factors affect the cost of college generally, including student loan costs, state funding, and administrative overhead. Nonetheless, when inflation was low for an extended period during the economic expansion that followed the GFC, we also saw a moderation in the growth of higher education costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of college attendance for mobility, let me&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20250422-figure8.png" id="fig">return</a>&nbsp;to the rank&ndash;rank intergenerational mobility relationship I showed earlier. As before, the darkest dots show the national child-income-rank-to-parent-income-rank relationship. Now consider how this relationship looks across different types of higher education. The red line shows elite four-year colleges, the green line shows the remaining four-year institutions, and the lighter-blue line shows two-year schools. As you can see from the colored lines, the relationship between family income rank and later-life income rank is weaker&mdash;that is, the slope of the line is flatter&mdash;within each type of college than it is nationally.</p>
<p>The flatter slope indicates that outcomes for children from lower-income families are more similar to outcomes for children from higher-income families within each college type than they are overall. In this way, higher education is an important source of upward mobility for many youths and a pathway to a more secure financial future. Of course, the relatively steeper national relationship holds because there are meaningful differences in college enrollment over the family income distribution.</p>
<p>Going back to my initial question, I asked whether meeting the dual mandate facilitates economic mobility. I think that achieving the dual mandate sets the conditions for all individuals to succeed, including those moving up the economic ladder. The evidence suggests that long noninflationary expansions are associated with narrower gaps in employment and earnings, and that lower-wage and less-educated workers benefit disproportionately from sustained periods of strong economic growth. Further, achieving price stability allows individuals and households to plan for and make investments in human capital, such as attending college, that may allow individuals to move up the income distribution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20250422a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p><span>Does Economic Mobility Matter for the Conduct of Monetary Policy?</span><br />Before I conclude, I want to return to my second question: Does economic mobility matter for the conduct of monetary policy? As I mentioned earlier, economic mobility is not part of the Federal Reserve's mandate, and our monetary policy tools are blunt instruments for affecting economic mobility. For example, interest rates affect the entire economy, not targeted populations, and rate changes operate through financial markets rather than directly influencing labor market outcomes.</p>
<p>One way that economic mobility could matter for the conduct of monetary policy is if the goals of monetary policy are easier to achieve in a high-mobility society compared with one with low mobility. I do not know if this is true, but let me offer some conjectures. I think that a society with relatively higher mobility may allow for more efficient transmission of monetary policy. In a dynamic economy with relatively more upward mobility, individuals may have greater incentives to be proactive in the job market. They may seek new and better job opportunities, which could allow for a quicker path to maximum employment following economic downturns. Further, individuals and households may hold additional savings for increased investments in human capital when mobility is relatively higher, allowing for more effective transmission of monetary policy. Stepping back, I pose this question not to offer a definitive answer, but rather to serve as one potential starting point for your discussions here today.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />Let me conclude by pointing out that the patterns we observe in our economy, including those for economic mobility, are not predetermined. Outcomes can and will change as we learn more about effective strategies to improve and maintain economic mobility in the U.S. By joining in these conversations here today, and by continuing to research and describe the patterns of economic mobility, you are helping society understand the dynamics of our economy better and find new and innovative ways to help keep the American dream of economic mobility alive and well. Thank you.</p>

<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. See Bernanke (2007), quoted text in paragraph 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. In figure 1, parent and child linkages and incomes are based on population-level tax data. The sample includes children born between 1980 and 1982. Parent income for these children is the average of total pretax family income when the child is between the ages of 15 and 19. Later-life income for these children is measured in 2014 when the child is between the ages of 32 and 34 and is defined as total individual pretax income. See Chetty and others (2020).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Earnings are, on average, just under $56,000 at the 80th percentile of the child earnings distribution, compared with just under $27,000 at the 50th percentile. See Chetty and others (2020).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Nominal wages in the figure are measured by the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker. Series show 12-month moving averages of the median percent change in the nominal hourly wage of individuals observed 12 months apart. Workers are assigned to wage quantiles based on the average of their wage reports in both the Current Population Survey and outgoing rotation group interviews. Workers in the lowest 50 percent of the average wage distribution are assigned to the bottom half, and those in the top 50 percent are assigned to the top half.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. There are limitations to this measure of higher education costs, as it is volatile and may not reflect the underlying net price that students pay. However, list tuition prices have been shown to be salient for many families when making college enrollment decisions. For example, see Bleemer and Zafar (2018).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. Despite the rising cost of college, research consistently shows a positive return to higher education for most students. See Wolla, Vandenbroucke, and Tucker (2023), Autor (2014), Zimmerman (2014), and Card (1999).&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, today announced that Bowmoor Capital, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">London</span>-based global macro investment advisor, and SummerHaven Investment Management, a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Connecticut</span>-based commodity-focused asset management firm, have deployed the new TT Futures TCA solution to inform their trade execution and algorithmic trading strategies and ensure they are achieving best execution on behalf of their clients.</p>
<p>First introduced last year, TT Futures TCA is a comprehensive transaction cost analysis (TCA) tool for futures trading, leveraging the largest collection of anonymized, aggregated microsecond-level futures market and trade data with a broad array of metrics and measures firms can use to customize the data for their unique purposes. Quantitative hedge funds and asset managers such as Bowmoor and SummerHaven can use the data for refining their strategies as well as for clients to confirm they are achieving best execution when invested in their managed funds.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Peter Weiler</span>, EVP Managing Director, Data &amp; Analytics at TT, said: "We're offering clients an unprecedented level of granularity on the wealth of futures trading data that's aggregated and anonymized by TT. It's great to see Bowmoor and SummerHaven applying these important analytical tools to their highly sophisticated trading and algo strategies, as well as to report to their clients how they are keeping costs low to maximize their returns."</p>
<p>Bowmoor Capital CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Richard Liddle</span>&nbsp;said: "We are honored to strengthen our longstanding relationship with Trading Technologies through this exciting new partnership. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in our commitment to innovation, leveraging advanced technology to enhance execution capabilities through the TT Futures TCA tools while driving the growth of our fund. We look forward to the transformative impact this project will have on our operations and the broader trading landscape."</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Kurt Nelson</span>, SummerHaven Co-Founder and Managing Partner, said: "We immediately saw the value of TT Futures TCA when the TT team demonstrated it. This is a valuable tool in our quest to achieve best execution for our clients, and this has traditionally been much harder to verify in futures than in equities."</p>
<p>TT Futures TCA is part of the firm's Data &amp; Analytics business, which builds on TT's 2023 acquisition of Abel Noser Solutions. In January, the firm launched TT Broker Scorecard, a first-of-its-kind monthly report ranking global and regional equity brokers by liquidity and execution quality. The report provides an independent proxy of the institutional market with rankings derived from the aggregated, anonymized trade data compiled by Abel Noser Solutions. The product will soon be available for futures.</p>
<p>TT Futures TCA includes depth-of-market views &ndash; important to futures market participants as they can assess their costs for trade execution vis a vis clearing costs. In the second quarter, the offering will also include futures pre-trade cost estimates based on extensive empirical data used to predict outcomes under similar market conditions based upon results from traders executing in similar contract sizes, types and market volatility.</p>
<p>Last year, Abel Noser Solutions won the Editors' Choice Award for TCA Provider of the Year in The TRADE's inaugural Leaders in Trading New York Awards as well as the award for Best Buy-Side TCA Tool in WatersTechnology's Buy-Side Technology Awards 2024.</p>

<title>ACER To Decide On The National Flexibility Needs Assessment Methodology</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 16 April 2025, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the European Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) submitted to ACER a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUlJUWQRdBUwJBwNaHVZbUVMdUw0FBxpRVlUPA1BQVlRUDlUdBAZWVwhSB1QdVg5XVx0GAQEDGgxcAw4ZAQdRU1JSUFZWUwJVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">joint proposal on the national flexibility needs assessment methodology</a>. The proposal defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the methodology for analysing national flexibility needs in electricity systems; and</li>
<li>the type of data to be gathered by system operators and in what format.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why national flexibility assessments matter</span></p>
<p>The national flexibility needs assessments aim to support Member States in identifying their indicative national targets for non-fossil flexibility (e.g. storage, demand response), ensuring their electricity systems remain secure and efficient during the energy transition.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER has three months, until 16 July 2025, to approve or amend the system operators&rsquo; proposal. Once approved, the methodology becomes binding for national assessments. Based on the national assessments (to be delivered by the national designated entities by July 2026), the Member States must set their national non-fossil flexibility targets within 6 months (by January 2027).</p>
<p>ACER will then review the national reports (by July 2027) and may provide recommendations on issues of cross-border relevance (including on removing barriers) to ensure sufficient non-fossil based flexible capacity is in place.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How does it link to the EU-wide flexibility assessment?</span></p>
<p>In parallel, to complement the national assessments, ACER is working on an EU-wide flexibility needs assessment, which will be published by July 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3rd edition of DFM&rsquo;s flagship Capital Market      Summit returns to Dubai on May 6-7, 2025, bringing together top international      and regional financial leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Summit will explore key trends shaping global      capital markets and the future readiness of markets amid evolving      financial dynamics.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>Over 1,500 participants, 100+ global speakers,      and 200 industry partners will convene at the region&rsquo;s leading capital      markets event to drive opportunity, growth, and future-ready strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dubai Financial Market (DFM) announced the agenda and speaker line-up for the upcoming 3rd MENA Capital Market Summit, which will take place on 6&ndash;7 May at Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai.</p>
<p>The 2025 edition will focus on the forces shaping global and regional capital markets, with sessions exploring the impact of technology on market infrastructure, IPO trends and high-growth company pipelines, cross-border capital flows, the rise of retail investors and the ongoing transformation of private markets.</p>
<p>These themes will be addressed by over 100 senior market leaders, including <b>H.E. Helal Saeed Almarri</b>, Director General of Dubai&rsquo;s Department of Economy and Tourism and Chairman of DFM; <b>Ken Robins</b>, Head of EMEA Equity Capital Markets at Citi; <b>Richard Cormack</b>, Head of ECM and Convertibles in EMEA and Co-Head of UK Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs; and <b>Simon Williams</b>, Chief Economist CEEMEA at HSBC, and <b>Lord Stephen A. Carter,</b> Group Chief Executive, Informa PLC. The programme includes keynote speeches, panel discussions and sector-specific sessions featuring speakers from across financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and government, and is expected to convene over 1,500 participants, and around 200 industry partners.</p>
<p>As Dubai continues to solidify its position as a global financial hub, the Capital Market Summit Series serves as a vital space for collaboration, policy dialogue, and deepening regional and international investment ties. With a growing IPO pipeline, rising investor participation, and rapid fintech advancements, the Summit plays a strategic role in driving market development and ensuring the future readiness of capital markets.</p>
<p>In addition to the main agenda, this year&rsquo;s Summit will introduce The Hub, a new dynamic space designed to foster practical engagement and focused dialogue. It will host partner presentations, fireside chats and panel discussions, alongside demonstrations of DFM&rsquo;s investor platforms, including the iVestor App and ARENA. The Hub will also feature sessions led by DFM and its partners, offering insights into the services shaping Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets today as well as the future initiatives designed to drive continued market growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Similar to last year, the Summit is supported by Platinum Sponsors &ndash; Bank of America, Citi, Emirates NBD and HSBC &ndash; with senior executives from each institution contributing to the programme.</p>
<p><b>Andree Chakhtoura</b><b>, Head of Investment Banking MENA, Bank of America, said</b>: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets continue to grow in scale and sophistication, creating new opportunities for both issuers and investors. As a long-standing partner to the region, we&rsquo;re proud to support the Capital Market Summit and engage in forward-looking conversations on market development, innovation, and the future of global investment flows. This year&rsquo;s Summit reflects a maturing regulatory landscape, increased participation, and deeper access to capital&mdash;marking a pivotal moment in the region&rsquo;s integration into global markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Achintya&nbsp;Mangla, Citi&rsquo;s Head of Financing for Investment Banking, said: </b>&ldquo;We are pleased to continue our partnership with the Dubai Capital Market Summit this year. Dubai continues to stand out as one of the most vibrant markets globally, offering strong growth and investment opportunities. As a trusted partner in key landmark transactions, we are dedicated to supporting the UAE&rsquo;s evolving financial landscape and strengthening investor engagement. This Summit is an important platform to share insights on IPOs, Capital Formation, and the evolution of markets, and we are proud to play a role in driving that dialogue forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Al Qassim, Group Head of Wholesale Banking, Emirates NBD</b>, said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit is firmly established as one of the premier events on the banking and financial services calendar. The 2025 edition is another important opportunity to leverage Dubai&rsquo;s evolving position as a major hub for international banking services, diverse investment, and the integration of the latest digital technologies. Our participation, and ongoing support, for CMS reflects Emirates NBD&rsquo;s role at the forefront of a rapidly changing investment landscape and an opportunity to showcase to an influential and innovative global audience the successes that continue to drive markets in Dubai, across the region, and beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mohamed Al Marzooqi, CEO, HSBC Bank Middle East, UAE, said: </b>&ldquo;International investors are increasingly looking towards the UAE and the Middle East for long term growth. The country&rsquo;s deepening capital markets, and strong international connectivity are driving expansion and creating new opportunities. At HSBC we continue to play a key role in the development of the country&rsquo;s equity and debt capital markets. Of the c.USD26.2 billion raised in IPOs in the UAE&rsquo;s financial markets between 2022&ndash;2025, HSBC was involved in 65% of total deal value. As the direction of global capital shifts eastwards, the Dubai Financial Market Summit acts as an essential platform for fostering collaboration, innovation, and unlocking new opportunities that will shape the future of financial markets across the Middle East.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming edition builds on a period of steady growth and heightened regional activity, while also reflecting the broader evolution of market expectations. With greater participation, maturing regulatory frameworks, and expanding access to capital, the Summit offers an opportunity to take stock of where the region stands &ndash; and where it&rsquo;s headed &ndash; in the context of a more connected global market.</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of DFM and Nasdaq Dubai,</b> said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a global financial gateway, where international capital meets regional opportunity. With AED 10.48 billion raised through IPOs in 2024 and an investor base of 1.2 million participants from over 200 nationalities, we&rsquo;re seeing clear evidence of growing global confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets. This momentum reflects the strength of our financial ecosystem and the clarity of our long-term vision: to scale access, drive innovation, and lead the region in capital market development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>''The third Capital Market Summit this year arrives at a pivotal time for our region, as global markets adapt to evolving economic dynamics, technological disruption, and shifting investor behavior. The 2025 edition will convene a broad spectrum of market leaders to explore how innovation, cross-border collaboration, and regulatory evolution can unlock new opportunities for capital formation and investment. I&rsquo;m particularly looking forward to the exchange of ideas and perspectives that will emerge &ndash; insights that will inform how we evolve, adapt, and lead in a fast-changing financial landscape.''&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Iress (ASX:IRE) today announces it has entered into a binding share sale and purchase agreement to divest its European headquartered low-latency market data business, QuantHouse, to BAHA Tech Holding AG (BAHA). BAHA is a privately-owned, Vienna-based market data provider founded in 1995. It provides real-time market data, financial news, technology and solutions for the financial services industry covering over 12 million financial instruments on more than 150 exchanges.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The decision to divest the QuantHouse business follows a strategic review Iress conducted as part of its transformation program. The review determined that Iress was not the natural owner of QuantHouse, and it would perform better under renewed ownership with the capacity and intent to invest in delivering specialist market data offerings at scale to global clients. Iress will retain its traditional market data offering as part of its Trading &amp; Market Data business.</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA is to pay Iress &euro;17.5m (A$31.4m) in cash consideration before costs upon completion, subject to customary working capital adjustments, warranties and indemnities. As part of the transaction, Iress has also agreed to a five-year supply agreement with BAHA to provide existing QuantHouse market data feeds into Iress&rsquo; software.</span><br /><br /><span>Completion of the sale is subject to BAHA ensuring it has the necessary market data agreements in place to ensure seamless continuity of service to QuantHouse clients. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed by the end of the year. Following completion, Iress will continue to provide certain services for a period of up to 12 months to assist in the transition to BAHA&rsquo;s ownership.</span><br /><br /><span>Iress Group CEO, Marcus Price, said: &ldquo;With our transformation program now complete, Iress is focused on strengthening and growing our core business operations in Wealth and Trading &amp; Market Data. While QuantHouse has been a valuable part of our business, we recognise its future potential will be best realised with an owner committed to investing in its global expansion.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are delighted that BAHA shares this vision and is the ideal owner to support QuantHouse in its next phase of growth. This transition represents an exciting opportunity for clients and employees, and we are committed to ensuring a seamless handover and continued collaboration in the future.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA founder and President Christian Baha, said: &ldquo;We welcome the QuantHouse team as a new part of the BAHA family. QuantHouse will continue to operate under its strong brand as an independent unit.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The BAHA offering now includes a comprehensive portfolio of high-end institutional information services including the BAHA terminal workstation, an independent proprietary global newswire, a leading consolidated global data feed and high-quality time series data sets critical for back testing and compliance requirements.</span><br /><br id="isPasted" /><span>&ldquo;Combined with QuantHouse, which has built an excellent reputation as a pioneering provider of low latency real-time market data for over 21 years, we look forward to expanding together as an innovative company that will revolutionise the high-end institutional financial market.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>This announcement was authorised by the Iress Board.</span></p>

<title>KB Asset Management To Launch KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF Tracking The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to continue its partnership with KB Asset Management with the upcoming launch of KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF, tracking the Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index. This ETF offers investors a comprehensive approach to the US natural gas sector, providing exposure to companies operating across the entire natural gas value chain, from production to infrastructure and export.</strong></p>
<p>As natural gas plays an increasingly central role in the global energy transition, the sector continues to attract the attention of investors worldwide. In 2024, global gas demand is expected to increase by approximately 2.8%, significantly outpacing the average growth rate for the decade, driven primarily by rising consumption in Asia. With long-term LNG demand bolstered by global energy security concerns and decarbonization efforts, investment in gas infrastructure, such as pipelines and LNG terminals, has accelerated. The United States has made decade-long investments in LNG facilities, reaffirming the strategic importance of natural gas in energy portfolios.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/kb-asset-management-to-launch-kb-rise-us-natural-gas-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-us-natural-gas-value-chain-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0P1U2">Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</a></strong>&nbsp;aims to capture the dynamic structure of this sector by identifying US-listed companies operating in three main categories: Production, Infrastructure, and Export. The companies are selected from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SLA3512">Solactive GBS North America All Cap Index</a></strong>&nbsp;and filtered according to strict liquidity and market capitalization criteria. Using ARTIS&reg;, Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing technology, the index ranks companies according to their relevance to each segment. The methodology ensures diversified exposure by selecting the five top-ranked companies per segment and weighting them based on free-float market capitalization, with segment allocations set at 20% for Export, 50% for Infrastructure, and 30% for Production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 22 April 2025 on the Korean Stock Exchange with ticker code 36Z0001.KS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>Our cooperation with KB Asset Management continues to grow. The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index provides investors with timely and relevant exposure to a critical component of the global energy mix by offering targeted exposure to the US natural gas value chain. In response to evolving market trends and investment objectives, we remain committed to providing innovative index solutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soojin Lee, Head of ETF Product Division at KB Asset Management, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It is our pleasure to extend our partnership with Solactive by launching the KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF. The ETF is designed to seek performance in both rising and falling natural gas price environments by structuring the natural gas value chain based on business revenue structures and diversifying across key companies in LNG exports (20%), production (30%), and infrastructure (50%).</em><em>&nbsp;We hope this ETF serves as a valuable tool for investors seeking strategic and balanced exposure to the natural gas industry.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today commenced the third cohort of its Shariah Mentorship Programme (SMP), aimed at nurturing a new generation of Shariah professionals in the Islamic capital market (ICM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event also celebrated 15 graduates of the second cohort of SMP, marking a significant step in the SC&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen Shariah talent development and governance in the ICM.</p>
<p>The SMP, funded by the Capital Market Development Fund (CMDF), was introduced by the SC in 2023. The mentorship initiative is run by ISRA Consulting, wholly owned by INCEIF University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme combines practical knowledge, industry exposure, and mentorship by members of the SC&rsquo;s Shariah Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Each cohort goes through an eight-month programme which includes three months of intensive classroom sessions, followed by five months of industry placements to gain hands-on experience in Shariah advisory within Islamic finance.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said SMP, one of the initiatives under the Capital Market Masterplan 3, will help nurture a sustainable Shariah talent pipeline and build industry capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a structured approach, SMP also aims to support the broader objectives of Maqasid al-Shariah by fostering values of integrity, ethics and sound judgement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are essential for Shariah advisory roles in order to serve the greater good of the market and society.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SC is also looking at the whole ecosystem beyond Shariah professionals to developing the next generation of Shariah scholars and the scope of their work, in order to solidify SC&rsquo;s leadership in this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To date, the SMP has produced 30 alumni where more than 70% of whom are now serving in various Islamic finance institutions. It is anticipated that the alumni will be registered as Shariah advisers with the SC in the next five years.</p>
