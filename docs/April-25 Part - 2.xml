<li>Over 1,500 participants, 100+ global speakers,      and 200 industry partners will convene at the region&rsquo;s leading capital      markets event to drive opportunity, growth, and future-ready strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dubai Financial Market (DFM) announced the agenda and speaker line-up for the upcoming 3rd MENA Capital Market Summit, which will take place on 6&ndash;7 May at Madinat Jumeirah, Dubai.</p>
<p>The 2025 edition will focus on the forces shaping global and regional capital markets, with sessions exploring the impact of technology on market infrastructure, IPO trends and high-growth company pipelines, cross-border capital flows, the rise of retail investors and the ongoing transformation of private markets.</p>
<p>These themes will be addressed by over 100 senior market leaders, including <b>H.E. Helal Saeed Almarri</b>, Director General of Dubai&rsquo;s Department of Economy and Tourism and Chairman of DFM; <b>Ken Robins</b>, Head of EMEA Equity Capital Markets at Citi; <b>Richard Cormack</b>, Head of ECM and Convertibles in EMEA and Co-Head of UK Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs; and <b>Simon Williams</b>, Chief Economist CEEMEA at HSBC, and <b>Lord Stephen A. Carter,</b> Group Chief Executive, Informa PLC. The programme includes keynote speeches, panel discussions and sector-specific sessions featuring speakers from across financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and government, and is expected to convene over 1,500 participants, and around 200 industry partners.</p>
<p>As Dubai continues to solidify its position as a global financial hub, the Capital Market Summit Series serves as a vital space for collaboration, policy dialogue, and deepening regional and international investment ties. With a growing IPO pipeline, rising investor participation, and rapid fintech advancements, the Summit plays a strategic role in driving market development and ensuring the future readiness of capital markets.</p>
<p>In addition to the main agenda, this year&rsquo;s Summit will introduce The Hub, a new dynamic space designed to foster practical engagement and focused dialogue. It will host partner presentations, fireside chats and panel discussions, alongside demonstrations of DFM&rsquo;s investor platforms, including the iVestor App and ARENA. The Hub will also feature sessions led by DFM and its partners, offering insights into the services shaping Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets today as well as the future initiatives designed to drive continued market growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Similar to last year, the Summit is supported by Platinum Sponsors &ndash; Bank of America, Citi, Emirates NBD and HSBC &ndash; with senior executives from each institution contributing to the programme.</p>
<p><b>Andree Chakhtoura</b><b>, Head of Investment Banking MENA, Bank of America, said</b>: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets continue to grow in scale and sophistication, creating new opportunities for both issuers and investors. As a long-standing partner to the region, we&rsquo;re proud to support the Capital Market Summit and engage in forward-looking conversations on market development, innovation, and the future of global investment flows. This year&rsquo;s Summit reflects a maturing regulatory landscape, increased participation, and deeper access to capital&mdash;marking a pivotal moment in the region&rsquo;s integration into global markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Achintya&nbsp;Mangla, Citi&rsquo;s Head of Financing for Investment Banking, said: </b>&ldquo;We are pleased to continue our partnership with the Dubai Capital Market Summit this year. Dubai continues to stand out as one of the most vibrant markets globally, offering strong growth and investment opportunities. As a trusted partner in key landmark transactions, we are dedicated to supporting the UAE&rsquo;s evolving financial landscape and strengthening investor engagement. This Summit is an important platform to share insights on IPOs, Capital Formation, and the evolution of markets, and we are proud to play a role in driving that dialogue forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Al Qassim, Group Head of Wholesale Banking, Emirates NBD</b>, said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit is firmly established as one of the premier events on the banking and financial services calendar. The 2025 edition is another important opportunity to leverage Dubai&rsquo;s evolving position as a major hub for international banking services, diverse investment, and the integration of the latest digital technologies. Our participation, and ongoing support, for CMS reflects Emirates NBD&rsquo;s role at the forefront of a rapidly changing investment landscape and an opportunity to showcase to an influential and innovative global audience the successes that continue to drive markets in Dubai, across the region, and beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mohamed Al Marzooqi, CEO, HSBC Bank Middle East, UAE, said: </b>&ldquo;International investors are increasingly looking towards the UAE and the Middle East for long term growth. The country&rsquo;s deepening capital markets, and strong international connectivity are driving expansion and creating new opportunities. At HSBC we continue to play a key role in the development of the country&rsquo;s equity and debt capital markets. Of the c.USD26.2 billion raised in IPOs in the UAE&rsquo;s financial markets between 2022&ndash;2025, HSBC was involved in 65% of total deal value. As the direction of global capital shifts eastwards, the Dubai Financial Market Summit acts as an essential platform for fostering collaboration, innovation, and unlocking new opportunities that will shape the future of financial markets across the Middle East.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming edition builds on a period of steady growth and heightened regional activity, while also reflecting the broader evolution of market expectations. With greater participation, maturing regulatory frameworks, and expanding access to capital, the Summit offers an opportunity to take stock of where the region stands &ndash; and where it&rsquo;s headed &ndash; in the context of a more connected global market.</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of DFM and Nasdaq Dubai,</b> said: &ldquo;The Capital Market Summit reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a global financial gateway, where international capital meets regional opportunity. With AED 10.48 billion raised through IPOs in 2024 and an investor base of 1.2 million participants from over 200 nationalities, we&rsquo;re seeing clear evidence of growing global confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets. This momentum reflects the strength of our financial ecosystem and the clarity of our long-term vision: to scale access, drive innovation, and lead the region in capital market development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>''The third Capital Market Summit this year arrives at a pivotal time for our region, as global markets adapt to evolving economic dynamics, technological disruption, and shifting investor behavior. The 2025 edition will convene a broad spectrum of market leaders to explore how innovation, cross-border collaboration, and regulatory evolution can unlock new opportunities for capital formation and investment. I&rsquo;m particularly looking forward to the exchange of ideas and perspectives that will emerge &ndash; insights that will inform how we evolve, adapt, and lead in a fast-changing financial landscape.''&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>Iress (ASX:IRE) today announces it has entered into a binding share sale and purchase agreement to divest its European headquartered low-latency market data business, QuantHouse, to BAHA Tech Holding AG (BAHA). BAHA is a privately-owned, Vienna-based market data provider founded in 1995. It provides real-time market data, financial news, technology and solutions for the financial services industry covering over 12 million financial instruments on more than 150 exchanges.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The decision to divest the QuantHouse business follows a strategic review Iress conducted as part of its transformation program. The review determined that Iress was not the natural owner of QuantHouse, and it would perform better under renewed ownership with the capacity and intent to invest in delivering specialist market data offerings at scale to global clients. Iress will retain its traditional market data offering as part of its Trading &amp; Market Data business.</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA is to pay Iress &euro;17.5m (A$31.4m) in cash consideration before costs upon completion, subject to customary working capital adjustments, warranties and indemnities. As part of the transaction, Iress has also agreed to a five-year supply agreement with BAHA to provide existing QuantHouse market data feeds into Iress&rsquo; software.</span><br /><br /><span>Completion of the sale is subject to BAHA ensuring it has the necessary market data agreements in place to ensure seamless continuity of service to QuantHouse clients. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed by the end of the year. Following completion, Iress will continue to provide certain services for a period of up to 12 months to assist in the transition to BAHA&rsquo;s ownership.</span><br /><br /><span>Iress Group CEO, Marcus Price, said: &ldquo;With our transformation program now complete, Iress is focused on strengthening and growing our core business operations in Wealth and Trading &amp; Market Data. While QuantHouse has been a valuable part of our business, we recognise its future potential will be best realised with an owner committed to investing in its global expansion.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are delighted that BAHA shares this vision and is the ideal owner to support QuantHouse in its next phase of growth. This transition represents an exciting opportunity for clients and employees, and we are committed to ensuring a seamless handover and continued collaboration in the future.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>BAHA founder and President Christian Baha, said: &ldquo;We welcome the QuantHouse team as a new part of the BAHA family. QuantHouse will continue to operate under its strong brand as an independent unit.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The BAHA offering now includes a comprehensive portfolio of high-end institutional information services including the BAHA terminal workstation, an independent proprietary global newswire, a leading consolidated global data feed and high-quality time series data sets critical for back testing and compliance requirements.</span><br /><br id="isPasted" /><span>&ldquo;Combined with QuantHouse, which has built an excellent reputation as a pioneering provider of low latency real-time market data for over 21 years, we look forward to expanding together as an innovative company that will revolutionise the high-end institutional financial market.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>This announcement was authorised by the Iress Board.</span></p>

<title>KB Asset Management To Launch KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF Tracking The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to continue its partnership with KB Asset Management with the upcoming launch of KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF, tracking the Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index. This ETF offers investors a comprehensive approach to the US natural gas sector, providing exposure to companies operating across the entire natural gas value chain, from production to infrastructure and export.</strong></p>
<p>As natural gas plays an increasingly central role in the global energy transition, the sector continues to attract the attention of investors worldwide. In 2024, global gas demand is expected to increase by approximately 2.8%, significantly outpacing the average growth rate for the decade, driven primarily by rising consumption in Asia. With long-term LNG demand bolstered by global energy security concerns and decarbonization efforts, investment in gas infrastructure, such as pipelines and LNG terminals, has accelerated. The United States has made decade-long investments in LNG facilities, reaffirming the strategic importance of natural gas in energy portfolios.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/kb-asset-management-to-launch-kb-rise-us-natural-gas-value-chain-etf-tracking-the-solactive-us-natural-gas-value-chain-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0P1U2">Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index</a></strong>&nbsp;aims to capture the dynamic structure of this sector by identifying US-listed companies operating in three main categories: Production, Infrastructure, and Export. The companies are selected from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SLA3512">Solactive GBS North America All Cap Index</a></strong>&nbsp;and filtered according to strict liquidity and market capitalization criteria. Using ARTIS&reg;, Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing technology, the index ranks companies according to their relevance to each segment. The methodology ensures diversified exposure by selecting the five top-ranked companies per segment and weighting them based on free-float market capitalization, with segment allocations set at 20% for Export, 50% for Infrastructure, and 30% for Production.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ETF listed on 22 April 2025 on the Korean Stock Exchange with ticker code 36Z0001.KS</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>Our cooperation with KB Asset Management continues to grow. The Solactive US Natural Gas Value Chain Index provides investors with timely and relevant exposure to a critical component of the global energy mix by offering targeted exposure to the US natural gas value chain. In response to evolving market trends and investment objectives, we remain committed to providing innovative index solutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Soojin Lee, Head of ETF Product Division at KB Asset Management, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It is our pleasure to extend our partnership with Solactive by launching the KB RISE US Natural Gas Value Chain ETF. The ETF is designed to seek performance in both rising and falling natural gas price environments by structuring the natural gas value chain based on business revenue structures and diversifying across key companies in LNG exports (20%), production (30%), and infrastructure (50%).</em><em>&nbsp;We hope this ETF serves as a valuable tool for investors seeking strategic and balanced exposure to the natural gas industry.</em><em>&rdquo;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today commenced the third cohort of its Shariah Mentorship Programme (SMP), aimed at nurturing a new generation of Shariah professionals in the Islamic capital market (ICM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event also celebrated 15 graduates of the second cohort of SMP, marking a significant step in the SC&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen Shariah talent development and governance in the ICM.</p>
<p>The SMP, funded by the Capital Market Development Fund (CMDF), was introduced by the SC in 2023. The mentorship initiative is run by ISRA Consulting, wholly owned by INCEIF University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programme combines practical knowledge, industry exposure, and mentorship by members of the SC&rsquo;s Shariah Advisory Council.</p>
<p>Each cohort goes through an eight-month programme which includes three months of intensive classroom sessions, followed by five months of industry placements to gain hands-on experience in Shariah advisory within Islamic finance.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said SMP, one of the initiatives under the Capital Market Masterplan 3, will help nurture a sustainable Shariah talent pipeline and build industry capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a structured approach, SMP also aims to support the broader objectives of Maqasid al-Shariah by fostering values of integrity, ethics and sound judgement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are essential for Shariah advisory roles in order to serve the greater good of the market and society.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SC is also looking at the whole ecosystem beyond Shariah professionals to developing the next generation of Shariah scholars and the scope of their work, in order to solidify SC&rsquo;s leadership in this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To date, the SMP has produced 30 alumni where more than 70% of whom are now serving in various Islamic finance institutions. It is anticipated that the alumni will be registered as Shariah advisers with the SC in the next five years.</p>

<p>Paul S. Atkins was sworn into office today as the 34th Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Chairman Atkins was nominated by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 9, 2025.</p>

Together we will work to ensure that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Pham. &ldquo;One evolving trend is the move to 24/7, 24/6, or 24/5 trading hours. I look forward to the public comments on this market innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>This request seeks comment on the implications of extending the trading of CFTC-regulated derivatives markets to an effectively 24/7 basis, including the potential effects on trading, clearing and risk management which differ from trading during current market hours. The request also seeks comment on the risks of 24/7 trading, and the associated clearing systems, including risks related to the areas of market integrity, customer protection, or retail trading.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Comments will be accepted until May 21. Comments may be submitted electronically through the CFTC Comments&nbsp;</span><a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7583">online process</a>.</p>
