<title>Artificial Fears And Human Intelligence: Remarks At The SEC Roundtable On Artificial Intelligence In The Financial Industry, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., March 27, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Thank you to staff from DERA and from all over the building for organizing this roundtable and thank you to all the panelists today for their participation in what I expect will be an enlightening and productive discussion. As we know, the securities industry has a long history of embracing new technologies to achieve greater efficiencies and lower costs: ticker, telephone, terminal, and now artificial intelligence. I look forward to hearing from the panelists about their deployment of AI, the benefits enjoyed, and the risks encountered.</p>
<p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence in broader society has often been discussed in sensationalist terms. Proponents tout its potential to revolutionize whole industries and opponents warn of its potential to devastate the workforce. The increasing use of artificial intelligence in the financial industry has not been immune from such thinking, and, regrettably, the Commission fell victim to the sensationalism when it attempted to broadly and clumsily regulate the use of predictive data analytics by broker-dealers and investment advisers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ai-roundtable-032725#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I am, by no means, foreclosing the idea that the use of artificial intelligence in the financial industry could pose risks to investors or market participants, and the Commission may have a role in resolving any such issues. But the Commission should not get lost in artificial fears. It should base any action on a thorough understanding of the particular AI problem it is trying to solve and why a regulatory solution to that problem is warranted. Approaching it this way is less daunting than trying to design a grand regulatory solution to respond to imprecise AI fears. It is also consistent with how we regulate humans, who are far more wonderful, intriguing, and complex than AI and who also can cause trouble.</p>
<p>Speaking of human trouble, I asked someone yesterday how her 4-year-old twins were doing, and she responded that they are a marvel: they absorb everything they see and hear and amalgamate these inputs with their own experiences to come up with amazing and surprising outputs. Sounds like AI, only better. Every human truly is a wonder on her own, and together we can accomplish even more. We also can accomplish yet more by combining our intelligence with artificial intelligence. This powerful combination will bring some new problems into the world, but also will generate solutions to those problems.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s roundtable is a great step toward a better understanding of artificial intelligence, its role in the financial industry, and how to think about regulating it. A better understanding can dispel unfounded fears and enable us to focus on real problems and to identify tailored solutions. To that end, I have several questions that the panelists may wish to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Normal2">What areas of the securities industry are likely to be most transformed by AI in the next five years? Should we do anything as a regulator to prepare for these changes?</li>
<li class="Normal2">Do firms need guidance from the Commission about their usage of artificial intelligence technology, and how should the Commission deliver such guidance?</li>
<li class="Normal2">Given the rapid pace of technological evolution in this space, how do we ensure that any potential Commission guidance or regulations related to the use of artificial intelligence do not quickly become outdated?</li>
<li class="Normal2">Relatedly, how do we ensure that our actions do not stifle innovation and remain technologically agnostic?</li>
<li class="Normal2">Finally, how do we avoid overreacting to the most egregious cases of artificial intelligence misuse and letting it define our rules and guidance?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-ai-roundtable-032725#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a draft technical package for version 4.1 of its reporting framework. This publication aims to provide an early version of the 4.1 release to facilitate the implementation for the reporting entities. The final version is expected to be released in end May 2025.</span></p>
<p>The draft technical package provides the standard specifications that include the validation rules, the DPM and the XBRL taxonomies to support the following reporting obligations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pillar 3 templates included in the comprehensive ITS on Pillar 3 disclosures, for the purpose of the Pillar 3 data hub.</li>
<li>Own initiative guidelines on reporting of data that competent authorities will need for the purpose of their supervisory tasks and for significance assessment (MiCAR reporting Guidelines).</li>
<li>Integration of Instant Payments reporting ITS into DPM and taxonomy</li>
<li>In addition, a series of validation rules have been added to the&nbsp;ESG ad-hoc data collection module.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background and next steps</h4>
<p>The final version of the technical package for the 4.1 reporting framework will be published in end May 2025 and will include possible corrections coming from the revision of the technical package by various stakeholders.</p>
<p>In June 2024, the EBA published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-its-plan-implementation-data-point-model-20" title="The EBA publishes its plan for the implementation of the data point model 2.0">plan for the implementation of DPM 2.0</a>.

This draft technical package includes a version of the data dictionary contents in both formats the DPM 1.0 and the new format DPM 2.0.</p>
<p>The FAQs published by EBA in December 2024 providing additional explanations on the transition to DPM 2.0 and new glossary period remain a good source of information and can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-releases-first-draft-technical-package-its-40-reporting-framework">here</a>.</p>

<title>ESMA Makes Recommendations For The Supervision Of STS Securitisations</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-03/ESMA42-2004696504-7945_STS_Securitisation_Peer_Review_Report.pdf">Peer Review Report</a>&nbsp;on National Competent Authorities&rsquo; (NCAs) supervision of Simple, Transparent and Standardised (STS) securitisations.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Report looks into and provides recommendations on the supervisory approaches adopted by selected NCAs when supervising STS securitisation transactions and the activities of their originators, sponsors and securitisation special purpose entities.</p>
<p>Verena Ross, Chair, said:</p>
<h6><em>&ldquo;In the ESMA Position Paper published in May 2024, ESMA called for measures to revive the EU securitisation market. It is therefore key to have in place a robust supervisory framework. In this first Peer Review conducted under the Securitisation Regulation, we welcome the early efforts and commitment of the NCAs assessed in implementing the STS securitisation supervisory framework.&nbsp; We also identify opportunities to further enhance national supervisory approaches.</em></h6>
<h6><em>The exercise is an opportunity for all EU authorities competent for STS supervision to learn from their peers and strengthen supervisory convergence. This is important for the effective implementation of the STS framework, which ultimately should assist to increase investors&rsquo; confidence in STS securitisation.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<h4><span>Key findings</span></h4>
<p>The Peer Review focused on four NCAs: AMF (France), BaFin (Germany), CMVM (Portugal) and DNB (the Netherlands).&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure effective supervision, all NCAs should implement an approach combining transaction-based and entity-based supervision tailored to the size of their securitisation market.</li>
<li>ESMA recommends that NCAs build on their existing efforts and expand their approach to ensure the risks arising from STS securitisation transactions are adequately identified, assessed and addressed; and</li>
<li>Some NCAs would benefit from introducing a more structured supervisory framework, a well-defined risk-based approach, and sufficient resources for STS supervision.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations are intended to support all EU NCAs, particularly those designated more recently or still awaiting designation. The NCAs are encouraged to continue monitoring the evolution of their STS markets and to adapt their supervisory approach and resource allocation as needed. This is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing fundamental review of the securitisation regulatory framework, with the aim to revive the securitisation market in the EU.</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p>ESMA will continue to facilitate and coordinate convergence work at the EU level. It expects to carry out a follow-up assessment in the future to evaluate progress made against the recommendations and track developments in STS supervision across jurisdictions.</p>
<h4><span>Background</span></h4>
<p>The Peer Review was conducted under the Securitisation Regulation, which mandated the review on the implementation of the STS criteria set out in its Articles 19 to 26. The Peer Review Committee carried out on-site visits and engaged with stakeholders. Before being approved by the ESMA Board of Supervisors, the Report underwent factual accuracy checks with the reviewed NCAs, and the ESMA Management Board ensured the consistent application of the Peer Review Methodology.</p>

<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-amman-stock-exchange-indices-quarterly-review-2025327/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The&nbsp;<span><span>Amman Stock Exchange&nbsp;(</span></span>ASE) has conducted the periodic quarterly review of the ASE indices constituents in purpose of ensuring that these indices reflect the market performance and the trading activity of the listed companies. By this rebalancing, the activity of listed companies in regard to trading during the last quarter has been reviewed. After that, the ASE has conducted its screening process for all listed companies based on the criteria used by the ASE represented by full market capitalization of the companies and the number of trading days during last quarter.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a result of this review, 6 companies have been excluded from the general index sample ASEGI and another 5 companies have been added. The companies that have been excluded from the index sample were: Jordan Dairy, Al-Amal Financial Investments , Al-Quds Ready Mix,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>Jordanian Expatriates Investment Holding, Comprehensive Multiple Transportations,</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>and Tuhama for Financial Investments.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>The companies that have been added to the index sample were: Arabia Insurance Company - Jordan, Jordan Vegetable Oil Industries, Jordan Insurance, Jordan International Insurance, and Aldaman for Investments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As part of the process, the ASE calculated the free float for all listed companies on the ASE based on the data received from the Securities Depository Center. Note that the ASE is setting a 10% cap for the company's weight in the index to prevent the index from being dominated by individual companies.</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the general index ASEGI, the full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 93.1% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE. The free float market capitalization of the index constitutes represents 95.1% of the total free float market capitalization of the listed companies on the ASE.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As for the</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>ASE20 index and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>ASETR index sample, one company has been excluded from the index sample, which is Arab Jordan Investment Bank, and another one company has been added to the sample, which is The Arab International for Education &amp; Investment.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>The full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 85.4% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE, while the free float market capitalization of these companies represents 87.6% of the total free float market capitalization of the ASE</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>listed companies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>In light of the above, the index constituents will be modified on the 3rd of April 2025. Interested parties can access the constituents of the index with the new weights through the following link:</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Under the Patronage of HRH Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, Lord Chamberlain - President of the Higher Council for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (HCD),&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>The Amman Stock Exchange (ASE), in collaboration with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), UN Global Compact Jordan (UNGCJ), and the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSE), proudly announces the 10<span>th</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;annual Ring the Bell (RTB) for Gender Equality event. This global initiative, taking place in 114 exchanges and CCPs worldwide, highlights the critical role of the private sector in advancing gender equality, empowering women in the workforce, and promoting inclusive and sustainable business practices.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Ring the Bell for Gender Equality initiative, led by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), has been raising awareness for gender equality across global stock exchanges for over a decade. The Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) has actively participated in this global campaign for the past ten years, demonstrating Jordan&rsquo;s commitment to promoting gender equality within its financial markets. Since first joining the initiative, ASE has consistently observed this annual event.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In 2022, ASE further strengthened its commitment by officially signing the Women&rsquo;s Empowerment Principles (WEPs). Continuing its dedication to gender equality, ASE hosted the 10th Annual Ring the Bell for Gender Equality under the patronage of HRH Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein. Held in celebration of International Women&rsquo;s Day (IWD) 2025, this global initiative highlighted the private sector&rsquo;s critical role in advancing gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>year&rsquo;s theme, "For ALL Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment," emphasized the need for systemic change to protect women's rights, break down barriers to leadership, and ensure equal opportunities in the workplace and beyond.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In his opening remarks, H.E. Mr. Mazen Wathaifi, CEO of Amman Stock Exchange, emphasized that empowered women play a pivotal role in community and societal development. Women&rsquo;s perspectives can bring crucial insight to industries across the board. Women champion positive changes in areas like health, education, and overall societal well-being. They can not only influence change on an individual and collective level but also inspire those around them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>"Increasing economic opportunities for women is essential for driving growth&nbsp;in Jordan. Today&rsquo;s event demonstrates our commitment towards this goal as we join forces with the Amman Stock Exchange and the private sector to recruit, retain, and promote more women in the workforce," said Khawaja Aftab Ahmed,&nbsp;Regional Director for the Middle East, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Mr. Nicolas Burniat , UN Women Representative to Jordan, shared that "Globally, women hold less than one-third of leadership positions in financial services. This is a clear sign of how women still do not have equal access to opportunities.&rdquo; He emphasized that change &ldquo;starts with recognizing the impact of women&rsquo;s leadership; when women lead, businesses perform better, innovation thrives and economies grow. The private sector has the power to drive this change, and we see it in action with more than 190 companies in Jordan joining our WEPs network, signaling a commitment to progress. But this is just the beginning. The private sector holds the key to creating workplaces where women can rise and lead without barriers. True economic growth isn&rsquo;t just about numbers; it&rsquo;s about people. And economies reach their full potential only when we leave no talent behind."</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Achieving gender equality is not just a moral imperative&mdash;it is an economic and business necessity. At the UN Global Compact Network Jordan, we believe that empowering women in the workplace, marketplace, and community is key to driving sustainable growth and innovation. With more than 190 companies in Jordan committed to the Women&rsquo;s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), we are witnessing a shift toward more inclusive business environments. However, there is still work to be done. By integrating gender equality into corporate strategies, fostering inclusive leadership, and ensuring equal opportunities, the private sector can be a powerful force for change. Together, we can build a future where women and girls are not just participants, but leaders in shaping Jordan&rsquo;s economy and society.&rdquo; said Mr. Jamal Fariz, UN Global Compact Network Jordan.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The event featured a panel discussion where RTB partners, private sector leaders, and gender equality advocates shared best practices and strategies for fostering inclusive workplaces. Moderated by Dr. Rasha Dayyat, Director of the Planning and Institutional Development Department at the Amman Stock Exchange, the discussion included key speakers namely Mr. Nicolas Burniat, UN Women Representative, H.E. Mrs. Nadia Alsaeed, CEO at Bank Al Etihad, Mr. Samer Al Madhoun, Managing Partner at Muhakat Institute and UNGCJ Board Member, and Mr. Muhannad Jarrah, Business Development Executive Director at INJAZ.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span><span>The event contributed to Jordan's ongoing efforts to create an inclusive, equitable, and sustainable business environment for women and girls. It aligned with national priorities, including Jordan&rsquo;s Economic Modernization Vision, and supported the global push for gender equality in the corporate sector. The event emphasized the critical role of businesses in fostering inclusive workplaces and creating equitable opportunities for women and girls in Jordan.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Remarks At The SEC Roundtable On Artificial Intelligence In The Financial Industry, Mark T. Uyeda, SEC Acting Chairman, SEC Roundtable On Artificial Intelligence In The Financial Industry, Washington D.C., March 27, 2025</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-sec-roundtable-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-financial-indust-2025327/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, and welcome to the SEC&rsquo;s roundtable on artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ai-roundtable-032725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Thank you for joining us today, both in-person and virtually, for this event. We have invited experts from a wide variety of stakeholders to help educate us on developments in AI, possible use cases for AI in the financial industry, and AI&rsquo;s potential benefits and risks.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence involves the use of interrelated technologies to accomplish tasks that previously required human intelligence. However, the incorporation of technology into the financial markets is not new.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ai-roundtable-032725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;From stock ticker machines to telephones to computerized networks, the U.S. financial markets have consistently advanced using technological innovations. Our ability to innovate is a fundamental reason why our cost of capital tends to be the lowest in the world and why our capital markets are unmatched in terms of their size, depth, and liquidity. During the SEC&rsquo;s 90-plus year history, it has consistently dealt with technological changes affecting the financial markets.</p>
<p>Various forms of AI have been used in financial products and services for decades. The use of these technologies has led to enhancements in trading and investing as well as in financial products and processes. Recent developments &ndash; driven by ideas, investment, and competition &ndash; have enabled new ways for market participants and investors to interact with AI and the markets and have led to an expanding realm of potential uses cases in financial products and services.</p>
<p>Tools incorporating these AI technologies can help digest and extract insights from vast and diverse datasets and other information, leading to enhanced decision-making and operational efficiencies. Advancements in AI are being tested and deployed in applications such as internal task automation, coding, investor communications, and risk management. These technologies may enhance investor interactions and learning and can assist regulators in improving the efficiency of their supervisory and oversight activities.</p>
<p>Financial regulators should take a technology-neutral approach to regulation. I have been concerned with some recent Commission efforts that might effectively place unnecessary barriers on the use of new technology.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ai-roundtable-032725?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;We should avoid an overly prescriptive approach that can lead to quickly outdated, duplicative rules, a &ldquo;check the box&rdquo; approach to compliance, and impediments to innovation. To the extent that advances in technology, such as AI, create potential gaps in our regulatory structure or point to the need for additional guidance, it is the Commission&rsquo;s responsibility to address those gaps or provide guidance in ways that encourage innovation while protecting investors. The Commission must be mindful of its statutory authority and prioritize effective and cost-efficient regulations in this space.</p>
<p>As with other financial innovations, the use of AI also may bring risks and challenges. AI is a broad term, but risks from the use of AI technologies may largely depend on the specifics of the technology, use case, and deployment at issue. As we evaluate potential risks and challenges arising from the use of AI, we should focus on obtaining relevant data and evidence. To foster a commonsense and reasoned approach to AI and its use in financial markets and services, regulators should be engaging with innovators, technology providers, market participants, and others.</p>
<p>Today is one such engagement. Thank you to the panelists for your time and effort in preparing for this roundtable. Thank you also to the Division of Economic Risk and Analysis, the Division of Examinations, the Office of Support Operations, and the Office of Public Affairs, and the many other Commission staff members who made today&rsquo;s event possible. I look forward to the discussion. &nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, and Circle Internet Group, Inc., a global financial technology company and stablecoin market leader, today announced an agreement whereby ICE plans to explore using Circle&rsquo;s stablecoin USDC, as well as tokenized money market offering US Yield Coin (USYC), to develop new products and solutions for its customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s reputation and global network across markets offer a unique pathway for Circle to integrate USDC into major new use cases, and we are thrilled for the opportunity to innovate together,&rdquo; said Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder and CEO of Circle.</p>
<p>Lynn Martin, President of the New York Stock Exchange, said, &ldquo;We believe Circle&rsquo;s stablecoins and tokenized digital currencies can play a larger role in capital markets as digital currencies become more trusted by market participants as an acceptable equivalent to the US Dollar. We are excited to explore the potential use cases for USDC and USYC across ICE&rsquo;s markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Circle&rsquo;s USDC is a fully reserved stablecoin, otherwise known as a digital dollar, and is designed to maintain price equivalence to the US dollar. According to Circle, as of March 26, 2025, over $60 billion of USDC is in circulation. USDC reserves are backed by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets making USDC redeemable 1:1 for US dollars.</p>
<p>The majority of the USDC reserve is invested in the Circle Reserve Fund (USDXX), an SEC-registered 2a-7 government money market fund. Launched in 2018, USDC is now accessible to approximately 600 million end-user wallet products, supporting a range of use cases from crypto capital markets activities to dollar store of value, and payments applications.</p>
<p>Under the MoU, Circle and ICE plan to collaborate to explore applications for using Circle&rsquo;s stablecoins and other product offerings within ICE&rsquo;s derivatives exchanges, clearinghouses, data services, and other markets, to deliver innovation and build new markets and product offerings based on Circle&rsquo;s products.</p>

<title>FSB Announces Establishment Of The Forum On Cross-Border Payments Data</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-announces-establishment-of-the-forum-on-cross-border-payments-data-2025327/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today announced the establishment of a Forum on Cross-Border Payments Data. This initiative is a key outcome from the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/recommendations-to-promote-alignment-and-interoperability-across-data-frameworks-related-to-cross-border-payments-final-report/">Recommendations for data frameworks</a>&nbsp;related to cross-border payments that were published in December 2024, and forms part of the FSB&rsquo;s increasing emphasis on promoting implementation of its policy recommendations.</p>
<p>Differences in laws, regulations, and practices between countries can create unnecessary frictions in cross-border payments, increasing costs and risks for businesses and individuals. By bringing together experts in payments, anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing, sanctions, and data privacy and protection, the Forum will work to strengthen cooperation on data-related issues in cross-border payments, such as the way data is collected, stored and managed across borders.</p>
<p>Working with competent international organisations, including with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD), the forum will serve as a platform for dialogue, information exchange, and research, helping to identify and address inconsistencies in global data frameworks. An advisory body comprised of private sector representatives will also be created to provide industry perspectives and expertise to the Forum.</p>
<p>Its first meeting will be held in May and will be chaired by Gianmatteo Piazza of the Bank of Italy.</p>

<ul>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>BMLL historical options data to complement Exegy&rsquo;s real-time OPRA data</span></em></strong></span> </li>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Collaboration cements existing partnership and paves road for continuing integration, providing excellent data and services for global market participants</span></em></strong></span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>BMLL Technologies (BMLL), the leading, independent provider of harmonised, Level 3, 2 and 1 historical data and analytics to the world&rsquo;s financial markets, and Exegy, the only firm delivering comprehensive, front-office solutions for market data and trading across the latency spectrum, today announced that it has expanded its partnership for historical OPRA options data.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In a move designed to enhance OPRA options trading, Exegy and BMLL Technologies have deepened their partnership, delivering a unified data stream that seamlessly bridges real-time and historical market data. This collaboration is the logical next step in&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.exegy.com%2Fexegy-selects-bmll%2F/1/01020195d69f37dc-5f45033e-6f7f-4c66-b0b4-437ef9621d11-000000/guaSA3mIOHhqDvrOiCqxofKEtuo=419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Exegy&rsquo;s existing partnership with BMLL</span></a><span>, which started in Q3 2023 after the release of its latest ticker plant platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The initial partnership with BMLL provided a competitive advantage to quantitative traders by enabling them to take granular, historical data from a best-of-breed provider to fine-tune algos and use the data in Exegy&rsquo;s back-testing and simulation solutions to accelerate alpha discovery and deploy strategies with improved speed and accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span><span>BMLL has recently added&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bmlltech.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases-and-news%2Fbmll-expands-coverage-with-addition-of-us-equity-options-data/1/01020195d69f37dc-5f45033e-6f7f-4c66-b0b4-437ef9621d11-000000/n3xmTaunlSt3Ddnt7vqb8e7Mth8=419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>US Equity Options data</span></a><span>&nbsp;to its</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>historical offering, utilizing</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Exegy&rsquo;s Axiom as its trusted, real-time data source for one of the industry&rsquo;s largest and most complex datasets. Processing OPRA data presents significant data engineering hurdles, requiring substantial resources and delaying time-to-market for critical trading strategies. This partnership directly addresses these challenges.</span></span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Further, BMLL&rsquo;s new OPRA options data offering leverages Exegy&rsquo;s conflation algorithm to enable clients of both firms to consume consistent, high quality, conflated real-time and historical data.&nbsp; The matching conflation algorithms dramatically reduce the engineering steps required for users to go to production by providing data alignment between both services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Exegy and BMLL plan to continue expanding their mutual support in 2025 by integrating the BMLL Data Feed into the Exegy XCAPI API.&nbsp; Mutual clients will be able to seamlessly transition between historical data research to real-time production systems without complex data mapping and translation processes, notably improving the speed, scale and accuracy of their work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, said:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;In November 2024 we announced the availability of six years of historical, nanosecond unconflated&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bmlltech.com%2Fnews%2Fpress-releases-and-news%2Fbmll-expands-coverage-with-addition-of-us-equity-options-data/2/01020195d69f37dc-5f45033e-6f7f-4c66-b0b4-437ef9621d11-000000/hoJUn2kSGbaWzM7ONRalMc8teO0=419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>OPRA options data</span></a><span>&nbsp;in a cloud-based environment via BMLL Data Lab and BMLL Data Feed through Amazon&rsquo;s AWS S3. In addition, BMLL can also conflate OPRA data at speeds required by our customers and partners, mapping our data to the format of Exegy&rsquo;s real-time data. This means that if clients are backtesting historical data and find alpha, they can quickly and efficiently replicate that format in the real-time world.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We are very excited to join forces and match Exegy's real-time expertise with BMLL's historical capabilities. Jointly we are offering a unique transformational product to market participants, helping them understand liquidity dynamics and make better-informed trading decisions at speed and scale.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>David Taylor, Chief Executive Officer, Exegy:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;We are excited to strengthen our partnership with BMLL Technologies, enhancing the value we bring to our clients. BMLL&rsquo;s use of our trusted real-time OPRA data in its</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>historical dataset underscores the quality and reliability of our solutions. We look forward to continuing our collaboration, empowering clients with robust tools for comprehensive research, backtesting, and more informed trading strategies.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span>OPRA aggregates and disseminates pricing information for listed Options contracts in the U.S., including quotes, last sale prices, and volume data. OPRA participants include BOX, Cboe BZX Options, Cboe C2 Options, Cboe EDGX Options, Cboe Options Exchange, Miami International Securities Exchange, MIAX Emerald, MIAX PEARL, Nasdaq BX, Nasdaq GEMX, Nasdaq ISE, Nasdaq MRX, Nasdaq PHLX, The Nasdaq Stock Market, NYSE American and NYSE Arca.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today released a revised version of the Guidelines on Advertising for Capital Market Products and Related Services.</p>
<p>The Guidelines was revised to update certain requirements and guidance taking into account advertising and promotional trends globally and domestically, including the growing prominence of social media and financial influencers (finfluencers).</p>
<p>This is towards ensuring responsible advertising activities in relation to capital market products and services.</p>
<p>The revised framework will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>new requirements relating to finfluencers who are not engaged as marketing agents by an advertiser yet on their own accord undertake advertising activities for any capital market products and services. They will be subject to the requirements under the Guidelines as they would be regarded as advertisers for the purposes of the Guidelines; </li>
<li>enhancement of requirements relating to advertisers&rsquo; duty to ensure the advertising activities conducted by their marketing agent comply with the Guidelines. The advertisers will otherwise be held accountable for the conduct of their marketing agent; and &nbsp;</li>
<li>enhancement of requirements relating to use of social media to address its growing use for financial promotions. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Guidelines will also impose a prohibition against advertising services in Malaysia, of persons who are not authorised by the SC.</p>
<p>The Guidelines is part of the SC&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to promote responsible advertising on new channels of advertising such as social media, ultimately protecting investors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reviewing and formulating the revised Guidelines, the SC has, amongst others, benchmarked against other jurisdictions such as Australia, the UK and Singapore, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>considered the feedback received from engagement with relevant stakeholders including finfluencers.</p>
<p>The revised Guidelines will come into effect on 1 November 2025 to allow sufficient time for advertisers to familiarise and make the necessary preparations to meet the new requirements.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the relevant stakeholders may engage the SC for any clarification and guidance relating to the revised Guidelines. Any queries on the revised Guidelines may be submitted to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AdGuidelines@seccom.com.my</span>.</p>

<title>Miles To Go: Remarks Before The Digital Chamber's 8th Annual DC Blockchain Summit, Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., March 26, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Preston [Pysh], for that introduction. Before I begin, let me remind you that my views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>The poems of Robert Frost, born on this day in 1874, were among those that filled my childhood. I memorized &ldquo;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;a poem about a traveler, accompanied only by his hesitant horse, stopping to admire the falling snow in the forest. Although lyrical verses of securities law have since largely displaced more traditional poetry in my mind&rsquo;s cluttered recesses, the closing stanza of Frost&rsquo;s poem hangs on:</p>
<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br />But I have promises to keep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep,<br />And miles to go before I sleep.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Other Frost poems might better capture the season: spring&rsquo;s flowers are upon us, and crypto winter has given way to a sometimes too ebullient season. Nevertheless, Frost&rsquo;s desire to pause the journey to watch the falling snow cover the forest floor resonates with me; I would like the luxury of stopping for a moment or more to watch and think in quiet solitude about what a beautiful regulatory framework would look like. But I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep, so I am pondering in public, as the Commission and its staff are working on building the framework. I invite you to join us in determining how to get from regulatory desolation to a place where the crypto industry can blossom without the weeds of fraud, grift, and market manipulation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the public already has stepped up to assist in the task. The Crypto Task Force has had many helpful meetings with outside parties,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and we already have received approximately fifty thoughtful written submissions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The Task Force&rsquo;s first public roundtable last Friday was a productive conversation among thoughtful experts with varied views. Additional roundtables are on the schedule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;All of this engagement is extremely helpful, as we consider how the Commission and its staff can provide clarity about what is outside of our jurisdiction and practical compliance solutions for activities that are within our jurisdiction. For example, as the discussion at our recent roundtable highlighted, the Commission needs to think separately about transactions and assets that are the subject of transactions. Many crypto assets themselves are not securities, but primary offerings of crypto assets for capital raising purposes are securities transactions. Accordingly, staff is open to inquiries about how to conduct such offerings as either registered or exempt transactions. And the Task Force welcomes well-reasoned requests for no-action letters or exemptive relief that can be finalized quickly to allow activity to start soon. Lessons learned from these short- and medium-term efforts can inform longer-term regulatory and legislative efforts.</p>
<p>We also need to think now about the longer term and do so with open, inquisitive minds. What type of regulatory framework should Congress and the regulators be crafting? How do novel offering and trading technologies fit with our statutes? How can the transparency of the blockchain, the automated operation of smart contracts, and other aspects of crypto technology facilitate regulatory compliance? What new uses for crypto assets and the technology underlying them will emerge&mdash;including uses outside the financial realm, particularly once the securities label is not reflexively affixed to every crypto asset? Given all of these outstanding questions, in regulating financial crypto, we ought not be bound by the way we have long regulated existing financial markets. We should welcome the opportunity to reevaluate existing regulation in the light of these questions to ensure its appropriateness for both traditional and new markets.</p>
<p>The SEC and other regulators can provide technical advice and reflections such as those I offer today, but Congress&mdash;not implementing agencies&mdash;writes the statutes. Two market structure bills from the last Congress&mdash;the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (&ldquo;FIT21&rdquo;), which passed the House,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which was introduced in the Senate,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-dc-blockchain-summit-032625#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;are informing work during this Congress. Under both approaches, the SEC and the CFTC, each of which has relevant experience, would have a role to play.</p>
<p>As a potential implementer of the legislative design who has lived through past implementation efforts involving multiple regulators, I cannot help but pay attention to jurisdictional questions. The jurisdictional status quo is a challenge. SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, FTC, OFAC, banking regulators, state regulators, FINRA, international regulators, and more play a role in crypto regulation. Overlapping jurisdiction can strain the brains, bank accounts, and briskness of both regulators and market participants. The overlap is likely only to get worse because crypto assets can represent anything from cash, to a financial instrument, like a security or a futures contract, to a work of precious art. As a result, many different regulators will have an interest in regulating crypto as it intersects with their jurisdiction. The risk of burdensome overlaps and conflicts is, therefore, real.</p>
<p>Congress can mitigate regulatory overload in a number of ways. First, as it seems inclined to do, Congress can work with existing regulators rather than creating a new one. Second, Congress can make clear that any new statute applies only domestically, which will focus U.S. regulatory resources on platforms set up in the United States&mdash;or reaching into the United States&mdash;to serve U.S. customers. Third, when interstate commerce is involved, as it clearly is here, Congress can preempt state regulation over areas covered by federal regulators to alleviate overlap with 50 state regulators. Fourth, to reduce regulatory uncertainty and the regulatory disputes that arise from such uncertainty, Congress can clearly assign jurisdiction over particular types of crypto assets to particular federal regulators. These four approaches to minimizing jurisdictional overlap are pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Three other approaches for mitigating burdens in a crowded regulatory field are a bit more involved. The fifth way to mitigate burdens would permit flexibility relating to where crypto assets can trade. For this discussion, let us assume that, under new legislative authority, the CFTC will regulate platforms that trade either exclusively non-security crypto assets or a mix of non-security crypto assets and other instruments already regulated by the CFTC. Congress could make clear that a crypto asset sold in a primary transaction conducted pursuant, for example, to an SEC safe harbor, could trade on secondary markets on a CFTC crypto asset trading platform, unless the asset itself&mdash;apart from the investment contract&mdash;is a security.</p>
<p>While nothing in the SEC&rsquo;s statutes or regulations currently prevents non-securities from trading alongside securities, some people might dispute the SEC&rsquo;s authority to regulate transactions that have no security component, even if they occur on SEC-regulated platforms. Congress could expressly authorize exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems (&ldquo;ATSs&rdquo;) regulated by the SEC to trade non-security crypto assets and give the SEC explicit authority to regulate these transactions. Congress could ensure that the SEC&rsquo;s regulatory and enforcement authority extended to all transactions occurring on one of its registered platforms. This approach would offer market participants the opportunity to decide where best to house their crypto asset trading activities and would dispel difficult operational questions about transitioning assets from one type of regulated platform to another. Customers would benefit, too, as SEC registrants could have integrated backends for all the crypto assets, securities and non-securities, that they make available to customers, potentially leading to increased efficiencies and lower costs for end-users.</p>
<p>A sixth way Congress could mitigate the burden of regulatory overlap is to apply lessons from the SEC&rsquo;s and CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory experience in traditional markets to the regulation of crypto assets and the platforms where they trade. We can draw on the principles that have guided SEC and CFTC regulation over the past decades, while making changes where appropriate to address the unique features and risks of these assets and to excise extraneous requirements that have accreted over the years without proportionate benefit for investors and markets. Crypto trading platforms could register as something more akin to an ATS than a national securities exchange. Principles-based regulation would give them broad latitude in making decisions about the products they offer for trading and how such products trade. Trading platforms would be able to serve retail customers directly. Customer protections could include proof of reserves and Exchange Act Rules 15c3-1 and 15c3-3 to protect custodied assets; allowance of atomic settlement to remove credit and counterparty risks; customer priority in bankruptcy and insolvency; information barriers and other protections to guard customer trading information from affiliates, employees, and other customers; electronic disclosure of transaction costs; and the provision of standardized, material information about crypto assets by the trading platform. Regulators would have the ability to monitor and examine trading platforms and bring enforcement actions for violations of customer protection rules, insider trading, and disclosure violations.</p>
<p>Finally, Congress can mitigate concerns about regulatory overlap and burden by safeguarding a basic American liberty&mdash;the right to transact with one&rsquo;s peers. Protecting people&rsquo;s ability freely to interact directly with one another, including through software, will provide a healthy check on regulatory accretion at centralized trading platforms and serve to acknowledge software developers&rsquo; First Amendment rights. Centralized intermediaries are not going away. Welcoming the entrepreneurs who are building to disintermediate and decentralize finance is consistent with fundamental American values. It also helps to appropriately calibrate regulation of centralized intermediaries; if regulation of centralized intermediaries is too heavy, too light, or simply not right, people will be able to use decentralized and disintermediated alternatives.</p>
<p>While this moment calls for us to think about crypto market structure, perhaps these discussions also will help us to rationalize the regulatory framework for our traditional equity markets that has grown in regulatorily micromanaged complexity over the last ninety years. Blockchain technology might even be an agent in that streamlining initiative. But I will save those musings for a subsequent journey when there is time to stop and think in the quiet solitude of an ivory tower. As I mentioned at the outset, the task at hand requires greater alacrity and less solitude. Although we have some hard miles ahead in our journey, together we can make rapid progress. A well-crafted regulatory edifice lies just on the other side of the forest.</p>

<p><span><span>&ldquo;Protecting whistleblowers from retaliation, incentivizing qualified whistleblowers with timely awards, and prohibiting companies from muzzling would-be-whistleblowers are the three core features of the SEC Whistleblower Program.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the Basel III capital reforms are finalized for implementation in key jurisdictions, ISDA is maintaining a laser focus on making sure the rules are robust and risk-appropriate. Simply put, if capital requirements are set disproportionately high, this will have serious consequences for the thousands of companies that rely on banks for financing and hedging solutions.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Basel III market risk framework, known as the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), most regulators have deviated from the global standards when drafting their rules, which suggests there may be flaws in the original calibration. Rectifying those flaws is a step in the right direction, which is why we welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC) consultation, launched this week, to gather feedback on possible changes to the FRTB.</p>
<p>The FRTB is currently due to be implemented in the EU from January 1, 2026, but that&rsquo;s a year earlier than the current deadline in the UK and there is no clarity at this stage on when US policymakers will finalize and implement the rules. Citing the need to avoid penalizing internationally active EU banks and preserve their ability to compete with third-country banks, the EC is consulting on three possible options &ndash; implement the FRTB as planned, delay by one year until the start of 2027, or apply a set of targeted amendments for a three-year period.</p>
<p>Those targeted amendments comprise 10 possible changes that could be made to the FRTB&rsquo;s standardized and internal models approaches. Although designed to be temporary, many of these changes address issues that ISDA has long advocated to resolve. They would improve the risk sensitivity of the framework and result in more appropriate capital requirements.</p>
<p>For example, the EC has proposed that the profit-and-loss attribution test under the internal models approach could be used as a monitoring tool until the start of 2029. ISDA had previously highlighted the difficulties posed by this test and the instability of the resulting capital requirements. The proposed reprieve would allow data to be collected initially so the impact can be carefully monitored over time.</p>
<p>The EC has also recognized the punitive impact of the additional capital charge for non-modellable risk factors and proposed the application of a discount factor over a three-year period. Further analysis will be needed to determine if the discount is appropriately calibrated or whether alternative solutions are warranted, but this measure would certainly reduce the punitive capital impact of NMRFs.</p>
<p>Another welcome change is the proposal to assign a 0% risk weight to sovereigns in the default risk charge for both the standardized and internal models approaches, subject to supervisory approval. This would remove the disproportionate treatment of sovereigns when using internal models and reduce one of the impediments for banks to use their own models for market risk capital. This is a simple solution to a longstanding issue.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments also include improved recognition of diversification in the standardized approach and a more pragmatic approach to the capitalization of equity investments in funds, an issue ISDA has been working with members to address for some time.</p>
<p>ISDA commends the EC for its willingness to revisit the standards, and we hope it will lead to an improved regulatory framework for market risk capital in the EU. As we work with our members to respond to the consultation, we&rsquo;ll also continue to engage with regulators in other jurisdictions. We must maintain our focus on a global capital framework that is risk-appropriate for both standardized and internal models.</p>

<title>EBA Identifies Payment Fraud, Indebtedness And Unwarranted De-Risking As Key Issues Affecting Consumers In The EU</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today the 9th edition of its biennial Consumer Trends Report for 2024/25. The Report has identified payment fraud, indebtedness, and unwarranted de-risking as the most important issues affecting EU consumers. The Report is based on information provided by the national authorities of the 27 EU Member States, selected national and EU consumer associations, EU industry associations, national ombudsmen, as well as quantitative data from a variety of sources, including for the first time the EBA&rsquo;s new Retail Risk Indicators, which the EBA publishes separately since 2022 with a view to identify potential consumer harm.</span></p>
<p>The Report concludes that payment fraud is still the most significant issue for EU consumers. This also reflects the emergence of new types of fraud, such as social engineering techniques. In this type of scams, payers are manipulated into making a payment to the fraudsters, who have adapted their techniques to elude the application of the strong customer authentication requirements imposed by EU law.</p>
<p>Indebtedness emerges as the second most relevant issue, with a significant rise of what is commonly referred to as &lsquo;Buy-Now-Pay-Later&rsquo; credit and other types of small, fast, accessible and short-term credit. Inadequate creditworthiness assessment practices of lenders and poor disclosure of pre-contractual information are found to be key drivers to indebtedness.</p>
<p>Unwarranted de-risking is the third most relevant issue, with more consumers facing increased difficulties in opening and retaining payment accounts, access to which is a prerequisite for residents in the EU to be able to participate in the EU economy. This issue materialises in the form of refused onboarding of new and the offboarding of existing consumers and seems to be affecting mostly specific categories of vulnerable consumers, i.e., migrants, refugees, the homeless, cross-border workers, and individuals with poor financial histories.</p>
<p>Following these findings, the EBA will consider which actions to take in 2025/26 to address the topical issues identified in 2024/25 and with the aim of further enhancing consumer protection across the EU.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The Consumer Trends Report 2024/25 has been developed in fulfilment of the EBA&rsquo;s mandate set out in Article 9(1) of its founding Regulation, which requires the Authority to take a leading role in promoting transparency, simplicity and fairness in the market for consumer financial products or services across the internal market, including by collecting, analysing and reporting on consumer trends.</p>

<ul>
<li>Basel&nbsp;III risk-based capital ratios increase in the first half of 2024.</li>
<li>Banks' leverage ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) remain stable while Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) decreases slightly.</li>
<li>Redesigned dashboards offer new features to explore results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basel&nbsp;III risk-based capital ratios increase while leverage ratio and NSFR remain stable for large internationally active banks in the first half of 2024, according to the&nbsp;<span>latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d592.htm"><span class="firstword">Basel</span>&nbsp;III monitoring exercise</a></span>, published today.</p>
<p>The report, based on data as of 30 June 2024, sets out trends in current bank capital and liquidity ratios and the impact of the fully phased-in Basel III framework, including the December 2017&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm"><span>finalisation of the Basel III reforms</span></a>&nbsp;and the January 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.htm"><span>finalisation of the market risk framework</span></a>. It covers both large international active banks (Group 1) and other smaller banks (Group 2). See note to editors for definitions.</p>
<p>The implementation of the final elements of the Basel III minimum requirements began on 1&nbsp;January 2023. At the end of the first half of 2024, the average impact of the fully phased-in final Basel&nbsp;III framework on the Tier 1 minimum required capital (MRC) of Group&nbsp;1 banks was +1.9%, compared with +1.3% at end-December 2023. Group&nbsp;1 banks report a minor regulatory capital shortfall of &euro;0.9 billion, compared with no shortfall at end-December 2023.</p>
<p>The monitoring exercise also collected bank data on Basel III liquidity requirements. The weighted average LCR decreased slightly compared with the previous reporting period to 136% for Group 1 banks. Three Group&nbsp;1 banks reported an LCR below the minimum requirement of 100%.</p>
<p>The weighted average NSFR was stable at 124% for Group&nbsp;1 banks. All banks reported an NSFR above the minimum requirement of 100%.</p>

<p>The report is accompanied by interactive Tableau&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/dashboards.htm"><span class="firstword">dashboards</span></a>&nbsp;that allow users to explore the results with greater ease and flexibility. A new design makes the dashboards more user-friendly, and the explanatory text summarising the findings was expanded to cover additional topics including market risk, counterparty credit risk and credit valuation adjustment risk.</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>Background</em></h4>
<p><em>Through a rigorous reporting process, the Basel Committee regularly reviews the implications of the Basel&nbsp;III standards for banks and has been publishing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/qis/"><span class="firstword">results</span>&nbsp;of such exercises</a>&nbsp;since 2012.</em></p>
<p><em>The results shown for "current Basel III framework" reflect the current jurisdictional standards that apply to the reporting banks as of 30 June 2024, which reflect different degrees of implementation of the Basel III reforms. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_reports.htm"><span class="firstword">Basel</span>&nbsp;III implementation dashboard</a>&nbsp;provides an overview of Basel III implementation status across jurisdictions. The results shown for "fully phased-in final Basel III framework (2028)" assume that the positions as of 30&nbsp;June 2024 were subject to the full application of the Basel III standards. That is, they do not account for transitional arrangements set out in the Basel III framework, which expire on 1 January 2028. No assumptions were made about bank profitability or behavioural responses, such as changes in bank capital or balance sheet composition. For that reason, the results of the study may not be comparable with industry estimates.</em></p>
<p><em>Data are provided for 176 banks, including 115 large internationally active banks. These "Group&nbsp;1" banks are defined as internationally active banks that have Tier 1 capital of more than &euro;3 billion and include 29 institutions that have been designated as global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The Basel Committee's sample also includes 61 "Group 2" banks (ie&nbsp;banks that have Tier&nbsp;1 capital of less than &euro;3 billion or are not internationally active).</em></p>
<p><em>The values for the previous period may differ slightly from those published in the previous report. This is caused by data resubmissions for previous periods to improve the underlying data quality and enlarge the time series sample as well as by a change in methodology as explained in the report.</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Treasury Department announces today the formal publication of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/26/2025-05199/beneficial-ownership-information-reporting-requirement-revision-and-deadline-extension">interim final rule</a>&nbsp;that removes the requirement for U.S. companies and U.S. persons to report beneficial ownership information (BOI) to FinCEN under the Corporate Transparency Act and narrows the scope of the rule to foreign reporting companies. This publication in the Federal Register follows FinCEN&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-removes-beneficial-ownership-reporting-requirements-us-companies-and-us">announcement</a>&nbsp;on March 21, 2025, that it is issuing this interim final rule. The interim final rule is effective immediately. FinCEN is accepting comments and intends to finalize the rule this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to rein in burdensome regulations to the benefit of hard-working American taxpayers and small businesses,&rdquo; said U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. &ldquo;As we continue to re-leverage the private sector and de-leverage the government, we are reviewing all regulations to ensure they are fit-for-purpose, in furtherance of our ambitious economic growth agenda on behalf of the American people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The action follows the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s March 2, 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0038" target="_blank">announcement</a>&nbsp;suspending enforcement of the Corporate Transparency Act.</p>

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2.2% year on year to PLN 163.7 million.</p>

</ul>
<p><span>Record revenue</span></p>
<p>Despite volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, 2024 was marked by solid investor activity on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. GPW Main Market EOB equity turnover reached PLN 331.4 billion, an increase of 20.7% year on year. This excellent performance stands out in Europe. According to FESE, GPW recorded a 26.8% increase in turnover in euros in 2024, the highest percentage increase in turnover among exchanges with annual turnover above EUR 2 billion. Among European Economic Area exchanges, GPW reported the second highest velocity ratio at 39.1%.</p>
<p>GPW Group revenue increased by 4.5% in 2024 to a record high of PLN 464.8 million. This was driven by a 9.8% YoY increase in the Financial Market, while the Commodity Market dropped by 2.7% YoY. Revenue from information services on the Financial Market increased by 11.4% YoY to reach a record level of PLN 65.2 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We are proud of the record revenue of the GPW Group generated thanks to solid growth on the Financial Market. This is a result of high turnover on the equity market combined with continued growth of revenues from information services which are not directly dependent on trading volumes on the financial market and build resilience to capital market cycles. It is a major achievement that operating expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue growth last year,</em>&rdquo; said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>EBITDA adjusted for one-off events amounted to PLN 163.7 million in 2024, up by 2.2% YoY. Adjusted net profit amounted to PLN 157.7 million in 2024, up by 2.1% YoY.</p>
<p><span>IPO recovery</span></p>
<p>Last year brought a breakthrough in the IPO market. The nine IPOs on the GPW Main Market included the record-breaking listing of the Żabka Group, which was the fourth biggest IPO in the history of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the tenth biggest IPO globally in 2024 with a value of PLN 6.45 billion. The other 8 IPOs were transfers from the alternative market NewConnect to the Main Market, reflecting the maturity of the companies and their ambition to continue to grow in a larger and more competitive market. The December listing of Neptis on the Main Market was the 100th transfer in the history of NewConnect, a market where 13 companies were newly listed in 2024. The total value of IPOs, SPOs, and ABBs in 2024 increased by 122% YoY to PLN 15.8 billion.</p>
<p>2024 was not only a year of records on the equity market. Catalyst, which celebrated its 15th anniversary, also picked up. In total, PLN 36.2 billion worth of non-Treasury bonds were introduced to Catalyst in 2024, an increase of 84.2% YoY. Catalyst currently lists 774 series of PLN-denominated bonds issued by 140 entities, and the total value of the listed bonds is approaching PLN 1.5 trillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The sentiment in the Polish IPO market in early 2025 is moderately positive. One clear sign of improved sentiment is the recent success of the large IPO of Diagnostyka, which was welcomed by investors. GPW follows the European trend of cautious optimism, although the number and value of IPOs in Poland are still below the European average,</em>&rdquo; said GPW Management Board Member Michał Kobza.</p>
<p><span>New Strategic Directions</span></p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group&rsquo;s New Strategic Directions 2025-2027 were published in November 2024. The strategy is based on two complementary priorities: developing the capital market and building shareholder and stakeholder value with the support of modern technology.</p>
<p>The year 2024 was a time of intensive work on the technological development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. GPW took a range of initiatives related to the implementation of the trading system WATS and its integration with trading-related systems. We set a deadline of 10 November 2025 for the roll-out of GPW WATS and we launched a test version of the system for Exchange Members.</p>
<p>The Management Board reviewed non-core projects and the opportunities and conditions for their further commercialisation. As a result, GPW had to recognise impairment losses which reduced consolidated EBITDA of the Group in 2024 by PLN 38.6 million. On the other hand, we released a significant provision for potential VAT liabilities in IRGiT, amounting to nearly PLN 32 million. The balance of these one-off events adversely impacted the reported results but did not cause any cash outflows and will not affect the dividend payment for the past financial year.</p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange was actively involved in capital market development initiatives in 2024. At the local level, GPW coordinated a working group which presented a number of proposed changes to the Polish capital market. GPW participated in the work and consultations of local bodies on changes to the capital market, including the regulation of REITs and UCITS ETFs.</p>
<p>On the international level, together with six CEE exchanges and the EBRD, the Warsaw Stock Exchange signed a memorandum to strengthen the integration of the regional capital markets. In December 2024, together with key financial institutions in Poland, GPW published a position paper on the development of European capital markets. In early 2025, GPW hosted the European Capital Market Forum as part of active participation in the dialogue on the future of the Savings and Investments Union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>What is key for investors is the long-term outlook. We are optimistic about the long term due to the expected structural changes on the capital market in Poland and the European Union, which we see as opportunities for the Warsaw Stock Exchange,</em>&rdquo; said GPW President Tomasz Bardziłowski.</p>

<title>Fivecast Revolutionises Financial Crime Investigations With AI-Driven Online Insights - Speed And Accuracy Of Fivecast’s Digital Intelligence Platform Transform Compliance And Risk Exposure Amid Increased Regulatory Pressure And A Renewed Global Clampdown On All Types Of Money Laundering</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fivecast-revolutionises-financial-crime-investigations-with-ai-driven-online-ins-2025326/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Fivecast today launched its cutting-edge,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fhubs.ly%2FQ03ddVZr0/2/01020195d1bf23ea-3e14c338-125f-4ed9-aa2d-2e245e56c960-000000/po5XILVrUsdJ6W4skGiuJaAABkc=419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AI-driven digital intelligence platform</a>&nbsp;into the financial crime compliance market, enabling financial institutions to radically streamline financial crime investigations, anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and enhanced due diligence (EDD) through online data analytics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fivecast empowers financial investigation teams to swiftly and efficiently assess customer risk across masses of online information. As a global provider of market-leading open-source intelligence (OSINT) software, Fivecast&rsquo;s AI and machine learning capabilities have demonstrated a nearly four-fold increase in efficiency compared with conventional manual approaches to KYC/EDD and AML investigations, delivering faster results, boosting productivity, and reducing compliance costs for financial institutions worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span>The need for accurate, timely, and global data has never been greater. The global regulatory landscape is rapidly changing, demanding new data sources to meet evolving due diligence requirements for AML compliance. This is highlighted in the European Union&rsquo;s expanded guidance and definitions pursuant to EU AMLD6, along with unprecedented consent orders from the US Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Australian Government&rsquo;s AUSTRAC guidance for AML/CTF obligations.</span></p>
<p><span>The Fivecast platform delivers relevant and actionable information from a vast range of online data sources, enabling broad digital footprint discovery combined with in-depth, AI-driven multi-media data analysis. Current sources and methods used for financial intelligence investigations, by contrast, are missing critical, risk-based information about customers, leading financial institutions to grossly underestimate their risk exposure.</span></p>
<p><span>Fivecast solutions empower financial investigation units to efficiently and accurately assess a customer&rsquo;s risk profile to rapidly identify predicate crimes and customer risk exposure and adopt a genuine risk-based approach to compliance while minimising compliance costs.</span></p>
<p><span>The increase in judgments for AML non-compliance and the changing regulatory landscape are pushing financial institutions to explore new innovative technologies to address these many challenges. In 2024, global penalties related to financial crime imposed by U.S. regulators surpassed&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.corporatecomplianceinsights.com%2Fnews-roundup-january-24-2025%2F/1/01020195d1bf23ea-3e14c338-125f-4ed9-aa2d-2e245e56c960-000000/oLIf10WrIe5nQcPjJqiabclrvJw=419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">$4.3 billion</a>. Notably, TD Bank, the sixth-largest bank in North America, incurred $3 billion in fines for AML non-compliance, particularly for gaps in their due diligence programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Duane Rivett, Fivecast Co-founder and VP of Strategic Growth, said: &ldquo;The vastly superior speed and accuracy of our digital intelligence platform streamlines slow, labor-intensive processes in a highly sensitive area for financial institutions. Some banks employ thousands of analysts to perform enhanced due diligence and investigate money laundering or terrorism financing. Just as national security agencies use our products to analyse extremist or terrorist networks online, banks are doing the same with a slightly different focus.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>This latest product release from Fivecast showcases the company&rsquo;s commitment to delivering cutting-edge open-source intelligence technology innovations to customers, as evidenced by the recent&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fivecast.com%2Fnews%2Ffivecast-wins-australian-government-department-of-defence-award%2F/1/01020195d1bf23ea-3e14c338-125f-4ed9-aa2d-2e245e56c960-000000/C2HcXMykn3HU73yXDuwLF4-qQx8=419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">award from the Australian Government Department of Defence</a>&nbsp;for Innovation in Science and Technology. Fivecast is committed to being at the forefront of applying the latest technology innovations to open-source intelligence solutions to help their customers enable a safer world.</span></p>

<p>The country that levied the most was the United States, which ordered banks to pay a total of $4.08 billion&mdash;90.67% of the $4.5 billion total&mdash;across 19 penalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United Kingdom took second place, levying the payment of $261.68 million across 10 fines.</p>
<h3>These are the biggest bank fines of 2024</h3>
<p>The bank fined the most was the Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank), which was fined $3.09 billion due to a multi-agency investigation into improper controls that enabled the corporation&rsquo;s American subsidiary to launder illicit funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The penalties levied against TD Bank announced on October 10, account for 68.67% of all 2024 fines in the sector.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the most common violation in 2024 was the breach of anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The bank that paid the second-largest fine of $348.20 million&mdash;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co&mdash;was penalized for &lsquo;an inadequate program to monitor firm and client trading activities for market misconduct.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the relevant violation was ongoing for nearly a decade, from 2014 to 2023. The fine was announced on March 13, 2024.</p>
<h3>UK and Sweden follow US&nbsp;in bank fine totals</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, British and Swedish regulators enforced the two biggest individual penalties outside the US.</p>
<p>In January 2024, the UK&rsquo;s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) fined HSBC Bank $74.12 million for failing to implement depositor protection. In the last months of the year, Sweden penalized Klarna Bank AB for AML violations to the tune of $46 million.</p>
<p>Klarna is set to conduct its initial public offering (IPO) in 2025 and is expected to remedy its AML situation. However, Erik Blomm&eacute;, the Director of Sweden&rsquo;s Money Laundry Supervision, highlighted that the ruling was not an injunction and that, therefore, there is no clear timetable.</p>
<h3>US levies 90% of the penalty amount but accounts for only 33% of the fines</h3>
<p>Lastly, though the fine sizes in 2024 have been lopsided with the US in a clear lead, watchdogs across the globe have been active. As Andreja Stojanovic, a co-author of the report, pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While the US has levied an outsized proportion of the total value of penalties, the share of individual fines imposed in the country&mdash;33% with 19 out of the total 57 fines recorded&mdash;is more appropriate, possibly even downscaled given the fact the country is home to more than 4,000 banks."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting outlier in the statistics has been China. Despite having the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy by nominal gross domestic product (GDP), it imposed only three fines in 2024 and, levying a total of $31.22 million, came in behind both Sweden and Finland in terms of the total penalty amount.</p>

<title>ING’s Climate Targets Validated By The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, we announced that the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated our climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations and in our client portfolio. In our client portfolio, the SBTi validated the fossil fuel, power generation, cement, steel, automotive, aviation, and commercial real estate sector targets.</p>
<p>The SBTi has concluded that the emission reduction targets - which we use to steer our climate goals - are in line with the latest science and the goal of limiting global warming to internationally agreed levels. The SBTi validated ING&rsquo;s target against its<span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc x_normal x_OWAAutoLink" href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/Financial-Institutions-Near-Term-Criteria.pdf" id="OWAf50ddbfc-458a-e3e9-46c1-53b7653ba6b5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/Financial-Institutions-Near-Term-Criteria.pdf">Financial Institutions Near-term Criteria</a></span></span>, which is a global framework for financial institutions&rsquo; near-term target-setting in line with climate science.</p>
<p>The SBTi is an organisation that has enabled over 7,400 companies worldwide to set science-based targets (SBT). It was established by CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and as one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments.</p>
<p><b>Nate Aden, Head of Financial Standards at SBTi</b>, said:&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;As the first global systemically important bank with a validated science-based target, ING is showing how large financial institutions can support climate stabilisation in the real economy. This target builds on years of ING leadership on sector-level benchmarking - the combination of six sector targets with cross-portfolio fossil fuel targets sets a new precedent for climate leadership. ING&rsquo;s science-based target marks an exciting milestone in the SBTi&rsquo;s mission to drive science-based climate action across the global economy.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><b>Anne-Sophie Castelnau, Global Head of Sustainability at ING,&nbsp;</b>stated:&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;Having our climate targets validated by the SBTi demonstrates that they are science-based and robust. We will continue to engage with clients and support them in driving down emissions, keep building up the financing of new technologies and sustainable systems of the future, and find ways to include everyone and enable them to play their part in the transition.&rdquo;</i></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to collaborate with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to host WEF&rsquo;s first-ever financial services event in Hong Kong today (Wednesday).</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems 2025 Symposium welcomed top business and public leaders, tech pioneers and academics from around the world to discuss global themes and megatrends that are particularly relevant to Asia today; these include emerging technologies, fintech, growth financing and sustainability.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Held at HKEX Connect Hall, the Symposium kicked off with welcome remarks by&nbsp;</span><span>Carlson Tong, Chairman of HKEX, followed by a fireside chat featuring distinguished speaker Paul Chan, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong SAR. The conference was co-chaired by Bonnie Y Chan, Chief Executive Officer of HKEX, together with corporate leaders Jenny Johnson, President and CEO of Franklin Templeton Investments; Fred Hu, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Primavera Capital Group; and Rishi Kapoor, Vice-Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of Investcorp.<br /></span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">Carlson Tong, Chairman of HKEX, said: &ldquo;We are delighted to be strengthening our long-term partnership with the World Economic Forum by bringing this important global dialogue from Davos to Hong Kong. Hosting the Symposium in our home city demonstrates the enduring strength and resilience of its markets, as well as the integral role that it plays in shaping the future of global finance. This event presents us with a unique opportunity to bring Asian perspectives to the forefront, and we look forward to furthering our collaboration with international partners to explore solutions to key global issues.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Matthew Blake, Head of the Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems, World Economic Forum, said: &ldquo;</span><span>With the world today facing significant uncertainty due to geopolitical, technological, and economic shifts, it's essential leaders in financial services come together to address these challenges. As a critical bridge to APAC, a region home to 60% of the world's population and accounting for US$40 trillion in GDP, Hong Kong is an ideal location to host the World Economic Forum's inaugural Centre for Financial and Monetary Systems 2025 Symposium.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Bonnie Y Chan, Chief Executive Officer of HKEX, said: &ldquo;Asia&rsquo;s extraordinary growth has helped position the region as a leading global economic powerhouse, propelled by China&rsquo;s advancements in innovation and sustainability. As a key financial market infrastructure, HKEX is committed to connecting global capital with the region&rsquo;s opportunities, which is more important than ever in our rapidly changing world. Today&rsquo;s discussions are an important reminder of the significance of continued dialogue and connectivity, and we look forward to working closely with the World Economic Forum to bring global conversations to Asia and driving sustainable progress in the financial services sector.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Today, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFBwACUlUFBkwAUwIBHVZfUAMdU1hVXxpRUwtWDFVUUwcJAFcdBFEHWAADVlAdWwoHAh0GDghTGlQHCg4ZBAcGUwMBBwcFUlVVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report on electricity network tariff methodologies</a>. This report analyses how network tariffs are set across the EU and how network costs are allocated across different network users (e.g. generators, consumers, battery facilities or other storage operators). It also enhances transparency in electricity network tariff setting by sharing national practices and offers insights into several tariff challenges faced by regulators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How is it relevant to the European Commission&rsquo;s Action Plan for Affordable Energy?</span></p>
<p>Network charges finance the operation and upgrade of the power grid. ACER has repeatedly flagged that, for EU competitiveness, network costs need to be contained as they are one of the main drivers of electricity costs.</p>
<p>Action 1 of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXV1dQWVdSVkxaDw1RHVYIDFUdUwoDAxoGVldSBgNWAABXBFAdBFEHWAADVlAdWwoHAh0GDghTGlQHCg4ZBAcGUwMBBwcFUlVVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">European Commission&rsquo;s Action Plan for Affordable Energy</a>&nbsp;(February 2025) is to make electricity prices more affordable. The ACER tariff practices report, which emphasises fair and cost-reflective electricity network tariffs, is timely as the European Commission puts forward (Q2 2025) a design of tariff methodologies for network charges to incentivise the use of flexibility and investments in electrification.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s key messages?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the price signals right is key.&nbsp;As the energy transition advances, network costs are expected to rise and account for a bigger share of the electricity bill. Ensuring the network tariffs send the right price signals optimises grid use and keeps network costs down.</li>
<li>Containing the rise in network costs is important for EU competitiveness and affordable electricity. Future-proof measures should ensure all network users receive signals for flexibility and system efficiency.</li>
<li>Network tariffs should be cost-reflective to encourage users to adapt electricity generation and consumption.</li>
<li>Two-thirds of EU countries have recently made (or plan to soon make) major revisions to their network tariff methodologies. Many of these changes align with ACER&rsquo;s past recommendations.</li>
<li>Local power system context matters. No &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; solution&nbsp;can be easily found: this report presents select national practices from which regulators can draw inspiration to increase system efficiencies and keep electricity network costs down, tailoring them to local needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER offers&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTB1BXWAVSVUwOAFIHHVZfV1AdU11XUBoFXQBUUgQBDwZTUAkdBFEHWAADVlAdWwoHAh0GDghTGlQHCg4ZBAcGUwMBBwcFUlVVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">10 principles</a>&nbsp;for national regulatory authorities (NRAs) to consider when setting or approving their next transmission or distribution tariff methodologies. These aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance transparency and comparability of network tariff methodologies;</li>
<li>ensure non-discrimination among network users;</li>
<li>promote cost-reflectivity and efficient price signals; and</li>
<li>foster stakeholder engagement before major methodology revisions.</li>

<title>Meeting Expectations: Address By ASIC Commissioner Kate O’Rourke At The Australasian Investor Relations Association’s (AIRA) ‘Trends In AGM Practice And Shareholder Engagement’ Conference In Sydney On 26 March 2025</title>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a time of technological change and disruption, annual general meetings (AGMs) remain a key accountability mechanism for corporate Australia.</li>
<li>The ability of investors to engage with directors and management and hold companies to account is a fundamental driver of good corporate governance.</li>
<li>ASIC has released updated guidance on virtual meetings for companies and registered schemes to clarify expectations and support shareholder participation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4zopxrdz/kate-orourke-portrait.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=500" /></p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the lands on which we&rsquo;re meeting, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation.</p>
<p>I would also like to congratulate AIRA for hosting this inaugural conference. As Ian [Matheson, AIRA] mentioned, I&rsquo;ve been involved in other conferences that have been put on and I&rsquo;ve always found it really interesting and topical and on the pulse of what&rsquo;s happening in corporate Australia and investors and consumers, which is where ASIC focuses our attention.</p>
<p>I also wanted to say AIRA is good at writing very well-written, brief, and to the point submissions, so when I think about the Statutory Review and the communication of key issues, I think you do a great job, whether it be bringing it to Treasury and others&rsquo; attention issues that aren&rsquo;t always front of mind for people who are working in the policy and regulatory space. The corporate perspective, particularly your perspective, is always really welcome and well expressed, so thank you.</p>
<p>I will be responding to some of the issues that were raised through the Statutory Review and I think as the punchline, you&rsquo;re going to have mixed views about where we&rsquo;ve landed, but hopefully some of it is welcome. I am also keen to leave time for questions because it&rsquo;s great to hear people&rsquo;s views on things.</p>
<p>AGM best practice is a fantastic thing to focus on. Technology is entirely reshaping industries, businesses, and daily life &ndash; particularly in your profession. Today really is a great opportunity to reflect on the technology changes that affect AGMs more broadly and embrace them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To frame my discussion, I want to remind you of the phrase &ldquo;the medium is the message&rdquo;, which was coined by a Canadian communication theorist, Marshall McLuhan. At the time, the idea of &ldquo;the medium is the message&rdquo; was revolutionary because it recognises how and where something is said shapes what is said &ndash; and often speaks volumes more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where and how in our context for today is the AGM and that context really does affect what your CEOs, chairs, and other leaders in your organisations are conveying and also what they&rsquo;re hearing from your shareholders at the AGM.</p>
<p>Through that lens of the medium being the message, we can really see how important AGMs are as a powerful mechanism for facilitating good governance, even as technology disrupts and redefines how we communicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where else other than the AGM are leaders of businesses required to meet stakeholders &ndash; in this case, investors &ndash; to look them in the eye, and explain what they are doing? So that medium being the message is really important.</p>
<p>From ASIC&rsquo;s perspective, this ability of investors to engage with directors and management effectively, exercise their rights, and hold companies to account is a really fundamental driver of good corporate governance &ndash; and obviously good corporate governance is essential for the effective operation and performance of both companies, our market, and our economy. So that form &ndash; the AGM &ndash; really enables the function of governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There really are a lot of governance challenges in Australia at the moment. I don&rsquo;t want to get drawn on them particularly but that heightens the focus of AIRA today on AGMs and more generally on getting the fundamentals of governance right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve framed today&rsquo;s discussion as &ldquo;meeting expectations&rdquo; &ndash; both the verb and the noun &ndash; specifically how you as trusted advisers can support compliance with the regulatory requirements that apply in relation to AGMs in circumstances of technological change.</p>
<h2>The price of flexibility&nbsp;</h2>
<p>But first, a moment to step back in time. Last Thursday (20 March) was somewhat of an unsung anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It marked five years since ASIC first took steps to facilitate companies and registered schemes to hold virtual-only member meetings, in the beginning days of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was done by way of a no-action position if these entities could not otherwise comply with the Corporations Act requirements to hold virtual AGMs.</p>
<p>It was clear this flexibility was needed. We can all remember the challenges of that time, particularly in February, March, April. The dizzying series of &ldquo;unprecedented measures&rdquo;, borders being closed, the quick maths to determine how many people you could have in a room, including one supposed to be hosting an AGM.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pretty mind blowing at the time.</p>
<p>So that decision was pretty straightforward but it also proved to be a sensible first step into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century for company meetings, and we were really pleased at ASIC to see it later become a permanent feature of the Act in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many other pandemic-era developments, the expansion of virtual and hybrid AGMs has presented both benefits and challenges.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure you could talk to me about those in detail, we recognise that&rsquo;s been so. And like other reforms of this period, sometimes it&rsquo;s a little hard to tell at this point if it&rsquo;s a permanent shift or a pendulum swing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the one hand, the ability to hold hybrid and virtual meetings has really democratised and improved access to meetings and facilitated greater shareholder participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an outcome we support, given one of our objectives as a regulator is to promote the confident and informed participation of investors in the financial system. Supporting shareholders to exercise their rights is entirely consistent with that objective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, we are mindful that flexibility comes at a cost and can impose a burden. I note the representations from AIRA on this topic to the Statutory Review<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;consultation last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as an aside, I would like to mention to you that ASIC has recently convened a Simplification Consultative Group<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>. Our Chair Joe Longo spoke about it at our Annual Forum last year in which he stepped back as the regulator and looked at the regulatory framework &ndash; statutory instruments, guidance, info sheets, all these different elements &ndash; and reflected on the cost associated with very high levels of complexity in the frameworks we administer and that your companies are complying with.</p>
<p>Recognising that there&rsquo;s been efforts before &ndash; including by the Law Reform Commission and others &ndash; to think about regulatory complexity, we are starting an additional push to see what we can do at ASIC to achieve practical examples of simplification in relation to areas preferably within our gift. We create instruments, guidance, info sheets, surveillance data requests, so we are asking can we do them more simply or in a way that simplifies how they are felt by people who are receiving them?</p>
<p>But it will also generate some ideas about law reform as well and we can&rsquo;t do that &ndash; it&rsquo;s the parliament who does that. But we can act as a conduit between areas of the law and the legislative framework that are particularly complex and work up examples of why they are particularly problematic. &nbsp;We can contribute to that wider debate as well. So if there are people interested in that, I&rsquo;m happy to take that offline and take any questions on it, but I did want to let you know about that body of work in relation to simplification that ASIC has started.</p>
<p>Speaking of guidance though, I am pleased to announce today that in response to the recommendations of the Statutory Review of the Meetings and Documents Amendments and the Government&rsquo;s subsequent response<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>, ASIC has released updated guidance on virtual meetings for companies and registered schemes<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of that statutory review, there were a number of recommendations and one of them was directed to us &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll come back to it, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;us plus&rsquo; this idea of guidance being valuable in relation to AGMs.</p>
<p>The guidance further explains the amendments which permit hybrid and virtual only meetings and clarifies how ASIC views the law operating in certain areas. So, we did have some guidance but we&rsquo;ve enhanced it. We&rsquo;ve gone into some more detail on issues and made some adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically &ndash; and I think this might be one of the areas that&rsquo;s welcome &ndash; one of our FAQ updates notes that we do not view the Corporations Act as always requiring a telephone line, so long as the virtual meeting format allows members to exercise any rights orally and in writing, and the virtual meeting technology meets the broader requirements of meetings.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s something I think we heard from AIRA that was of particular concern, so we&rsquo;ve been pleased to clarify our thinking on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll recall what I mentioned earlier regarding the medium and the message. Where we&rsquo;ve come from in relation to that is [from the perspective of] is there another way, or a way in which people can ensure members have the ability to have their voice heard. For us, this is a compromise which balances the burden of compliance with the expectations of shareholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also clarified that providing a webcast of a meeting at a physical venue does not meet the requirements of a hybrid meeting.&nbsp;Our view is if that&rsquo;s the only piece of technology, that&rsquo;s not allowing a member to participate by asking questions or indeed by voting. That&rsquo;s the second clarification I wanted to highlight but there&rsquo;s others and I hope that&rsquo;s helpful. There is more information available in the guidance, and that&rsquo;s available on our website<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So having covered the specific new information in relation to AGMs, I would like to spend the remaining time I&rsquo;ve been given to speak with you outlining principles or goals that underlie a lot of the other requirements &ndash; one being information about the meeting and the second being access. The third thing I&rsquo;d like to finish on is how these things that already exist in the framework can be supplemented by best practice guidance, whether it be developed by industry or otherwise.</p>
<h2>Clear information about the meeting  &nbsp;</h2>
<p>The first clear purpose that underlies a lot of the provisions is around investors getting information about the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know, listed entities in Australia are required to provide members with a minimum 28 days of notice prior to a meeting.&nbsp; These notices must include the date, time, and details of the meeting format, as well as any planned business, information about any proposed special resolutions and proxy votes, and an email contact.&nbsp;So these are the core requirements and I think companies have an opportunity to think about how they provide and present information to assist investors make decisions. This will help meet the requirement for the notice to be clear, concise and effective.&nbsp;I mean, we&rsquo;ve all received unclear instructions on an important invitation to various things and [understand] the value of them being clarified or as clear as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it also comes back to that objective of confident and informed participation that I spoke of earlier and that fundamental right of the shareholder to be heard. If the medium is the message, logistics really matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, certain notices of meetings &ndash; or NOMs &ndash; are required to be lodged with ASIC prior to dispatch to members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently examined a sample of the NOMs lodged with us, in addition to those publicly available on the ASX Market Announcements Platform.&nbsp;We found that some of the entities that held virtual-only meetings during our review period may not have had constitutions that expressly permitted meetings to be held in that format.&nbsp;Or if they did, they didn&rsquo;t notify us as required. So, we&rsquo;ve taken the steps of writing to those companies just to make sure that these rules that apply to when you can have a virtual-only meeting are complied with in our system.</p>
<p>We have also received a small number of reports of misconduct from the public<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp;relating to insufficient notice periods being provided to shareholders prior to meetings, or meetings being switched from hybrid to virtual-only at short notice, including in circumstances where it wasn&rsquo;t provided for in the constitution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these reports are few in number and have not suggested widespread issues to date, I would like to remind you that ASIC is monitoring these reports and NOMs and expects compliance, as a fundamental part of enabling shareholder participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meetings are accessible&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The second key goal underlying a lot of these provisions is accessibility.&nbsp;This should not be misinterpreted as meaning that meetings are required to be in a certain format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s approach here is technology-neutral, as it is with many areas that we regulate.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t have a preference as to what format your meeting is in, as long as it meets three criteria: it is allowed by your constitution, it is properly disclosed, and it provides your shareholders with an opportunity to be heard and participate.&nbsp;After that, there&rsquo;s flexibility there.</p>
<p>Because participation is the cornerstone of corporate accountability. It is what makes the AGM a key accountability mechanism.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just an obligation, the AGM. It&rsquo;s an opportunity as well.&nbsp;Shareholders are not just there to listen but to be listened to. Some of the questions can really assist from both a corporate governance and reputational standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all seen the recent ComputerShare and Georgeson AGM Intelligence report<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/meeting-expectations/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>. It was an interesting characterisation that the remuneration vote is no longer just about remuneration, it is an annual referendum on company sentiment. That&rsquo;s how they characterised it and that&rsquo;s an interesting way of thinking about it.&nbsp;I think you&rsquo;ve got some discussions coming up about two strikes so I won&rsquo;t pre-empt those but I understand that&rsquo;s an important part of the meeting as well.</p>
<h2>Industry development of best practice guidelines&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So we can look at the statutory provisions &ndash; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re really clearly focused on &ndash; but the recommendation earlier from the Statutory Review did acknowledge that best practice guidelines can be developed by industry in a way that is really valuable and supplements anything done by the regulator or indeed in the statutory provisions themselves.</p>
<p>Today is a good example, talking about it and discussing options, ideas, and developments, in a way that is helpful for other colleagues in other companies. I wanted to also shout out that the idea of developing best practice guidelines was explicitly described in the Statutory Review as being really valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value of something in that format is that it is written, developed, and informed by the experts &ndash; that&rsquo;s you, in relation to what you see in practices with some of the more difficult issues.</p>
<p>Now I recognise that some parts of the Act are tricky &ndash; like &ldquo;reasonable participation&rdquo;. What does that mean if the technology goes down and people get disconnected from your meeting? How long do you have to wait for them to come back in or if they can&rsquo;t come back in? What do they do?</p>
<p>A statutory provision on reasonableness is never going to be able to give you all of the answers and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want it to. The idea of that level of granularity ends up in what I was talking about earlier &ndash; incredibly complex legislative frameworks that get stale or otherwise. So I would encourage you to think through the benefits of that as supplements to what I&rsquo;ve been talking about. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion &nbsp;</h2>
<p>So, to conclude I just wanted to finish on the concept of trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the requirements we&rsquo;ve spoken about today are relatively new for you but they&rsquo;re also new for your shareholders. Engaging with some of the changes in technology and formats does require a certain leap of faith on their part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that many retail shareholders have been attending your meetings since everything was done by post, so a lot has changed in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We saw concerns raised through the Statutory Review process that certain stakeholders distrusted virtual-only meetings if they felt it would be denying them their ability to fully exercise their rights and hold the board and management to account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My observation on that would be that best practice does breed confidence and breed trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if the medium is the message, there is great value in showing, as well as telling, your shareholders that their rights will be upheld, or even enhanced, regardless of what that format is for your meetings. Because that&rsquo;s what generates trust and that&rsquo;s a price we think is worth paying when it comes to good corporate governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again to AIRA and to everybody here. I&rsquo;m ready to answer questions.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) announced today that Timothy Hodgson has stepped down as Chair of the Board to pursue elected office, effective immediately. Miranda Hubbs, Chair of the Governance Committee and independent member of the Board, will serve as Interim Chair in accordance with the organization&rsquo;s governance framework.</p>
<p>Hodgson has served as CIRO&rsquo;s inaugural Chair since January 1, 2023, successfully guiding it through significant evolution and growth during its formative years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of CIRO, we thank Tim for his vision, steadfast guidance, and unwavering dedication. Through his exceptional leadership, the organization has achieved remarkable success in a relatively short period, enhancing the legacy of its predecessors to become an even stronger and more efficient regulator for Canada's financial markets&rdquo; said Hubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim has played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of CIRO, and we are grateful for his strategic insight and leadership,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler, Chief Executive Officer of CIRO. &ldquo;As the Board moves forward with identifying a new Chair, we remain focused on delivering our public interest mandate and continuing the important work already underway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Board of Directors will immediately commence a search for a permanent successor, a process that will be led by an independent director on behalf of the Governance Committee.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Over the last quarter of a century, the payments landscape has changed significantly, playing a crucial role in enabling commerce, supporting financial inclusion, and driving economic growth. To meet society's evolving needs, it is imperative we innovate to enhance our payment systems. Our core infrastructure must keep pace with new demands, meet modern requirements, and remain resilient against evolving threats. Payments are central to many fintech developments, with technologies such as blockchain, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, tokenisation, and atomic settlement enabling transformation. When delivered safely, innovation in both legacy systems and new platforms offers opportunities to create tangible impacts for end-users, enhancing ease of use, expanding consumer choice, and making payments quicker and more efficient domestically and cross border. Given the crucial role of payments in the modern economy, these enhancements can reduce transactional frictions and directly contribute to economic growth.</p>
<h3>Our role in payment innovation</h3>
<p>The Bank of England wears multiple hats in shaping the payments landscape: operator, supervisor, policy maker, and innovator. Our focus is on financial and monetary stability. And within that context we have a role in supporting and encouraging competition and innovation in payments. Our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/digital-pound-progress-update">'Digital money</a>' and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/dp/the-boes-approach-to-innovation-in-money-and-payments#:~:text=A%20digital%20pound%20could%20help,efficiency%20and%20choice%20in%20payments.#:~:text=A%20digital%20pound%20could%20help,efficiency%20and%20choice%20in%20payments.">'Approach to innovation in money and payments</a>' discussion papers highlight our wide interests in this area and underpin the importance of central bank money.</p>
<p>I lead the area of the Bank of England that operates our Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service and CHAPS, the UK&rsquo;s high value payment system. We play a pivotal role in supporting and encouraging innovation in payments. Our goal is to ensure that innovation develops in a way that supports continued resilience and broader financial stability. And we are continually exploring how our core infrastructure can enable and facilitate innovative new players that want to settle in central bank money and bring benefits to end-users.</p>
<p>An important step is our multi-year transformation programme to renew this core infrastructure. We have been working closely with industry to design a renewed RTGS service that will provide a more resilient, flexible, scalable infrastructure, and an open platform to help drive innovation across the financial sector. It has resilience at its core. But crucially it will also enable the development of new financial products and services, enhance operational efficiency, and support the evolving needs of the payments industry.</p>
<p>The first step in this journey was moving CHAPS to the ISO 20022 global messaging standard in 2023. Next is the new core ledger and settlement engine, which will provide increased resilience, capacity and a platform for further enhancements. In addition to creating a modern platform we want to enable more users to access it and to reap the benefits.</p>
<h3>Expanding access to RTGS</h3>
<p>In 2024, we published a discussion paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/dp/reviewing-access-to-rtgs-accounts-for-settlement">reviewing access to RTGS accounts for settlement</a>&nbsp;seeking views on our policies for access to settlement in RTGS.</p>
<p>Expanding access to RTGS is a key enabler for promoting innovation and resilience in the payments landscape. By enabling more, and a broader range of, institutions to access RTGS, we can enhance competition, leading to more innovative payment solutions and improved services for end-users. As new players bring fresh ideas and solutions to the market it should help to drive efficiency and reduce costs. Expanding access to RTGS services globally is one of the key building blocks of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">G20 roadmap to enhance cross-border payments</a>. It is an important step towards creating a more efficient and interconnected global payments system: and the more countries that expand access the greater the benefits.</p>
<p>The inclusion of non-bank payment service providers (NBPSPs) and other types of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) in our RTGS services is a significant, which demonstrates us leading the way in innovative payment solutions catering to the evolving needs of consumers and businesses. In 2017, we became the first G7 central bank to offer settlement accounts to NBPSPs. And since 2021 we have offered Omnibus Accounts to regulated payment system operators allowing them to pool participant funds in RTGS to back transactions in their own system and operate even when RTGS is closed.</p>
<p>Expanding access to RTGS also enhances the resilience of the payments system. By diversifying the number and range of institutions that can access central bank money settlement, we reduce tiering and concentration in the payments ecosystem. This in turn can increase the overall stability of the financial system.</p>
<p>Reflecting on feedback from our February 2024 discussion paper (DP) on reviewing access, we have continued to enhance access to RTGS. Before Easter we will publish a summary of the key feedback received, an update on work so far and our forward-looking policy work. In our DP we asked questions about enhancing access to RTGS. Today, I would like to provide a preview of our progress on each of four priority areas flagged in the DP. These changes are accompanied by tangible developments in the renewed RTGS to increase capacity for and the ease of onboarding new participants.</p>
<h4>Enhancing the Bank/Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) process for consideration of NBPSPs seeking access to RTGS</h4>
<p>As set out in our DP, we cooperate closely with the FCA to assess applications from NBPSPs to open an RTGS settlement account. To enhance the assessment process, the Bank and the FCA have made&nbsp;<strong>three changes to the cooperation framework</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>requiring a firm to undertake regulated activities for at least nine months before a full assessment, recognising that very newly authorised firms are unlikely to have gathered necessary evidence to achieve a positive outcome from the supervisory assessment process;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>undertaking a s166 assessment prior to the FCA providing an objection or<br />non-objection<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/victoria-cleland-speech-at-pay360#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;and;</li>
<li>setting an expectation that fast-growing firms will be subject to enhanced supervision when granted RTGS access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>These improvements are intended to provide a more focused and efficient process by ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements from the outset, helping to identify key risks at an earlier stage and enabling smoother on-boarding processes and management, especially during periods of growth. By streamlining these processes, we can support institutions in scaling their operations effectively and sustainably.</p>
<p>To enhance clarity, we are about to publish&nbsp;<strong>an updated version of a guide for NBPSP access to UK payment systems</strong>. This provides comprehensive information on how NBPSPs can access UK payment systems, outlining the requirements and processes involved.</p>
<h4>Understanding demand of foreign banks for access to RTGS to support payment system settlement</h4>
<p>We already provide RTGS access to foreign banks (i.e. UK subsidiaries or branches of banks incorporated outside the UK). Responses to our DP did not highlight the need for policy changes but did suggest more clarity is needed on the costs, benefits, and process for accessing RTGS directly. The content on the Bank&rsquo;s website will be updated shortly to make information about access to RTGS easier to navigate for industry stakeholders, including foreign banks. It will provide key information and include more detail on the benefits, costs, and processes involved. This aims to raise awareness among foreign banks and encourage their participation in the UK payments system.</p>
<h4>Clarifying requirements for FMIs</h4>
<p>We have published a&nbsp;<strong>revised access policy</strong>&nbsp;that introduces a live-proving and mobilisation stage for new and small FMIs allowing firms seeking access to RTGS, to test their access to RTGS and grow their business in a controlled way subject to restrictions to mitigate risk. This approach supports innovation and competition, while maintaining equivalent protection against risks to our objectives. It ensures that new services have been rigorously tested and sufficient controls are in place. The revised policy articulates the services we offer, how to access them, why we offer them, and how they work. We have also published new &ldquo;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/payments/rtgsrules.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RTGS rules</a>&rdquo; setting out our expectations for RTGS participants, including FMIs, in simple language.</p>
<h4>CHAPS value threshold</h4>
<p>The degree of tiering in a payment system may impact the smooth functioning of the payment system and of financial markets by increasing risk between the direct and the indirect participants. Reducing tiering in CHAPS participation could therefore mitigate financial stability risks by decreasing concentration, operational and credit risks in CHAPS.</p>
<p>This year we will further engage with industry to better understand the benefits and costs to, and assess any financial stability implications of further policy intervention to revise the CHAPS direct participation threshold, the level of CHAPS activity at which we have a presumption, absence mitigating factors, that an indirect participant should move to direct access. The phased approach and lessons from industry engagement will inform our further work in this area.</p>
<h4>Further access enhancements</h4>
<p>In light of the potential benefits of offering safeguarding facilities directly to NBPSPs, we are exploring whether and on what terms we could provide these facilities. These accounts with safeguarding functionality could provide NBPSPs with a secure means of holding funds overnight, enhancing their ability to manage liquidity and meet their payment obligations. This initiative would aim to make direct access to RTGS for NBPSPs more attractive, further levelling the payments playing field between bank and non-bank payment service providers while also reducing risk. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and competitive payments landscape, improving the end-user experience.</p>
<p>We are also supporting efforts to reform the regulatory regime for NBPSPs to identify opportunities to enhance their access to RTGS as well as mitigate risks they could pose to financial stability. This includes working with HMT and FCA to identify and address any barriers to access and developing policies that support the participation of NBPSPs in the payments system.</p>
<p>I encourage you to review our upcoming response and participate in our engagement, creating the next chapter in the evolution of access to RTGS.</p>
<h3>ISO 20022</h3>
<p>The ISO 20022 global messaging standard is another exciting key area which can bring benefits to the payments industry and to end users.</p>
<p>The adoption of the ISO 20022 global messaging standard marks a significant milestone in enhancing the quality of payment information. This standard provides a structured and data-rich common language that enhances the interoperability of financial messages across different systems and networks. The benefits of richer ISO 20022 data are wide ranging and include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced data richness:</strong>&nbsp;ISO 20022 enables the inclusion of more detailed information in payment messages, which can improve transparency and provide valuable insights for financial institutions and end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Improved efficiency:</strong>&nbsp;By supporting real-time payment processing and reducing the need for manual intervention, ISO 20022 facilitates straight-through processing, which enhances the overall efficiency of financial transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Better customer experience:</strong>&nbsp;The richness of data and improved processing capabilities can lead to a more seamless and satisfying experience for customers, with faster and more accurate payments.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced analytics:</strong>&nbsp;The structured data provided by ISO 20022 allows for better analytics and reporting, which can help financial institutions make more informed decisions and improve their services.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud prevention and compliance:</strong>&nbsp;Standardised information about the purpose of payments and the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) can aid in fraud prevention, sanctions screening, and compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me try to bring it to life with a couple of potential use cases for ISO 20022 data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reference information</strong>: Historically, retail payments have been limited by outdated communication standards, allowing only a small free text field for payment instructions. In the future, when you pay your hotel bill for a work trip, the payment could seamlessly link with the hotel's internal processes, including its address in a structured format and referencing the relevant invoice. If it is your employer picking up the tab, the purpose of your visit could be instantly populated into your employer's systems, including relevant tax information ready for your employer to share with UK tax authorities. Additionally, your employer could confirm your identity within the payment, allowing the hotel to cross-check your identity upon arrival, mitigating the risk of mistaken identity.</li>
<li><strong>Payment prioritisation</strong>: We are establishing a framework to prioritise property transactions and Financial Institution to Financial Institution (FI-to-FI) payments for the rollout of richer ISO 20022 enhanced data in CHAPS. A rich, high-quality<br />real-time source of payment purpose data will boost the resilience of the CHAPS ecosystem. Banks could use these to prioritise certain CHAPS payments during outages, such as house completions where the real economy impact of disruption could be the most severe.</li>
</ul>
<p>To unlock these benefits, and more, it is vital that the entire industry works together. Collaboration across market infrastructures, financial institutions, and technology providers is essential to fully realise the potential of ISO 20022. For instance, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and Payment Market Practice Group (PMPG)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p230223.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint task force on harmonising the use of ISO 20022 messaging in cross-border payments</a>&nbsp;has brought together public and private sector expertise to ensure a harmonised global adoption of the richer ISO 20022 data to address payment system misalignment and work towards a shared vision for the future of payment data.</p>
<p>To promote the use of enhanced data within the UK payments sector, we will mandate the use of ISO 20022 enhanced data for certain CHAPS payments from 1 May 2025. This includes purpose codes for payments between financial institutions and property transactions, as well as the inclusion of LEIs for payments between financial institutions. Consistent and wide usage of the LEI has numerous potential benefits, including supporting improved resolution planning, increased financial crime detection and customer due diligence, and innovation in products and services. In the build up to the 1 May deadline, we are already seeing an increase in the usage of enhanced data within CHAPS payment messages, with an 80% increase in messages containing an LEI or Purpose Code over the last six months.</p>
<p>The industry's role in implementing ISO 20022 is crucial. Financial institutions need to integrate enhanced data into their systems and processes, and actively encourage their customers to do the same. By using the data, financial institutions can drive efficiency, improve customer experiences, and enhance the overall resilience and transparency of the financial system. It is through collective effort and collaboration that we can achieve the full benefits of ISO 20022 and pave the way for a more efficient and secure payments landscape.</p>
<p>The adoption of ISO 20022 can also drive innovation by enabling the development of new payment products and services. The rich data can be used to create more personalised and targeted financial products, enhancing the customer experience and driving growth in the payments industry. Innovation enabled by an abundance of richer data in areas, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning is globally at the forefront of technological progress. In the payments sector, the enhanced data opportunities of the ISO 20022 messaging standard provide a golden opportunity for the sector to leverage this incredibly valuable data resource to deliver more efficient and effective payment solutions for all payment users.</p>
<h3>Innovation and experimentation</h3>
<p>As part of the Bank&rsquo;s future roadmap for RTGS, we are driving strategic changes that enhance system resiliency and support industry innovation. We are, for example, exploring tokenisation, and the role it could play in enhancing transactions in wholesale markets. It could enable greater efficiency in transactions and post-trade processes, as well as enabling new functionality such as smart contracts. This technology is increasingly being adopted by industry and we are considering it through the lens of benefits and risks.</p>
<p>A current priority is developing our synchronisation capability to seamlessly connect RTGS with diverse ledgers, both domestically and internationally, through dedicated synchronisation operators. This advancement has the potential to significantly reduce settlement risks and liquidity costs, ensuring transactions are executed with certainty and efficiency.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk193706567"></a>In order to assess such innovations, we have been working internally and with partners to undertake various experiments, focusing on addressing real-world challenges. Project Meridian, conducted with the BIS Innovation Hub&rsquo;s London centre in 2023, demonstrated synchronised settlement between an RTGS system and a digital asset ledger in a UK housing context, yielding valuable insights. It showcased how synchronisation could be applied to house purchases using a digital housing deed.</p>
<p>Building on that success, Meridian FX is now exploring multi-currency settlement, showcasing the adaptability of synchronisation across various asset classes and technologies. Currently, we are working with the Eurosystem to explore the synchronisation of foreign exchange between sterling and euro. This involves connecting to the three solutions being explored as part of the Eurosystem&rsquo;s work on wholesale settlement, including linking an RTGS system with a DLT-based settlement system. This exploration aims to enable interoperability between existing and new technologies, potentially benefiting cross-border payments with lower liquidity costs and reduced settlement risk. We look forward to reporting our findings in collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub in the near future.</p>
<p>In order to help inform future policy and design choices, we will undertake further use experiments to achieve insights, enhance our understanding and gain empirical evidence on the role that new technologies can play. In July, we set out our ambition to launch a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/dp/the-boes-approach-to-innovation-in-money-and-payments">programme of wholesale experiments</a>. These experiments will explore the use cases, functionalities, and prospective designs of wholesale CBDC and synchronisation, and their relative merits. This is an exciting programme of work, which will benefit from strong collaboration with industry: we will provide an update soon.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The payments landscape is evolving rapidly, and the Bank of England is at the forefront of this transformation. As providers of core infrastructure, regulators, policymakers, and innovators, we are dedicated to fostering a supportive environment for innovation while maintaining financial system resilience. Collaboration with all stakeholders across the payments ecosystem is an important ingredient of success.</p>
<p>By working together and embracing changes such as ISO 20022, access to RTGS and exploring new models such as synchronisation, we can create a payments landscape that enhances efficiency, security, and develops new products and services, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. Let us shape the future of payments and enable the benefits of innovation to be realised by all.</p>

<title>What’s Past Is Prologue : Finding Balance At The SEC Remarks At The Investment Company Institute’s 2025 Investment Management Conference, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, San Diego, CA, March 18, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Good morning and thank you for having me. Before I begin, I would like to thank ICI for the invitation to speak here today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I am coming to speak before you during a time of change, both at the agency and in the nation as a whole. During times of profound change like this, I think it is fitting to reflect upon the past. So today I will begin with a brief history of the Acts of 1940 &ndash; the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act &ndash; which serve as the foundation for much of the collective work that we do. Then I&rsquo;ll turn to some observations about the state of affairs as I see them today. And finally, I&rsquo;ll leave you with parting words about our path forward and take questions.</p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The &rsquo;40 Acts</span></span></p>
<p>Prior to the 1929 stock market crash, a budding asset management industry was taking shape &ndash; smaller investors were invited to pool their assets with the assets of others, mostly in closed-end funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;As former Commissioner Robert Healy observed, these funds were promoted as providing &ldquo;security for old age and for emergencies&rdquo; through &ldquo;expert management and diversification of risk&rdquo; &ndash; much as they are perceived by us today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;But, left unchecked, fund sponsors locked investors out of management and engaged in self-dealing and fraud with little transparency or recourse.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;As Paul Cabot, founder of State Street, observed prior to the crash in March 1929, two major abuses proliferated in the industry:&nbsp;<i>first</i>, companies operated out of self-interest rather than shareholder-interest; and&nbsp;<i>second</i>, investment companies were used as repositories for otherwise unmarketable securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Following the 1929 crash, Congress mandated that the Commission promulgate a study of investment trusts and investment companies. The Commission&rsquo;s study confirmed these ills, describing practices relating to, not only &ldquo;outright embezzlement,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;to the unloading of worthless securities and other investments of doubtful value upon the [investment] companies; to loans which investment companies have been caused to make to insiders; to the bail-outs of insiders from dubious and illiquid investments.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>But, from these pernicious practices, legislation that governs much of our work today was born: the Investment Advisors Act and the Investment Company Act, both passed in 1940. Stemming from the foundation laid out in the Commission&rsquo;s study &ndash; these Acts were the product of cooperation between industry participants and the Commission in furtherance of a shared goal of building robust markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, the 1940 Acts largely had the support of industry leaders, many of whom urged for their passage because they understood that building successful markets would require eradicating harmful practices and rebuilding investor trust. The overall collaboration and mutual support for the legislation were heralded as nothing short of miraculous, and the 1940 Acts passed unanimously in Congress.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Upon signing the legislation into law, President Roosevelt observed that it was his &ldquo;Administration&rsquo;s purpose to aid the honest businessman and to assist him in bringing higher standards to his particular corner of the business community.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>And that is where our journey began. The Investment Company Act serves as a basis for full and fair disclosure to fund investors, and comprehensively regulates investment companies through prescribed governance mechanisms, reflective of the characteristics of the fund. For example, it prescribes requirements relating to valuations, redemptions, service provider relationships, and limitations on leverage, and imposes restrictions on affiliate transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;These and many other requirements aim at safeguarding assets of investors as they seek to diversify their savings. The Investment Advisers Act is more principles-based and imposes on advisers a heightened obligation to serve investors with loyalty and care.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Importantly, these requirements aim to decrease the incidence of the abusive practices that led to the passage of the Acts.</p>
<p>These seminal laws have served as the foundation for a fund industry that people trust. The numbers bear that out. In 1940, when the Acts became law, registered management investment companies held slightly more than $1 billion in assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Now, there are over 16,000 U.S. registered investment companies with nearly $34 trillion in total net assets, largely invested on behalf of more than 120 million U.S. retail investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;More than 71.5 million U.S. households own U.S. registered funds &ndash; which is more than half of all U.S. households.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Current Environment</span></span></p>
<p>Against this historical backdrop, there are a few things that that we should all keep in mind in the current climate.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, democratic institutions matter. The&nbsp;<i>Securities and Exchange Commission</i>&nbsp;as an institution matters. When Roosevelt signed the 1940 Acts into law, he noted the industry&rsquo;s recognition of the importance of the agency:</p>
<p>[I]t deserves notice that the investment trust industry insisted that the Congress grant to the Securities and Exchange Commission broader discretionary powers than those contemplated in the original regulatory proposal. Not only is this a tribute to the personnel of the SEC and an endorsement of its wisdom and essential fairness in handling financial problems, but it serves well to indicate that many businessmen now realize that efficient regulation in technical fields such as this requires an administering agency which has been given flexible powers to meet whatever problems may arise.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>We find ourselves in a unique moment in history where our executive agencies and departments are being . . . reconceived and, in some cases, potentially dismantled. Unequivocally, we are seeing transformation.</p>
<p>But, what the Commission does &ndash; in concert with investment companies that you all represent &ndash; is nothing short of enabling the American Dream. We write rules that allow your investment products to go to market, so that millions of our neighbors and community members can save for retirement, building their 401(k) and IRA accounts with transparent products appropriate for their risk tolerances and goals. Our rules reduce the cost of capital, lead to higher quality disclosures, and build investor confidence.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Markets are built on trust. I cannot emphasize that enough. That trust comes when industry and regulators work together to make and live in a system that is fair, transparent, and that holds participants accountable for misdeeds that harm investors and the markets alike. That&rsquo;s what started in 1940. And we need a strong Commission to continue to carry out this mission.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, I have seen trends that undermine the strength of the agency and the markets. There is of course the constant job insecurity felt by the staff that you have been reading about in the newspapers. There have been prominent critiques of staff for doing their jobs &ndash; tasks which were performed in line with directives given by presidentially-appointed commissioners. And, we have seen instances of lawyers and issuers effectively disregarding the comments and concerns of staff before going live with their investment products.</p>
<p>Such behavior is harmful. It may be expedient, or even business-enhancing in the short term, but it is anathema to our democratic institutions and the markets in the long run. We must forge a path forward together.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>And lest we forget, our institution is currently strong and flexible in the manner conceived by Roosevelt. We are an agency that listens to the industry and the investors that we oversee and serve. Over the last four years, we saw an ambitious agenda that attempted to address issues in the asset management industry such as shareholder dilution, custody, and digital engagement practices. We made proposals and opened (and sometimes reopened) notice and comment periods, and took many meetings with stakeholders. We listened. I listened. For example, many of you in this room sat down with me and discussed the operational and fairness concerns raised by our proposal relating to swing pricing and the hard close. These types of discussions matter.</p>
<p>This leads into my&nbsp;<i>second</i>&nbsp;point. Mistakes get made when we move too quickly. Agency deliberation should be thoughtful, measured and data driven. The rulemaking process may be cumbersome, but the results benefit from the input of industry participants, investors, advocates, lawmakers, and experts.</p>
<p>What we are seeing right now at the agency, I fear, is a sort of &ldquo;deregulation by guidance.&rdquo; Over the past weeks we have, without Commission vote, notice or comment, or (I would argue) due economic consideration to the costs and benefits: changed the guidelines concerning engagement with management for purposes of Schedules 13D and 13G;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;refashioned verification requirements for accredited investors;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;changed the rules of the road for proxy proposals in the middle of proxy season;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;and, issued a blanket opinion &ndash; without due consideration of facts and circumstances &ndash; that a famously volatile class of tokens were not securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Just to name a few.</p>
<p>Many of us in this room have had discussions about the cumulative impact that our proposed rulemakings may have on market participants. But here, I wonder what will be the cumulative impact on investors and the markets for rushed policy changes, not subject to APA rigors or Commission-level deliberations?</p>
<p><i>Finally</i>, one last trend that I&rsquo;ll mention &ndash; intertwined with the more broadly deregulatory posture is a rush to expose retail investors to riskier or less liquid markets through an ETF wrapper. I here too would urge caution and deliberation as we take products that retail investors traditionally view as plain vanilla and materially change the risk profile &ndash; especially where the products typically go automatically effective and don&rsquo;t receive the benefit of Commission-level approval. Perhaps not everything is an ETF.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-investment-company-institute-031825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></span></p>
<p>There are lessons to be applied today from the foundational work that went into the two Acts of 1940. There was a partnership and an alliance that formed around the passage of those Acts that should be valued. A strong and flexible regulator can work with industry to create market strength and trust. But that trust is maintained by sound deliberation on both the part of the regulator and the industry that it regulates. Too easily it can be eroded or eliminated, potentially leading to an unfortunate cycle of de-regulation and re-regulation. When we move too quickly, the pendulum tends to swing back. I hope we keep the lessons of the past in our minds as we rush toward the future.</p>

The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a strong monthly increase in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 8,103 in February, which is up 79.9% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, North American corporate requests were down 7.1% over February 2024 totals. The monthly increase was driven by a 112.8% rise in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers, along with increases in request volume for short-term certificates of deposit (61.6%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (19.5%).</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 36.4% versus January totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 17.1%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 118 new CUSIP requests in February, followed by New York (73) and California (65).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporate and municipal CUSIP requests rebounded in February after declines in January to start the year,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;It will be interesting to see if the turnaround in higher request volume will be sustained amid market and economic uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 29.2% in February and international debt CUSIP requests rose 26.2%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 20.1% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 48.7%.</p>

This will enable companies to distribute data within a 0.5 nanosecond (ns) one-way latency compared to the 4-5ns with commonly used Layer 1 devices.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, firms have to take fiber from the exchange, use a modular interface which supports connections (SFP module), and then plug it into a Layer 1 switch to distribute data to other devices. A typical Layer 1 switch adds 4-5ns of one-way latency. With VeloCT, Layer 1 switches can be replaced in extremely latency-sensitive environments, enabling companies to create multiple copies of the data with latency comparable to a single SFP module of 0.5ns one-way. Its highly specialized copper-based twinax cables also reduce latency compared to conventional copper by 0.6ns per meter of cable one-way, more if converting from fiber.</span></p>
<p><span>LDA&rsquo;s new ecosystem includes a variety of fan-out modules that can be interchangeably connected to a rackable device, special ultra-low latency cables and accompanying accessories. It provides a flexible and easy-to-manage connection for network devices, reducing hardware costs while slashing latency.</span></p>
<p><span>Vahan Sardaryan, CEO of LDA, said: &ldquo;There has been an ongoing discussion for a number of years in low latency trading about where the next latency reductions can be found. As we approach the speed of light, further significant reductions seem almost out of reach. However, with VeloCT, we&rsquo;ve found a way to reduce trade roundtrip latency by a very significant margin, especially important for High Frequency Trading (HFT). This gives our clients a major competitive advantage: after all, replacing Layer 1 switches to slash data distribution latency by up to 10x is a very significant improvement. While other firms are looking to improve by picoseconds, we have taken a completely unique approach to the challenge and have redefined what it means to be fast.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The VeloCT modules also create a duplicate of the outgoing data stream, eliminating the need for standalone tap devices and enabling firms to seamlessly monitor, capture and analyze every data packet with unparalleled accuracy and speed.</span></p>
<p><span>VeloCT is delivered in a chassis that can accommodate up to 22 modules. It is a comprehensive, versatile ecosystem comprising ultra-small form-factor 1-to-4 and 1-to-8 link splitters, specialized high-speed twinax cables with lower latency than standard copper and modular transceivers (SFP, QSFP and QSFP-DD) to seamlessly deliver data to the servers, FPGAs and switches that drive trading infrastructure.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Ramiro, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with all of you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250325a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Welcome to Washington, D.C.! Bienvenidos a la capital! I hope you have a productive conference and an enjoyable visit. I am honored to speak with you today because I have long appreciated the efforts of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in supporting Hispanic-owned businesses, especially small businesses and entrepreneurs. It is also gratifying to speak to you today as the first Latin policymaker in the Federal Reserve's history.</p>
<p>The support and mentorship from my family and my communities, including many in the Hispanic community, have been foundational to my career. I am proud that I can bring my own perspective and background to how I view the economy and economic data&mdash;just as I value learning and hearing from others&mdash;because I know the decisions I make can affect the lives of all Americans. As a Fed Governor, I serve all Americans, and I strive to recognize the economic contributions that come from all corners of this country.</p>
<p>Today, I will talk about the entrepreneurial spirit that many Latinos embody and share with you the importance of Latinos to the whole of the U.S. economy. I will then provide my outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurial Spirit</strong><br />Let me start by saying that I have a strong affinity for entrepreneurs and recognize that they are a driving force behind economic growth and job creation&mdash;which I know from the data, as I have spent most of my career as a labor economist and researcher. But I truly understand the crucial role they play in the economy because my grandparents and father were entrepreneurs. My maternal grandfather was a dairy farmer, and I still recall the effort and dedication I saw as a child while joining him as he went from store to store selling milk early in the morning&mdash;before starting his other job as mayor of the town. And my paternal grandparents owned an electronics shop, where they worked shoulder to shoulder. My grandpa ran the front end of the shop, and my grandma was in charge of the accounting and inventory. The lessons on the value of hard work and taking initiative have stayed with me throughout my career in academia and continue to now in my work as a policymaker. I have always brought an entrepreneurial spirit to everything I do, seeking to be proactive about identifying opportunities and pursuing new or better solutions to long-standing challenges.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what millions of Latino entrepreneurs do across the U.S. every day. There are roughly 5 million Latino-owned businesses that provide jobs to millions of other workers across the country.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250325a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;And the number of entrepreneurs is growing fast. Between 2007 and 2022, there was a 57 percent increase in the number of Latin-owned businesses, and the number of employees on their collective payrolls grew 1.2 million. As I have emphasized in my past speeches, the growth in new business formation has been critical in sustaining the productivity growth that we have experienced in recent years, which has allowed us to achieve an economic expansion while reducing inflation.</p>
<p>I see this growth as I travel around the country and meet with workers and business leaders. For example, I noted in a recent speech in Miami that South Florida is an area with a large and vibrant Latino community and is also one of the top regions for new business formation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250325a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Other data are also consistent with an elevated level of entrepreneurship in our community. Latino adults who did not previously own a business created a new company at nearly twice the national rate in 2023.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250325a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;And while the overall new entrepreneurship rate edged lower after a pandemic-era jump, the rate for Latino entrepreneurs continued to rise to a new record high in 2023. This growth matters to the U.S. economy. Entrepreneurs improve the way of doing business and generate new jobs and wealth. They often create new processes, products, markets, and services that solve problems and improve the quality of life for many. Entrepreneurs also bring fresh perspectives and contribute to economic progress. For example, a recent survey by the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative shows that Latino-owned businesses outperform others in the adoption of artificial intelligence.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250325a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p><strong>Latinos in the Economy</strong><br />Beyond starting businesses and creating jobs, Latinos are a large and growing part of the economy&mdash;as consumers, workers, and investors. Collectively, Latino households generate trillions of dollars in economic activity each year in the U.S. There are 34 million Latino workers in the U.S. labor force, and the median weekly earnings of Latinos working full time has doubled over the past 20 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those data points suggest that many Latino workers are moving into higher-wage, higher-productivity jobs. Overall, nearly one in every five Americans are of Latino heritage. In some states, such as Texas, that figure is closer to two in five. And given that the Latino population is growing, it is not surprising that Texas also led the country in job creation last year, adding 284,000 jobs to payrolls.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250325a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Across the U.S., the Latino labor force has grown 14 percent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, much faster than the about 4 percent growth for the total labor force.</p>
<p>Latinos tend to work or seek employment at high rates. The Latino labor force participation rate was 66.9 percent in February versus 62.4 percent for the population overall. In addition to filling jobs for employers and meeting consumer demand for goods and services, this labor force growth was a helpful counter to inflation at a time when the labor market was historically tight.</p>
<p>The growth in the Latino workforce contributed to the rebalancing of the U.S. labor market in recent years. The labor market has cooled from an overheated state to a stable position characterized by low unemployment and diminished wage pressures. Latino workers especially aided that rebalancing by taking positions that had been difficult for employers to fill. For example, early in the pandemic many Americans remodeled or expanded their homes, where they were suddenly spending much more time. And anyone in this room that undertook such a project in 2021 or 2022 likely remembers how difficult it was to hire carpenters, plumbers, and other workers. Many skilled Latino workers filled that void. As of February, Latinos accounted for 35 percent of all construction workers, up from about 30 percent five years ago. Similarly, Latino workers have outsized representation in several other fields in which hiring has been challenging in recent years. Over one-third of warehouse and storage workers and one-fourth of couriers&mdash;both important to the e-commerce industry&mdash;are Latino. Latinos also represent a large share of critical childcare, automotive repair, and building maintenance positions&mdash;the people that make it possible for everyone to get to work and do their jobs well.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the young Latino population will continue to contribute to the labor force, as 1 million Latinos every year will turn 18 over the next two decades. And the educational attainment growth of Latinos is three times faster than that of other groups. Already one-fourth of the nation's K&ndash;12 students are Latino&mdash;thus on track to soon contribute to the skilled labor force.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />Of course, I am always studying how the economy is playing out for Americans of all backgrounds. As such, I would like to share with you my economic outlook before I conclude.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy has been on solid footing in recent years. Consistent with that assessment, real gross domestic product grew 2.5 percent last year. The most recent data on economic activity in the early part of this year have shown some signs of softness: Retail sales plunged more than 1 percent in January. However, that slowing was not entirely unexpected after the strong showing in December, some bad weather earlier this year, and the difficulties in the seasonal adjustment of the data. Moreover, growth in retail sales moved back up into positive territory, increasing 0.2 percent in February.</p>
<p>The labor market appears to be stable through February. U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs in February and 125,000 in January. The pace of hiring during the first two months of the year is a slowdown compared with the strong gains in November and December, but, again, that could reflect weather disruptions and seasonal adjustment challenges. Over the past six months, employers added a solid average of 190,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate&mdash;4.1 percent last month&mdash;is low and has remained near its current level since last summer.</p>
<p>Turning to inflation, I have been keenly aware that price increases have been painful for American families, and I have supported policies intended to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target. This effort has paid dividends. Inflation has come down a long way from its peak of more than 7 percent in June 2022. Based on the consumer price index and producer price index data for February, it is estimated that the 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was 2.5 percent last month. That is welcome progress, but that progress has slowed since last summer. In certain subcategories there is evidence that inflation reaccelerated in recent months. Importantly, while goods inflation was negative in 2024&mdash;as was the norm before the pandemic&mdash;it has turned positive in recent months. This development is unhelpful because goods inflation has often kept a lid on total inflation and also affects inflation expectations. In addition to the increase in prices already captured in official data, surveys show that consumers are expecting further increases in the near term. For instance, both short-run and long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have climbed in recent months. According to comments from survey respondents, much of this uncertainty appears to be tied to trade policy. I am paying close attention to the acceleration of price increases and higher inflation expectations, especially given the recent bout of inflation in the past few years. Given the economy's overall solid position and the heightened level of uncertainty, I supported the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision last week to maintain the policy rate at its current level. I see current policy as continuing to be restrictive and I judge that FOMC policy is well positioned. The committee can react to new developments by holding at the current rate for some time as we closely monitor incoming data and the cumulative effects of new policies. I remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal while maintaining a solid labor market. As always, I will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering the appropriate policy rate.</p>

<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced its Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) subsidiary has successfully launched its enhanced Agent Clearing Service, as well as new capabilities to separate house and customer activity and margin segregation for those customers who elect to post margin to FICC, ahead of the March 31, 2025, deadline from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>While the SEC extended the deadlines for mandatory clearing of covered U.S. Treasury cash activity and repo activity, FICC continues to see solid growth, both in the onboarding of buyside and sell side institutions and in increased volumes in its Government Securities Division (GSD) as firms seek the capital efficiency and liquidity benefits that central clearing provides. Prior to the SEC&rsquo;s proposed rule to expand central clearing of U.S. Treasury activity, FICC&rsquo;s volumes were approximately $4.5T daily. When the SEC&rsquo;s rule was finalized in December 2023, FICC&rsquo;s volumes were approximately $7.2T daily. Now, FICC is clearing over $9T as a daily average and has experienced multiple daily peaks above $10T, including at the end of February when volumes topped $10.4T.</p>
<p>Cleared buyside activity through FICC experienced an 85% year-over-year growth in FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service in February, and a peak Sponsored volume over $2T at year end 2024. Use of FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service provides the industry more than $700B each day in balance sheet capacity, and at the end of 2024, balance sheet savings across the industry through use of the Sponsored Service topped $900B.</p>
<p>Notably, FICC estimates that it is already clearing nearly half of the outstanding Treasury repo covered by the SEC&rsquo;s clearing requirement, with U.S. Money Market Funds already clearing approximately 46% of their covered U.S. Treasury repo activity through FICC today. FICC remains committed to delivering further enhancements to its Sponsored and Agent Clearing Services later in 2025 to further increase margin and capital efficiencies to attract the remainder of covered Treasury repo activity into central clearing at FICC.</p>
<p>FICC also continues to see its client base diversify and expand. Through its enhanced Agent Clearing Service, FICC is supporting over 1,500 Executing Firm customers, including regional broker-dealers, asset managers and Principal Trading Firms. Participation in FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service also continues to grow, with over 5,800 Sponsored Member relationships established to date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the additional time granted by the SEC on the expanded clearing deadlines, FICC remains firmly committed to supporting the cleared U.S. Treasury market as it continues to evolve and grow, including by collaborating with the industry to roll out enhancements to FICC&rsquo;s done-away capabilities for Treasury cash and repo activity,&rdquo; stated Laura Klimpel, Managing Director, Head of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. &ldquo;The significant growth in membership and volumes is a testament to the value of central clearing with FICC, and we expect this growth to continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To support growing volumes and membership, FICC remains laser-focused on delivering best-in-class risk management and transparency to the U.S. Treasury market, including through its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/february/24/cme-group-and-dtcc-to-enhance-existing-cross-margining-arrangement" target="_blank">enhanced cross-margining arrangement</a>, the introduction of a new client reporting portal, and via its publicly available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/november/13/dtccs-ficc-enhances-var-calculator-capabilities" target="_blank">VaR</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/june/12/dtcc-ficc-launches-cclf-public-calculator-to-support-expansion-of-us-treasury-clearing" target="_blank">CCLF</a>&nbsp;calculators which allow firms to assess, in real time, the margin and liquidity impact of centrally clearing their Treasury activity at FICC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robust risk management is a top priority for DTCC. With this launch, FICC also enhanced its intraday monitoring processes to measure exposure changes in 15-minute increments,&rdquo; stated Robert Crain, Managing Director, FICC Market Risk, &ldquo;These capabilities will further reduce risk for participants as well as improve the safety and soundness of the U.S. Treasury market.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Acuiti Avelacom 1Q25 Insights Report: Exodus Of European Proprietary Trading Firms Set To Accelerate Due To Regulatory Burdens</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acuiti-avelacom-1q25-insights-report-exodus-of-european-proprietary-trading-fir-2025325/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acuiti-avelacom-1q25-insights-report-exodus-of-european-proprietary-trading-fir-2025325/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The number of European proprietary trading firms relocating outside the continent is set to accelerate in the wake of unsustainable regulatory burdens, the latest Acuiti Proprietary Trading Management Insight Report has found.</span></p>
<p><span>The quarterly report, which was released today and is produced in partnership with Avelacom, is based on a survey of the Acuiti Proprietary Trading Expert Network, which comprises senior proprietary trading executives around the world. The report provides insights into the key trends facing the community.</span></p>
<p><span>This quarter&rsquo;s report found that 12% of European proprietary trading firms had decided to move outside the region and a further 36% were considering doing so. They will join the 8% that had already moved. Of those that had decided to move, Dubai is the main location to where firms were looking to relocate, followed by Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span>The decisions to relocate follow a substantial increase in regulatory burdens, with the Digital Operation Resilience Act (DORA), the final straw for many firms. All Mifid II regulated firms are now subject to DORA, which requires firms to put into place extensive frameworks for monitoring third-party vendor relationships.</span></p>
<p><span>The regulation comes on top of a punitive capital regime introduced in Europe for proprietary trading firms in the form of IFR/IFD, which entered into force in 2021 and is being implemented in phases.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The sheer number of proprietary trading firms looking to relocate outside Europe is a significant concern,&rdquo; says Ross Lancaster, head of research at Acuiti. &ldquo;The departures will inevitably reduce liquidity and lower the competitiveness of European capital markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Aleksey Larichev, CEO of Avelacom, says: &ldquo;We are responding to the latest trend of firms moving into new jurisdictions and expanding into highly volatile markets. Avelacom operates in more than 90 data centers across 25+ key global markets with 40 cloud on-ramps, providing the necessary IT infrastructure. Long-term scalability, flexibility, and continuous IT updates are key to maintaining competitiveness in the financial services sector.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Other key findings in this quarter&rsquo;s report include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>2024 was another strong year for proprietary trading firms as a volatile Q4 boosted annual revenues</span></li>
<li><span>30% of proprietary trading firms reported a significant increase in costs in 2024 with exchange fees and market data fees seeing the biggest increases</span></li>
<li><span>Just 27% of proprietary trading firms subject to DORA were fully compliant on the implementation date</span></li>
<li><span>44% of proprietary trading firms have deployed or are considering deploying back-ups in the event that the sabotage of under-sea cables impacts their ability to trade</span></li>
</ul>

<title>Report: Almost One-Third Of Firms Leveraging AI For Communications Surveillance In Reaction To Greater Regulatory Pressures - New Research From Global Relay Reveals That Reducing False Positives, Risk Identification And Voice Transcription Are The Top Three Use Cases For AI Implementation In Communications By The Financial Industry</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-almost-one-third-of-firms-leveraging-ai-for-communications-surveillance-2025325/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Relay</a>, the leading provider of electronic communication compliance and archiving solutions,&nbsp;released its State of AI in Surveillance Report 2025, discovering that 31% of industry respondents have already or intend to implement AI in surveillance processes in the next 12 months, as financial firms come under increased regulatory pressure. The report also revealed a 19% reduction in the number of firms reluctant to implement AI since June 2024, suggesting that attitudes to AI are changing for the positive.</p>
<p>The global survey examines how compliance, surveillance and risk leaders in financial services are integrating AI into compliance workflows, charting benefits, challenges and regulatory implications of using the technology. With over $8 billion in SEC fines levied last year for compliance failures, regulators are cracking down on outdated lexicon-based monitoring tools.</p>
<p>Lexicon-based approaches require surveillance teams to manually define all the keywords for which their system needs to watch. This means it is difficult to capture every term or phrase variation that personnel may use relating to high-risk areas &ndash; let alone identify misconduct attempts that don&rsquo;t fit into prescribed lexicon buckets. Implementing AI-enabled surveillance can reduce false positives (the top goal of 23% of respondents), improve risk identification (20%), execute voice transcription (14%) and more.</p>
<p>Donald McElligott, VP of Compliance Supervision, says: &ldquo;The whole world of surveillance has been about dealing with overwhelming volumes of false positives. Everything you did was eliciting 100 false positives for every one legitimate red flag to investigate. AI flips this over.&rdquo; He continues: &ldquo;The days of throwing people (and thus, salaries) at a big pile of data and sifting through to find a couple of needles in a haystack are gone. AI only identifies real risks, making compliance more efficient and precision-driven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The research found that data security remains the biggest barrier for firms adopting AI into surveillance workflows (25%), followed by budget (21%), explainability and transparency (17%) and pushback from internal teams (13%).</p>
<p>Rob Mason, Director of Regulatory Intelligence, comments:&nbsp;&ldquo;Explainability has long been a barrier to AI adoption &ndash; the fear that, in the event of regulatory investigations, firms using AI-driven processes will be unable to explain to the regulator how a decision was made. However, with AI outpacing lexicon-based approaches, it begs the question as to whether regulators should be considering how they can evaluate this new technology. The benefits are overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The research also indicates that 38% of respondents are watching how the industry develops to determine whether to use AI in surveillance processes, as regulators across jurisdictions have taken several different approaches to AI&rsquo;s adoption.</p>
<p>For more information on&nbsp;<i>State of AI in Surveillance Report 2025,&nbsp;</i>please see&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/guides-reports/global-relay-industry-insights-state-of-ai-in-surveillance-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<li><span>Support sustained economic growth</span>, by enabling investment, innovation and ensuring the continued competitiveness of the UK&rsquo;s world-leading financial services.</li>
<li><span>Help consumers navigate their financial lives</span>&nbsp;by working with industry to boost trust, product innovation and ensuring the right information and support is available for people to take financial decisions.</li>
<li><span>Fight financial crime</span>, focusing on those who seek to use the fact they are regulated to do harm. It will go further to disrupt criminals and support firms to be an effective line of defence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashley Alder, Chair of the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We want to deepen trust in financial services and shift our collective attitude across financial services to risk. Too often the focus has been on the risks of a decision taken rather than the lost opportunity of taking none. We want to change that so we can spur growth and improve lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive of the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Our last strategy set high standards and bolstered our operational effectiveness. We are committed to going much further, delivering at pace to meet the scale of change we are facing over the next 5 years. This strategy sets out our priorities, how we&rsquo;ll become more efficient and effective and make the choices that shape the financial system.</p>
<p>'Our 4 priorities reinforce one another and we look forward to collaborating with our partners as we become a smarter regulator, support growth, help consumers and fight crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are ambitious for the future and committed to enabling a fair and thriving financial services market for the good of consumers and the economy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The strategy sets out how the FCA will change how it supervises to be more efficient. This includes taking a less intensive approach for those firms seeking to do the right thing, significantly streamlining how it sets its supervisory priorities, and reviewing whether it can stop requiring certain data returns. It will also digitise and simplify the authorisation processes so it is easier and quicker to apply, the information received is better quality and follow-up requests are reduced.</p>
<p>The regulator also plans to invest in its technology, people and systems. It will support its people to build their digital capability and adopt new approaches to allow it to better handle the 100,000 cases it assesses every year. This will enable it to act faster and more assertively where harm is greatest.</p>
<p>As the FCA integrates the Payment Systems Regulator and many of its functions, it will build on the success of Open Banking and launch Open Finance. This will allow for more seamless data-sharing which could unlock product innovation and deliver lower costs, more choice and better information for consumers.</p>
<p>The new strategy builds on the FCA&rsquo;s achievements over the course of its previous 3-year strategy. These include making the biggest changes to the listing regime in over 3 decades so it&rsquo;s easier for companies to raise money, introducing the Consumer Duty to set higher standards of consumer protection, authorising firms that meet the regulator&rsquo;s high standards more quickly, and keeping more potentially harmful firms out of financial services.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The strategy comes as the regulator announces how it will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/feedback/fs25-2.pdf" title="FS25/2: Immediate areas for action and further plans for reviewing FCA requirements following introduction of the Consumer Duty">follow up</a>&nbsp;on its call for industry to identify ways to simplify and streamline its rules and reduce burdens on businesses.</li>

<title>The Best-Performing Fund Brands In Europe And Globally According To The Broadridge Fund Brand 50 2025 Report - BlackRock Maintains Top Position In Broadridge’s Fund Brand 50 Global Asset Manager Rankings, While The Backlash Against ESG Pushes Green Into The Red.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="elementToProof">The latest edition of Broadridge&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://distributioninsight.broadridge.com/#/productSingle/FB50" id="OWAdff1ba53-eca3-cc7f-b16e-2f5e152816fe" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://distributioninsight.broadridge.com/#/productSingle/FB50">Fund Brand 50</a></span></span>&nbsp;(FB50), an annual research study by global Fintech leader&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" id="OWA2645c937-2238-3668-a968-742df7801896" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="http://www.broadridge.com/">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a></span></span>&nbsp;(NYSE:BR) was released today, highlighting the world&rsquo;s best-performing third-party asset management brands. The study reveals that European fund selectors placed higher importance on &lsquo;Appealing investment strategy&rsquo; than their US and APAC counterparts, and turned away from active mutual funds to seek efficient returns in alternatives and active ETFs. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;An unchanged trio of US fund providers top the brand ranking. JP Morgan closed the gap further in 2024 on first-ranked BlackRock, as both groups score highly across all 10 brand attributes, except &lsquo;Social responsibility/sustainability&rsquo;. European groups are still well-represented at the top table, making up five of the top 10, with DWS breaking into the top 10 for the first time,&rdquo;</i></span><i>&nbsp;</i>said<b>&nbsp;Barbara Wall, Director, EMEA Insights, Broadridge.</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Battered by turbulent geopolitical changes, worsening fee compression, and painful cuts to resources, asset managers had to innovate to stay afloat &ndash; with many of the most successful managers diversifying into up-and-coming investment vehicles. The nascent European active ETF and semi-liquid alternatives segments proved two of the most interesting (and profitable) in 2024.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Managers also had to adapt to shifting client needs, adopting new approaches to pricing and client service. While having a distinct product range remains essential, it is more of hygiene factor than a differentiator. Today&rsquo;s fund selector expects intuitive client service, highly effective and strategic communications, and thorough expertise in newer and more complex product segments &ndash; although EMEA selectors place a lower premium on &lsquo;Solidity&rsquo; than their APAC and US counterparts. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The independent study, now in its 14th year, measures and ranks asset managers&rsquo; relative brand attractiveness based on fund selector perceptions: taking into account 10 brand attributes to reveal the top global and regional brands in Europe, APAC, and the US. FB50 also reveals the local market brand leaders in Europe and APAC&rsquo;s most significant retail markets for third-party fund distribution. This is the latest study from Broadridge&rsquo;s Data and Analytics business and highlights the depth and breadth of the firm&rsquo;s global market insights. &nbsp;</div>

<div class="elementToProof"><b>Key insights</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">While BlackRock&rsquo;s position at the apex of the leaderboard has looked unassailable for several years now, second-placed JPMorgan is gaining ground fast &ndash; setting up a showdown for supremacy in Europe next year. The top-five global brands, led by BlackRock, are all industry giants in terms of both assets under management and operational scale. While the top five remain unchanged from last year, there is significant jostling for position in the rest of the top 10 &ndash; as well as plenty of fast risers and new entrants throughout the top 50. This was largely to the benefit of passive specialists, many of whom shot up the rankings. While active managers generally struggled in EMEA, there were some notable risers too, such as Baillie Gifford and Artemis.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">It was a tough year for ESG, as the phenomenon of &lsquo;greenwashing&rsquo; which has been written about so much in recent years &ndash; where managers seek to embellish the environmental bona fides of products with tenuous environmental credentials to make them more appealing to socially conscious investors &ndash; pivoted into something very different as the pendulum of political pressure swung the other way: giving rise to yet another new term, &lsquo;greenhushing&rsquo;. With ESG increasingly out of vogue, several firms strongly associated with sustainability and social responsibility were negatively impacted, most notably Robeco and Nordea. Firms are increas&shy;ingly reluctant to champion their ESG cre&shy;dentials for fear of their brand being politicised or even opened up to legal challenges. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">European investors turned in their droves to new asset classes, with equity ETF providers recording their best year ever, and generalists looking to improve their alternatives offering &ndash; with a particular flurry of activity coming from the number of semi-liquid strategy launches. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Top valued attributes</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The top-five most important attributes in Europe were unchanged overall in FB50 2025 &ndash; although there were some shifts in the order of priority. While &lsquo;Appealing investment strategy&rsquo; retained pole position, &lsquo;Expert in what they do&rsquo; pushed &lsquo;Client-oriented thinking&rsquo; down into third place, as rising client demand for non-traditional asset class exposure proved a key differentiator. &lsquo;Keeping best informed&rsquo; and 'Solidity' retained their top-five placements, as fund selectors expect clear and effective communication, and seek solidity in well-established and well-trusted brands with a proven track record. Selectors also stressed the importance of state-of-the-art communications.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">In a year dominated by notable mergers and acquisitions, &lsquo;Solidity&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stability of investment management team&rsquo; were also high on the radar of fund selectors. Asset managers face a challenge in trying to balance achieving scale and building a reputation in popular and up-and-coming investment strategies on one hand, while working to ensure that acquisitions enrich rather than dilute brand perception on the other.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&lsquo;Social responsibility/sustainability&rsquo; slumped to last place in this year&rsquo;s ranking, where it also finished in APAC and the US. While it would be premature to proclaim the death of ESG, it is certainly in need of a reboot. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Additional findings from this year&rsquo;s study include:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>With ETFs dominating flows and cost pressures rising rapidly, it is no surprise to see the top-10 ranking prominently featuring a number of passive fund specialists.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>While BlackRock maintained its dominant position in the region as a whole, there were some losses at the market level. The global giant was pushed out of the top spots in Germany and Italy by JPMorgan. BlackRock also appears second in Sweden and Switzerland, and has dropped two rungs in France, appearing fourth behind Natixis, Pictet, and Amundi. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Pictet was stung by the backlash against thematic investments, as selectors ditched active funds in favour of less expensive index-tracking products and ETFs. This performance is typical for active managers, although there is a swell of belief that active man&shy;agement will see a recovery this year as gains become harder to come by.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Growing demand for ETFs also affected bond specialist PIMCO, who dropped two rungs into 12th position this year. Some managers found they can get similar exposure from ETFs at a lower price point, and more efficiently than from fixed income products. It wasn&rsquo;t all bad news for PIMCO though, as the firm was widely praised for their communications. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<title>The World Federation Of Exchanges Calls For Greater Role For Derivatives Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global trade association for exchanges and clearing houses, has published a paper today calling for a global, evidence-based refresh of public policy on derivatives. The paper sets out a coherent approach to derivatives in order to nurture their use, especially in regulated, lit environments, to avoid the development of an off-exchange derivatives market that is opaque and less fair to investors.<br /> <br /> It is essential that all types of users have access to derivatives to manage economic uncertainty. This means avoiding bureaucracy and blocks on their use, while monitoring all off-exchange and all uncleared derivatives more vigilantly and systematically. The role of exchanges in price discovery and clearing houses in neutralising counterparty risk should be nurtured, as without a thriving public derivatives market, participants will turn to less well-regulated trading venues to manage risk, jeopardising the health of the financial system.<br /> <br /> Listed markets constitute the safe, reliable, and verifiable core of derivatives, as they do for other financial instruments, and regulators must ensure they can continue to do so. Public policy should rethink measures that push derivatives trading into under-regulated environments and develop a policy framework that encourages trading on lit public markets to benefit from their numerous public-good aspects.<br /> <br /> <strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges,</strong> <strong>said,</strong> &ldquo;Public markets are the best place to trade derivatives. Any policy being considered that impedes the growth of exchange-traded derivatives misunderstands the vital role they play in managing risk. Fifteen years on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is important not to let markets slip into the bad old ways and, if anything, bring more transactions into the scope of margining and clearing. The real risk is that regulatory, tax or other measures push customers into a less well-regulated place.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> <strong>Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the World Federation of Exchanges, said,</strong> &ldquo;Exchange-traded derivatives, with their integral central clearing arrangements, bring clarity as to what the price is and who holds risk positions. They provide the foundation for healthy, well-regulated derivatives markets, which bring huge benefits to savers and businesses, small and large. The balance of regulatory incentives, as between OTC and listed derivatives, should continue to reflect this reality. At the same time, any temptation to load costs onto CCPs, rather than charging the risk-taking market participants, should be resisted to maintain the correct incentives for those risk takers. Measures such as the current EU restrictions on CFDs are a good example of ensuring the highest standards apply across all parts of the derivatives world.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> Read the full paper <a href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=17f987e061&amp;e=979576350c" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;<br /> <br /></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The United States has an enviable entrepreneurial culture and a strong track record of building new companies. Yet, new and small business owners often navigate significant challenges from establishment to growth. These challenges typically include limitations in accessing capital, in developing robust business and professional networks for peer support and opportunities, and in building the comprehensive skills, resources, and social connections that contribute greatly to business resiliency and sustainability. Women and minority entrepreneurs may face even greater obstacles. While business formation is, of course, primarily a matter for the private sector, public policy can and should encourage increased rates of entrepreneurship and business formation&mdash;and the capital, networks, and skills essential for success for all business owners.</p>
<p>Today, I want to highlight the vital role that small businesses play in driving the U.S. economy, consider the challenges in accessing credit that some small business owners face, and offer some practical solutions to help small businesses thrive.</p>
<p><strong>Small Businesses and Their Role in the Economy</strong><br />Small businesses are the heart of the U.S. economy. They produce nearly half of the country's gross domestic product and employ just under half of all private sector workers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Small businesses have created more than 60 percent of net new jobs since 1995, and business applications have remained consistently elevated at around 5 million annually since mid-2020.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;In recent years, women-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses were two of the fastest-growing segments of businesses. The number of small businesses owned by minorities increased by almost 60 percent and the growth rate for women-owned businesses was not far behind at 50 percent during this time period.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;We should all be encouraged by these statistics, as several studies suggest that improving business ownership and entrepreneurship across demographic groups would help grow our economy faster.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>And from an individual perspective, entrepreneurship and small business ownership may offer meaningful economic advantages. Research suggests that entrepreneurship often correlates with enhanced job satisfaction and improved economic mobility for business owners&mdash;though outcomes naturally vary based on multiple factors including market conditions, industry, and individual circumstances.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>As we recognize the value of small businesses, it's also important to recognize that surviving as a small business is not easy. About one in six new businesses fail during their first year and almost 50% fail by their fifth year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;When a small business struggles or fails, the repercussions often extend beyond the enterprise itself. Entrepreneurs who have invested personal savings and assets in their ventures may face significant financial strain, creating ripple effects that impact their families' stability as well as the broader economic health of their communities.</p>
<p>In light of these dynamics, it is essential to understand the fundamental challenges that small businesses face and develop targeted tools and policies that can effectively support entrepreneurs as they start and scale their businesses. Today, let me focus on credit access and the need for more transparency in lending terms.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Credit for Small Businesses</strong><br />Many small businesses need credit to launch and grow their business. Small businesses access financing from diverse sources, including banks of all sizes, credit unions, online lenders, and other nonbank financing companies. Despite this range of sources, the Federal Reserve's Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS) identified credit availability as a challenge faced by over a quarter of small businesses.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In addition, many small businesses face problems with the credit they do obtain.</p>
<p>While access to credit poses challenges for many small businesses, these hurdles can be even more pronounced for women and minority business owners. Research consistently shows that women-owned businesses typically start with smaller amounts of initial capital compared to other firms, even when accounting for factors like education, experience, credit scores, and business characteristics such as industry and growth potential.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Furthermore, women- and minority-owned businesses often encounter distinct obstacles when seeking financing. Minority business owners often have lower credit scores compared to non-minority business owners, which can lead to lower approval rates for loans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Banks, nonbanks, and online lenders have the potential to fill these financing needs. But to be effective, they need to understand consumer preferences and behavior to provide credit products that meet these needs in a safe and fair way.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the Need for Financial Transparency</strong><br />A significant challenge facing small businesses is the absence of policies providing essential tools and protection for small business borrowers. Despite the fact that many small businesses function more like households than Fortune 500 companies, they generally fall outside regulatory disclosure requirements intended to ensure transparency in pricing, facilitate comparison shopping, and protect the financial interest of borrowers.</p>
<p>Consider the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), implemented in Regulation Z, which does not extend protection to small business borrowers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;This exclusion stems partly from the assumption that small business owners possess financial sophistication or can access professional assistance when needed. This regulatory gap matters because business financing offers may present pricing structures that differ substantially from the standardized disclosures that small business owners are accustomed to seeing on consumer credit disclosures.</p>
<p>Research from focus groups conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland revealed that many small business owners struggle with understanding the specialized terminology used by certain nonbank lenders.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;For instance, instead of providing familiar metrics like an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or an interest rate, some nonbank providers present a factor rate&mdash;a fundamentally different metric that cannot be directly compared to an APR or interest rate. The research identified a lender's website that advertised a "factor rate of 1.15" which translated to an undisclosed estimated APR of approximately 70 percent. Further complicating matters, some lenders may disclose an interest rate without including an APR, meaning that various fees and additional costs may not be reflected in the stated rate that borrowers often use to evaluate their financing options.</p>
<p>While complexity sometimes serves a business purpose, in many cases, it obfuscates the costs and can lead to poor financial decisions by small business owners. More broadly, product design by banks and nonbanks should help to counter, not lean into, biases that can lead to poor financial decision-making.<a name="f34"></a>&nbsp;For instance, present bias describes our natural tendency to prioritize immediate benefits over long-term considerations. This might lead business owners to focus more on quick access to funds or low initial payments rather than evaluating the complete long-term cost structure. Similarly, status quo bias suggests that once a small business borrower establishes a lending relationship, they may be less inclined to explore alternatives, even when more favorable options become available. The perceived complexity or uncertainty of refinancing or switching lenders can reinforce this tendency to maintain existing arrangements. Understanding psychological factors and cognitive biases can help small business borrowers make more informed financial decisions by recognizing how the presentation of lending terms might affect their evaluation process.</p>
<p>In light of these realities, banks, small business advocates, and industry stakeholders should support policies that help small businesses better understand risks, and to drive the market towards products that are designed to overcome, not exacerbate, these problems. Potential policies would include enhancing transparency in loan terms, thus enabling business owners to make more informed financial decisions. Additional borrower safeguards worth consideration include ensuring that loan products are sustainably repayable and don't lead businesses into costly reborrowing cycles, as well as ensuring fair treatment both during the loan origination process and throughout any restructuring efforts or collection proceedings.</p>
<p>Some states are moving forward with policies that protect small businesses. California and New York, for example, now require many lenders to offer clear disclosure of the APR and estimated monthly payments.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;This requirement gives borrowers the opportunity to understand the financing being offered in a clear, concise manner, enabling informed comparisons across different product options. Several other states passed versions of disclosure laws for small business financing transactions, with some variability over the range of financing transactions covered and the types of disclosures required.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250324a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p><strong>The Role of Community-Based Programs</strong><br />I want to recognize the important role that community-based programs can play in supporting entrepreneurs. These programs provide accessible tools, technical assistance, and educational resources that help entrepreneurs reach their full potential. Local organizations such as small business development centers, educational institutions, and community development financial institutions are connecting small business owners with personalized consulting, technical assistance and education, and entrepreneurial skills development.</p>
<p>The most successful of these types of programs deliver practical technical assistance and education while fostering collaboration within local entrepreneurial ecosystems. These include university- or community college-based initiatives connecting business owners with volunteer consultants, resource hubs offering workshops, or rural development centers providing specialized support. By emphasizing both skill-building and community connections, these programs help small businesses and entrepreneurs overcome barriers to success.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In conclusion, small businesses are engines of innovation, job creation, and economic mobility in our society. Great work has been done to understand what it takes to help small businesses thrive and grow, including access to sound and affordable credit, skills-building, and business networks. I encourage us to build on this work by enhancing financial transparency, implementing supportive policies, and leveraging community-based programs to enhance business opportunities. These collective efforts to support entrepreneurs and small business owners not only benefit individual enterprises but also contribute to a healthy and dynamic economy that works for all.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reported on the performance of first-lien mortgages in the federal banking system during the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>OCC Mortgage Metrics Report, Fourth Quarter 2024</em>&nbsp;showed that 97.3 percent of mortgages included in the report were current and performing at the end of the quarter, an increase from 97.2 percent one year earlier.</p>
<p>The percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages &ndash; mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held by bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due &ndash; decreased from the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Servicers initiated 6,647 new foreclosures in the fourth quarter of 2024 showing a decrease from the previous quarter and a decrease from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Servicers completed 7,332 modifications during the fourth quarter of 2024, a 1.6 percent decrease from the previous quarter&rsquo;s 7,450 modifications. Of these 7,332 modifications, 6,872, or 93.7 percent, were &ldquo;combination modifications&rdquo; &mdash; modifications that included multiple actions affecting the affordability and sustainability of the loan, such as an interest rate reduction and a term extension.</p>
<p>The first-lien mortgages included in the OCC&rsquo;s quarterly report comprise 20.2 percent of all residential mortgage debt outstanding in the United States or approximately 11.1 million loans totaling $2.7 trillion in principal balances.</p>
<p>This report provides information on mortgage performance through December 31, 2024, and is available on the OCC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/mortgage-metrics-reports/index-mortgage-metrics-reports.html" title="Mortgage Metrics Reports">website</a>.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Setting Out The Value Proposition Of Derivatives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>History enthusiasts may have heard of the Code of Hammurabi, an early legal text from ancient Mesopotamia, carved into a stone slab about 3,700 years ago. The code covers everything from property rights to divorce, but it also recognizes the risk and uncertainty that can exist in economic exchanges and sets out a mechanism for that risk to be transferred and shared. It shows that risk mitigation techniques have been around since the dawn of recorded civilization. Whenever trade has occurred between groups of people, tools have existed to allow them to alleviate uncertainty, transfer risk and enhance profitability. Those tools have evolved significantly over the centuries, but the basic concepts remain unchanged &ndash; and they continue to be applied by companies and governments around the world for one simple reason: they are valuable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes easy to lose sight of this fact &ndash; even among those of us who spend our lives working in the derivatives industry. Which is why ISDA has marked its 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary by publishing a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/03/17/the-value-of-otc-derivatives-empowering-organizations-to-manage-risks-enhance-returns-and-optimize-liquidity/">new report exploring how and why different types of entities &ndash; from multinational companies to pension funds to governments &ndash; use derivatives</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a niche market &ndash; the report shows that derivatives are used widely around the world. Based on analysis of nearly 1,200 companies across seven major stock indices, 87% use derivatives to help manage their business.</p>
<p>These companies use derivatives for a variety of reasons &ndash; from risk transfer, to liquidity management, to bolstering returns. They help create certainty by enabling firms to lock in financing terms, reduce costs, dampen the impact of market volatility and enhance financial performance. This allows companies to plan confidently and make strategic investments, contributing to business expansion and economic growth.</p>
<p>To give an example, an academic study of almost 7,000 firms in 47 countries found that companies using derivatives had lower cashflow volatility, reduced financing costs, higher returns and greater investment capacity. Another study of over 14,000 companies showed those using derivatives to manage interest rate risk on their variable-rate debt faced smaller declines in equity value after rate hikes.</p>
<p>Every day, manufacturers use interest rate swaps to lock in predictable debt costs. Exporters use FX forwards to secure stable conversion rates when receiving overseas revenues. Pension funds employ swaps, swaptions and options to shield retirement assets from shifts in market prices and to augment returns. And mortgage providers use swaps and options to manage interest rate and prepayment risks to keep home financing widely accessible.</p>
<p>From their earliest uses as a tool to create certainty over the future price of a sale of crops in the second millennium BC, derivatives have evolved to become an essential component of any robust, vibrant and competitive economy. It&rsquo;s critical that corporations and governments can continue to access derivatives markets seamlessly and with as little friction as possible, which is why our mission to foster safe and efficient derivatives markets remains as relevant today as it was when ISDA was first established 40 years ago.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak today. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to be back in my home town, and particularly here at Leicester University, not least because I went to school next door.</p>
<p>I am going to speak today about a topical subject &ndash; economic growth. The question I set myself is, what does it take to create a sustained increase in the growth rate of the economy in today&rsquo;s world? I&rsquo;m going to range quite wide in answering the question, drawing in the current situation here in the UK and the world, and some economic history too.</p>
<p>Economic growth is, quite simply, the rate of expansion of the size of the economy. Let me start by explaining how it matters to the Monetary Policy Committee when we decide on the appropriate level of interest rates to achieve our objective of price stability, the 2% inflation target. There are two parts to why growth matters for monetary policy &ndash; the outcome and the inputs. On the first, quite simply, low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to growth in the economy. The same goes for financial stability, our other core responsibility as the central bank, which is also a key condition for growth.</p>
<p>On the inputs side, growth matters because monetary policy decisions require us to assess the inflationary consequences of the pressure on economic resources in this country. That pressure reflects the balance between demand and supply in goods and services and labour markets. To observe that level of pressure, we can&rsquo;t just look at actual national income or output and employment. If that&rsquo;s all we did, we would be left saying &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; We have to compare the actual position with the productive potential of the economy (the supply capacity of the economy) and in doing so assess resource utilisation and thus the degree of pressure.</p>
<p>Except that, we can&rsquo;t observe or directly measure the supply capacity of the economy. It has to be estimated to derive an assessment of potential national income/output. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not going to use algebra today, but just a simple illustration: when we do those estimates, we label actual national income/output as Y, and potential income/output as Y*.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;When Y=Y*, the value of goods and services produced in the economy is at the level where productive factors or resources &ndash; labour, capital and land &ndash; are being used at a sustainable rate, and thus we are at the level of national income/output consistent with inflation being at the target.</p>
<p>In fact, things are a bit more complicated, because productive potential (Y*) has both a long-run structural dimension &ndash; an influence here is the pattern of an ageing population and what that means for future labour supply &ndash; and a shorter run cyclical component &ndash; an influence here is the impact of a shock like Covid on labour supply, or the war in Ukraine on energy and food supply. On this last point, you will note that I have slipped in here that we don&rsquo;t live in a closed economy &ndash; potential supply and actual demand are affected by what goes on in the rest of the world too.</p>
<p>Two more points before I get off this section on definitions. First, in the MPC we spend time working out what we make of a concept called the output gap. Put simply, it&rsquo;s the difference between potential supply and actual production in the economy. It&rsquo;s the difference between Y and Y*, and provides one, but only one, read on inflationary pressures. And, we have to make this assessment looking forwards, as a forecast, because that&rsquo;s where the level of the interest rate now will have its effect. We can&rsquo;t observe the output gap;, so we have to use all the evidence at our disposal to form a view on it as a matter of judgement.</p>
<p>The second point relates to the growth rate of the economy &ndash; the growth of national income/output. What are the components of productive potential (Y*)? I am going to keep this quite simple and stick to two &ndash; the supply of labour, and output per unit of labour. The latter is the simple definition of productivity &ndash; the effectiveness of the use of resources. You can reasonably say at this point, hang on there are three factors of production in an economy: labour, land (meaning all natural resources) and capital. Yes there are. However, it is useful to focus on labour supply and labour productivity, but recognise that the available land and capital supply are important determinants of labour productivity. Most standard models of economic growth will underline the role of investment in physical and human capital (including of course education).</p>
<p>Critically, there is a very direct link between productivity growth and living standards. Investment in capital and innovation which supports productivity growth will feed through to a growth in living standards.</p>
<p>So, what has been going on with the growth of potential supply in the economy in recent times? A spoiler here &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a very good story. I am going to give three figures for three time periods based on Bank staff estimates: the average annual rate of growth of potential supply in the UK economy and the contribution to that growth rate of productivity and labour supply. From 1990 to 2008, the average annual potential growth rate was 2.6%. Productivity contributed 2.2pp and labour supply 0.4pp. After the financial crisis, from 2009 to 2019, the potential growth rate fell to 1.3%pa, of which productivity contributed 0.3pp and labour supply 1.0pp. From 2020 to 2023 the potential growth rate fell further to 0.7%, with productivity contributing 0.5pp and labour supply 0.2pp. Covid was clearly a major factor in the most recent period. The comparable numbers for the growth of demand in the economy &ndash; actual growth &ndash; are: 1990-2008 2.3%; 2009-2019 1.4% and 2020-2023 1.1%.</p>
<p>I think the point comes across clearly. The growth of potential supply has fallen, with the main contributor to that fall being weaker productivity growth. Covid was a major factor in causing a further fall. But it is the decade before Covid that provides a better read.</p>
<p>Productivity growth fell very sharply, and while the labour supply did increase, it did not offset the fall in productivity growth. And, actual growth rates have fallen too, so that actual and potential growth have remained broadly in line.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of living standards, an increase in labour supply does not offset a decline in productivity growth. We can see that by looking at the rate of growth of national income per person (GDP per capita). Between 1990 and 2008 the average annual growth rate was 1.8%. From 2009 to 2019, the annual growth rate was 0.7%. I have not replicated the comparison between 2020 and 2023 because 2020 was a bad year on which to start a comparison given the impact of Covid lock-downs.</p>
<p>The story of growth is, I am afraid, quite clear. It has slowed markedly in the last fifteen years or so, and this has affected the advance of living standards (both as a whole and among groups in society). Moreover, I will add one more important point. Like almost all advanced economies, we have a population that is on average increasing in age, and will continue to do so. Other things equal this will over time reduce the supply of labour to the workforce.</p>
<p>At this point, you can reasonably ask if I can say something to cheer things up? I will have a go, because my title today is: Growth, what does it take in today&rsquo;s world? To do this, I am going to turn to history for a while, and then come back to prospects now. I am going to make some longer-run observations on growth in the British economy, and then draw out some points which are salient to the situation today. They also help to tackle an important question we face today, namely is Artificial Intelligence the next big thing in terms of growth in the economy?</p>
<p>Britain is credited with being the first modern industrial nation. Typically, the definition of modern economic growth in this context is where technological progress is centre stage<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. Recall that GDP growth per capita was 1.8% pa before the financial crisis, but only 0.7% pa afterwards. Looked at in the longer run context, a figure of around 2.2%-2.4% pa was the average from 1950 onwards. And, a figure of about &frac34;% was respectable for the nineteenth century, where the average was a bit under 1% for the period of the so-called Industrial Revolution. All things are relative and close to 1% was a considerable step up on the pre-Industrial era<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Still, we are left with the conclusion that a growth rate of per capita income which disappoints today would have looked respectable during the Industrial Revolution. What&rsquo;s changed? Two things stand out. First, it looks as if the overall growth rate has been enhanced over time as the development of institutions (public and private) and policies has provided an environment that supports growth. This is often known as endogenous growth &ndash; the environment supports and enhances the impact of technological progress and investment. Second, in an open economy such as the UK a key to growth has over time become the prompt and effective diffusion of foreign technology as well as domestic invention<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>. In other words, there is a bigger base of innovation to draw upon.</p>
<p>Having made the point that things have changed in terms of growth rates since the Industrial Revolution, I want to go back to that period to identify four salient features which I believe are highly relevant to understanding today&rsquo;s environment. The four are: technological change; energy supply; population change; and the role of trade. These are all big subjects in their own right, so my treatment of them is going to be quite sparing. The main point I want to draw out is that each of these issues was important in the process of industrialisation, and each of them remains important in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Let me start by attempting to define what is meant by the term Industrial Revolution? A lot of ink has been used on this one. I am going to borrow a definition from the economic historian Tony Wrigley:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The distinguishing feature of the industrial revolution which has transformed the lives of the inhabitants of industrialised societies has been a large and sustained rise in real income per head. Without such a change the bulk of all income would necessarily have continued to be spent on food and the bulk of the labour force would therefore have continued to be employed upon the land &hellip;..only when output growth exceeds population increase substantially and consistently, can there be grounds for supposing that an industrial revolution is in train<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The essence of the definition is that technological change appeared to break the tight link between the economy&rsquo;s endowments of factors of production (land, capital and labour) and income, a break that was not expected to occur by classical economists such as Adam Smith who did not envisage sustained growth<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>. This technological change did not happen as quickly as the word &lsquo;revolution&rsquo; would suggest. Moreover, it didn&rsquo;t happen evenly over time and certainly not evenly across the economy, and that too has led to a lot of ink being used to describe and debate the meaning of the term Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>What are the lessons of this for today? I think there are two lessons. First, if we think we are more or less using the factors of production fully today &ndash; if Y* is near to the production frontier made possible by the state of current technology, then we will need some quite large technological advance to break again the link that Adam Smith and the classical economists described &ndash; in other words, to push the frontier out. I am going to come back to whether AI is that technology. Second, even if the link is broken, it will take time to materialise and spread across the economy. This is a long term process. To be clear though, this does not mean that we can expect no growth without a major breakthrough on technology. Growth rates will go up and down for many reasons. But a substantial and sustained increase in growth most probably does need this breakthrough to happen, as has been case in the past.</p>
<p>Another way of capturing this issue is to ask what has caused the slowdown in productivity growth evident in all the major economies &ndash; not just the UK &ndash; over the last 15 to 20 years. There are two theories on this whodunnit. The first is that it is a consequence of the Global Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>The second is that since the start of the slowdown seems to pre-date the GFC it is due to a trend decline in technological innovation as the ICT revolution of the internet, faster semi-conductors etc., started to slow (and what matters here is the rate of increase of innovation, not the level of it). The evidence seems to provide rather more support for the second explanation, but both could have been at work.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>My second salient feature concerns the supply of energy. To return to Tony Wrigley&rsquo;s work for a moment, he made the point that the Industrial Revolution involved the discovery and application of a &ldquo;method of deriving mechanical energy from a mineral source on a substantial scale&rdquo; and an escape from &ldquo;the problems associated with dependence on organic raw materials&rdquo;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>. Put simply it was a move from burning wood fires to coal burning steam engines.</p>
<p>There are two lessons here for today that I want to draw out briefly. First, the steam engine is credited as the first example of what is called a General Purpose Technology (GPT). In other words, it enabled widespread innovation across many parts of the economy. The economic historian Nick Crafts identified two subsequent such GPTs, electricity from around the turn of the nineteenth to twentieth centuries, and Information and Communication Technology from around the 1970s-1980s. Crafts argued that the contribution from each of these GPTs has grown over time &ndash; each one has contributed more to income growth than its predecessors. This is grounds for optimism. According to his estimates, by 2006 the cumulative productivity gain from ICT had matched that of steam over the roughly century to 1910 suggesting that the progress of technology has become more rapid over time, and that we have become better at putting GPTs to work. Reasons for this improvement include educational advances, better financing and government policies to support R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The second lesson for today from the energy feature of the Industrial Revolution is that we are now seeing the move away from mineral based energy towards so-called renewable sources. This is at the heart of the climate debate. The economics would suggest that it is then a matter of pricing these sources to ensure that we capture the so-called externalities &ndash; the good and bad effects that come from each of them.</p>
<p>My third important feature is population, and labour as a factor of production. Alongside a revolution in technology starting in the second half of the eighteenth century, the UK experienced an unprecedented increase in population which was not directly linked to the development of industrial technology. By the 1860s, the population was more than 3.5 times its level in the 1730s, mainly due to an increased birth rate. From 1780 to 1870 the annual growth rate of the population was around 1.2%. Bear in mind that from 1990 to 2008, the annual growth rate of the potential labour supply was 0.4%, while in the decade after the financial crisis it was 1%. To sustain a higher growth rate of population for a century in the earlier period was impressive.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>When we compare the story of the Industrial Revolution on labour supply with recent times, we can be rather more granular on the modern period. There is a difference between the growth rate of the population and the growth rate of the potential labour supply, but we have the latter calculated only for the modern period, along with its components. Between 1998 and 2007 annual potential labour supply growth of 0.7% was made up of an equivalent growth in population, slightly higher participation in the labour force, slightly lower unemployment, and a fall in average hours worked. In the next decade we saw stronger growth in potential labour supply made up of a similar growth in the population, very little growth in the participation rate, a further fall in unemployment and a rise in average hours worked. The subsequent Covid period up to 2023 saw very little growth in potential labour supply, but a faster growth in population offset by a fall in participation, slightly higher unemployment and flat average hours. Population growth has been the largest recent driver of labour supply growth, with a well-known story on net migration as the major contributor, on which to be clear I offer no value judgement. Meanwhile, labour force participation has fallen, meaning that more people are not seeking to work, though we have some doubts about the data here.</p>
<p>Behind these recent trends is the larger story of the impact of a population which is on average ageing, as is the case in almost all the industrialised countries. Over recent history, the effects of ageing have been offset by increases in labour force participation within age groups, particularly as women remained in the labour force longer, including as the female state pension age rose to equal that of males. But this offsetting mechanism seems to be coming to a natural end.</p>
<p>The conclusion I draw from all of this is that whereas the Industrial Revolution was enabled by a parallel increase in the labour supply, we cannot count on this to the same degree today, even if we do see a return to the more prevailing level of participation pre-Covid. If so, that puts more emphasis on productivity and technological change as the driver of growth to come.</p>
<p>My fourth salient feature is trade and the openness of economies, another big one, and very much a subject of the moment. Let&rsquo;s go back to Adam Smith. One of Smith&rsquo;s important insights can be described by his observation that if a foreign country can supply us with a commodity more cheaply than we can make it, better buy it off them, with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage. That advantage which Smith pointed to would arise from one of his other insights, the benefits of specialisation and division of labour. In this way, Smith set out the view that greater openness through trade will increase competition, productivity and growth<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Nineteenth century economic growth had its origin in technological change, but as the century went on it was reinforced by trade expansion supported by falling transport costs. As the economist Robert Lucas put it, &ldquo;the evidence on trade and growth suggests that the rate of diffusion of technology depends on economic interactions on trade&rdquo;. He added that &ldquo;economic growth is poorly described as the production of more and more of the same stuff&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;physical capital accumulation alone does not suffice to transform a static economy into a perpetually growing one.&rdquo;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;Indeed.</p>
<p>On its own the technological change would not have supported the full Industrial Revolution without a major growth in trade which secured a supply of imported raw materials &ndash; e.g. cotton &ndash; and markets overseas in which to sell the finished goods. Britain&rsquo;s move to free trade after 1846, and the subsequent pattern of tariff reductions in Western Europe was a logical extension of comparative advantage for relatively land scarce but labour and capital abundant economies.</p>
<p>The result of all of this activity was a rapidly developed Atlantic Economy covering countries on both sides of the ocean which had a growing concentration on manufacturing goods. But it is overly simplistic to conclude that the story was a universal generalisation of industrialisation fostered by and fostering the rise of free trade. The story was not that simple. Protection and tariffs were a feature of the more labour scarce New World (notably the USA) in the late nineteenth century, and by the end of the century there were wider signs of a protectionist backlash<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>. From 1914 to around 1950 the world retreated into autarky. There was a backlash against globalisation before the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;World War began in 1914. Nineteenth century industrialisation had created two distributional consequences: within some countries, for instance in the US where tariffs favoured industrial interests; and between the Atlantic economy and much of the rest of the world, with this second effect becoming known as the Great Divergence<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After 1950, trade and openness revived, with a reduction in tariff barriers which was more a product of inter-governmental agreement on a multilateral basis. Over the modern period of time as more countries industrialised, trade flows have increasingly involved the exchange of manufactured goods, including the exchange of goods during the production process. Late nineteenth century trade created income inequalities between countries in the Atlantic Economy and the rest of the world and within countries. In contrast, recent trade developments have started to close those gaps, most notably between China and the traditional industrialised economies.</p>
<p>Income distribution matters when thinking about the relationships between trade and growth. Associated with this point is the degree to which the interaction of trade and growth upends peoples and communities. Recent quite high profile US work on trade policy has made the following point drawing on a comparison with nineteenth century Britain:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the United Kingdom &hellip;.. the repeal of the protectionist Corn Laws prompted agricultural workers to flee the countryside for industrialising urban areas where factory jobs were waiting. By contrast, the American factory workers who were displaced beginning in the 1990s either had nowhere to go or ended-up working in low-skill, low paying service jobs.&rdquo;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>I can trace my own family in Norfolk back to the sixteenth century, but by 1886 they had moved to Dudley in the Black Country, via a one generation stopover in Suffolk. I have no idea whether &ldquo;flee to a waiting job&rdquo; is the right description for their move as they have left no commentary behind.</p>
<p>That said, my family seem to fit the bill for nineteenth century Britain. I should say that it is therefore due to the Industrial Revolution that I was not always popular at school. The reason is that I am a West Bromwich Albion supporter because of the family connection to Dudley, and not a Leicester City supporter, though I try to make up for it as a Leicester Tigers and County Cricket supporter.</p>
<p>Robert Lighthizer, who was the US Trade Representative in the first Trump Administration, goes on to make a key point in this area, namely that his concern is a country, in this case China, running &ldquo;huge trade surpluses with the entire world year after year for decades&rdquo;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[15]</a></sup>. The key point is that in the contemporary world, unlike the nineteenth century, the political economy is not well suited to such persistent trade imbalances with their consequent effects. If that is too subtle, another way to put it is that such a system could be sustained in a world of empires and colonies, but no readily now.</p>
<p>But, two things follow from this. First, Adam Smith and the classical economists were not wrong to make the link between trade and growth. Second, a cause of the contemporary imbalance is at least in part weak domestic demand in a number of countries, of which China is an important one &ndash; i.e. more of China&rsquo;s national income should be spent by its citizens on their own consumption. There are, therefore, also offsetting positions in other countries. We need effective multilateral processes that support getting us to more balanced outcomes.</p>
<p>This is the issue today at the heart of the pressure to return to higher levels of tariffs. To quote Robert Lucas again, until the Industrial Revolution two hundred years ago, the forces of economics:</p>
<p>&ldquo;sufficed to maintain a rough equality of incomes across societies (not, of course, within societies) around the world. The industrial revolution overrode these forces for equality for an amazing two centuries. That is why we call it a &ldquo;revolution&rdquo;. But they have reasserted themselves in the last half of the twentieth century, and I think the restoration of inter-society income equality will be one of the major economic events of the century to come. Of course, this does not entail the undoing of the industrial revolution. In 1800 all societies were equally poor and stagnant. If by 2100 we are equally rich and growing, this will not mean that we haven&rsquo;t got anywhere!<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[16]</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we have to caveat that with some other wise words, namely that &ldquo;(s)upporters of free trade in tangible goods have long recognised that its net benefits to countries typically are distributed unevenly, creating domestic winners and losers&rdquo;<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[17]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Let me draw the history together and put it into the context of achieving sustained growth in the world we face today. The Industrial Revolution led to the so-called Great Divergence, which created an industrialised Atlantic Economy. This transformation was enabled by very open trade in goods, capital flows across the world and likewise unprecedented migration of people (mainly within the Atlantic Economy from Europe to North America). This system fell apart in the first half of the Twentieth Century, with two world wars and the Great Depression.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, up to the 1970s, the world economy was rebuilt under a system that featured strong capital and exchange rate controls, a gradual loosening of the trade controls that had increased between the wars, and greater freedom to pursue domestic policies to avoid the inter-war experience of mass unemployment. After the 1970s this system broke down and the world economy moved on to an era of free trade, capital flows that looked much more like the late nineteenth century, flexible exchange rates, and even more emphasis on independent national monetary and fiscal policies to tackle domestic situations.</p>
<p>It is in this setting that since the 1990s we have seen a further acceleration of the end of the Great Divergence, though not evenly. But, the evidence indicates that this system can lead to persistent large trade and current account imbalances. And here, it is persistence that matters. These imbalances are at the heart of what features so prominently in the news today &ndash; the issue, once again, of tariffs.</p>
<p>You will, I hope be pleased to hear that I am not going to give a further lecture today on this subject. But I will make three important points. First, I agree with work by the IMF which emphasises that persistent imbalances are largely driven by domestic macroeconomic forces &ndash; home grown persistent surpluses and deficits in spending and saving<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[18]</a></sup>. Second, I agree with Lighthizer that free trade is a force for prosperity if it rests on a level playing field, and that the trading system served the world economy well in the period of post-war adjustment up to at least the 1990s. But it has come under strain since then, and most recently we have been forcefully reminded that trade policy has to include a national security dimension. These two points &ndash; domestic macroeconomic forces and trade policy - are not incompatible. They sit together. My final point here is that to solve these issues we need authorities to come together and strengthen the rules of engagement in a multilateral setting.</p>
<p>Let me finish on the subject of AI. I hope I have established the basic argument that links together technological progress, trade and economic growth. I have also argued that we face other headwinds which make achieving stronger growth through that set of linkages more challenging but also even more necessary.</p>
<p>Is AI the next General Purpose Technology (GPT)? A GPT has the potential to be used across a wide part of the economy, like electricity for instance. It is not just a short-lived boost to productivity growth but rather a significant change which keeps improving and lowering costs and makes innovation across the economy easier. It should have a significant and prolonged positive impact on productivity growth, and will itself create new ideas, new products and new ways of doing things. AI appears to me to have that potential, and so it could over time lift growth rates and per capita national income.</p>
<p>In doing so, it should increase the productivity of labour, by both complementing the skills of labour and substituting for labour in some situations. In doing so, it will lead to the re-design of the content of jobs. Again, we can look to the Industrial Revolution for clues here. And, there is a particular Leicester dimension to this piece of history. Probably the most famous resistance movement to such technological change was the Luddites of the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Named after the mythical character &ndash; or at least unidentified &ndash; of Ned Ludd, they were largely made up of framework knitters who resisted the move to mechanised knitting machinery. Leicestershire was one of the centres of Luddite activity. Indeed, very sadly, a number of Luddites were hanged outside Leicester Gaol, almost in sight of where we are today<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/march/andrew-bailey-university-of-leicester-chancellors-distinguished-lecture#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[19]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There was no doubt transitional pain and suffering at the time, and there were not the public institutions and policies of support that we have today. But the Industrial Revolution did not lead to mass unemployment, and I do not believe this will be the case with AI. Moreover, as I said earlier, a big difference from the early nineteenth century to today is that we now have a population that is on average ageing, and the need to complement human labour with technology to support the productive potential of the economy (Y*) is more pressing. So, I am therefore of the view that we must facilitate the growth of AI as the most likely General Purpose Technology which can move the needle on growth in the economy. In doing so, we must also invest in new skills in the labour force- in our human capital.</p>
<p>To conclude, we face a necessary challenge to raise the potential growth rate of the economy. There are strong headwinds. The combination of technology and trade remains an essential route to increasing productivity. Adam Smith&rsquo;s basic tenet is as true today as it was two hundred and more years ago. Growth also requires strong institutions and public policies to provide a supportive environment. Education and universities are part of that story &ndash; to create and encourage the development of human capital so, too is a strong multilateral international institutional framework for economy policy, including trade policy. And, central banks are important too, with our strong commitment to monetary and financial stability.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to wonder, why Y as the letter to denote income/output? The earliest source I know of is a letter written by Keynes in 1937 to a fellow economist, Sir John Hicks: &ldquo;On one point of detail. I regret that you use the symbol I for income. One has to choose, of course, between using it for income or investment. But after trying both, I believe it is easier to use Y for income and I for investment&rdquo;. So, there we are &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t explain why Y, but the great man&rsquo;s view has stuck.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen - Legal Position: Rule Interpretation For Deposits Via Digital Platforms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-legal-position-rule-interpretation-for-deposits-via-digita-2025324/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>An increasing number of banks and other credit institutions are offering savings via digital deposit platforms. This makes them more vulnerable since the deposits volume could decrease rapidly. FI notes in a report that some of the institutions do not sufficiently consider these risks, in part when calculating the liquidity buffer required for such deposits. A legal position specifies how we will interpret the rules.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Deposit platforms are digital banking services that make it easy for consumers to move their money. This mobility can benefit consumers, but it also makes banks and other credit institutions more vulnerable. A report from FI shows that the volume of overnight deposits via the platforms for an individual institution can decrease by as much as 50 per cent from one month to the next. The report also shows that the institutions interpret the rules differently in a way that impacts, among other things, their calculation of the liquidity requirements for deposits via deposit platforms. Several institutions do not sufficiently consider the risks.</p>
<p>In our legal position, we clarify that the firms providing the deposit platforms should be considered deposit brokers. This guides banks and other credit institution in the matter of how they should apply the regulation when calculating the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR).</p>
<p>"We now show how the rules should be interpreted so the institutions can do the same thing and consider the risks. This strengthens their resilience, which is important since we are seeing that deposits via the deposit platforms are increasing," says &Aring;sa L&ouml;&ouml;w, Director of Market and Liquidity Risks.</p>
<h2>Deposits via digital platforms increasingly common</h2>
<p>Since the autumn of 2022, FI has analysed platform deposits by sending a survey to banks and other credit institutions. Between 2022 and the end of 2023, the number of institutions offering deposits via the platforms increased from 14 to 16, according to the report. At the same time, the increase in the deposit volume was estimated to be 24 per cent (SEK 32 million). Our view is therefore that platform deposits have become more common, primarily at smaller credit institutions that primarily fund themselves vi deposits from the public.</p>
<h2>When institutions should adjust the weights</h2>
<p>Our view on how the rules should be interpreted has not previously been known by the institutions. For reporting up to an including 30 September, institutions therefore may use the weights and factors that they have previously used when calculating their liquidity requirements. The weights thus do not need to be adjusted as per 30 September, even if this legal position goes into effect on this date. However, for the next reporting occasion, the institutions should use the weights and factors referred to in this legal position.</p>

<title>Household Savings In Sweden</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Swedes hold a large amount of financial assets, but the distribution of these assets is very uneven. Most Swedes hold a small amount of financial assets, while 5 per cent of the population holds approximately half of all assets. Few have direct savings in shares or funds. Those with large loans can be vulnerable to weakened economic conditions and therefore in general have a greater need for a financial buffer. FI&rsquo;s data indicates that many mortgagors hold a small amount of assets, at least with the same bank where they have their mortgage.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Swedes' holdings of financial assets have increased sharply over the past 20 years. Assets in the form of, for example, savings accounts, funds and shares provide individuals with financial security and the possibility to smooth their consumption across their lifetime. But Swedes also have large loans. Those that have large loans and small holdings of assets are vulnerable to adverse economic events. Assets also affect the resilience of the financial system. Therefore, how assets and liabilities are distributed between individuals is important.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen is tasked with promoting a stable financial system and high level of consumer protection. This assignment includes monitoring assets and savings. In this report, we describe how financial assets are distributed in Sweden and how different groups choose to save over time.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its updated methodology for the assessment of regulatory and supervisory frameworks of non-EU countries. The changes reflect the amendments to the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).</span></p>
<p>The methodology used to perform a thorough assessment of the jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory and supervisory framework is based on the following two questionnaires published on the EBA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/third-country-equivalence-and-international-cooperation">website</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;step questionnaire consists of a preliminary screening to determine whether the main requirements and principles are in place.</li>
<li>The 2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;step questionnaire is a more in-depth examination, systematically mapping provisions of the EU framework with that of the non-EU country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further to aligning the methodology with the latest regulatory developments, the EBA also streamlined its 2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;step questionnaire to improve the overall user experience.</p>
<p>Finally, the content of the questionnaires was moved to an online platform, allowing countries to reply directly via a secured digital format. Upon request, interested non-EU jurisdictions may get a dedicated access to this platform. They may contact the EBA for further information (Equivalence@eba.europa.eu).</p>
<h4>Legal Basis and background</h4>
<p>Article 33(2) provides that the EBA shall assist the European Commission in preparing equivalence decisions pertaining to regulatory and supervisory regimes in non-EU countries following a specific request for advice from the European Commission or where required to do so by the legislative acts referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) 2010/1093.</p>

<title>Bank Of England Launches The 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-launches-the-2025-bank-capital-stress-test-2025324/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-launches-the-2025-bank-capital-stress-test-2025324/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of England (the Bank) has today launched the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test for the seven largest and most systemic UK banks and building societies. The exercise is the successor to the Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS).</p>
<p>The test involves a hypothetical stress scenario which will be used to assess the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, large falls in asset prices, higher global interest rates, and a stressed level of misconduct costs.</p>
<p>The stress scenario is not a forecast of macroeconomic and financial conditions. Rather, like previous concurrent stress test scenarios, it is intended to be a coherent &lsquo;tail risk&rsquo; scenario designed to be severe and broad enough to allow the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC) to assess the resilience of UK banks to a range of adverse shocks. This tail risk scenario is used for the purposes of enhancing financial stability and promoting the safety and soundness of UK banks. By doing so the Bank aims to ensure banks can absorb rather than amplify shocks and have the capacity to continue to serve UK households and businesses.</p>
<p>The 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test has three elements, which include a macroeconomic scenario, a financial markets and traded risk scenario and a misconduct stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The macroeconomic scenario involves a severe global aggregate supply shock leading to deep recessions in the UK and globally. Selected key elements include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>UK GDP falls by 5% in the early part of the scenario;</li>
<li>World GDP falls by 2%;</li>
<li>UK unemployment almost doubles to a peak rate of 8.5% in the third year of the scenario, similar to the peak level experienced in the global financial crisis.&nbsp;</li>
<li>World trade falls by 20%;</li>
<li>Oil and gas prices rise sharply;</li>
<li>Inflation peaks at 10% before falling back to the 2% target by the end of the scenario;</li>
<li>Bank Rate is increased to a peak of 8% and is then lowered over the scenario as inflation returns to the target;&nbsp;</li>
<li>UK residential property prices fall by 28%.</li>
</ul>
<p>The test is also the first since the end of transitional arrangements for the International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) accounting standard, introduced in 2018. The FPC has judged that the change in accounting standards should not lead to an unwarranted increase in capital requirements for the UK banking system. In this context, the Bank is implementing a number of changes relative to past concurrent stress tests which are designed to be consistent with an unchanged FPC and PRC risk tolerance for the resilience of the UK banking system. The Bank intends to use this year&rsquo;s test to assess the impact of these changes and inform future stress tests.</p>
<p>The results of the test will be informed by both the Bank of England&rsquo;s and participating banks&rsquo; estimates of the impact of the stress scenario. The results will be published at an aggregate and individual bank level in 2025 Q4. The results will be used to inform the setting of capital buffers for the UK banking system and individual participating banks, and to inform a broader understanding of risks in the banking system.</p>
<p>As set out in the Bank&rsquo;s updated Approach to Stress Testing the UK Banking System, published in November 2024, the Bank expects to undertake a Bank Capital Stress Test involving submissions from participating banks every other year.</p>

<title>iBTC To Enable Bitcoin-Based Margin Flows For Institutional Counterparties On The Canton Network - The Partnership Marks The First Time Bitcoin Can Serve As Collateral For OTC Derivatives Margin Flows While Maintaining Transactional Privacy And Efficiency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canton Network (Canton) today announced that iBTC, a pioneering,&nbsp;bridgeless wrapped Bitcoin solution designed to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) with institutional-grade security and liquidity, will deploy on the Canton Network. This collaboration brings Bitcoin-based assets on-chain, allowing institutional counterparties to use them for initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) solutions. It unlocks new opportunities and simplifies the integration of Bitcoin into over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading.</p>
<p>Once integrated, market makers will be able to deposit BTC into Canton by wrapping it into iBTC. Counterparties can then engage in margin workflows, utilizing iBTC for IM/VM in trading options and structured products. The unique configurable privacy features in Canton&rsquo;s public network ensure that BTC flows are visible only to the desired market makers, enhancing confidentiality and security. Most significantly, beyond staking yield, iBTC participants can generate yield opportunities through application rewards within the Canton ecosystem.</p>
<p>"At iBTC, we&rsquo;re proud to offer institutions a secure way to tap Bitcoin as collateral, and joining the Canton Network is expanding our ability to do so. With top-tier privacy, liquidity from partners like DRW, and optimized workflows, we're excited to meet the growing demand for streamlined margin needs,"&nbsp;<b>said Aki Balogh, CEO and Co-Founder, of iBTC.</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;The iBTC-Canton integration represents a significant advancement in institutional Bitcoin adoption in the financial markets. By delivering a scalable solution for Bitcoin-based margin flows with configurable privacy on the Canton Network, institutional counterparties can efficiently deploy BTC in structured products and derivatives trading,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Eric Saraniecki, Head of Network Strategy.</b></p>
<p>Key highlights of the integration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin as Collateral:&nbsp;iBTC enables institutions to utilize BTC for IM/VM in a secure and compliant manner</li>
<li>Institutional-Grade Privacy:&nbsp;Each market maker serves as their own iBTC bridge, ensuring secure and confidential Bitcoin transactions</li>
<li>Optimized Workflow:&nbsp;IM/VM cycles occur every 2-4 hours, allowing for seamless Bitcoin movements to meet margin requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>The rollout of iBTC on Canton will initially involve a select group of institutional counterparties, with plans to scale participation to 10-20 firms processing $20-$50 million in daily trading volume.</p>
<p>As part of the integration, iBTC will operate a Canton Network Validator, which offers additional incentives and mining rewards. This initiative aligns iBTC with the network&rsquo;s infrastructure and enhances transaction finality for institutional traders.</p>

<p>CarbonPura pioneers Ghana Green Guard, a transformative series of privately funded environmental protection, restoration, and climate-smart projects and initiatives bespoke to the landscape of Ghana. The Ghana Green Guard Agreement harnesses the power of leveraging a climate futures ecosystem combined with flows unlocked from carbon finance to address critical climate and sustainability challenges while advancing Ghana&rsquo;s environmental restoration and socio-economic development goals.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer of the EPA of Ghana, Prof. Nana Ama Browne Klutse says &ldquo;the Ghana Green Guard Agreement is a significant milestone in Ghana&rsquo;s environmental journey and marks the beginning of a new era in public-private stakeholder engagement to imple&shy;ment development practices and leverage international carbon markets to achieve sustainability, protect our water bodies and secure a healthier and more prosperous future for all Ghanaians.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most significant nature-based project methodology solutions globally it will generate over 305 million high-quality, investment-grade carbon credits across 12 million hectares of diverse landscapes with a projected cumulative revenue of $10.4 billion over 25 years. </li>
<li>Each project supports Ghana&rsquo;s socio-economic and community enhancement programmes and initiatives to empower women, children, and the most vulnerable farmers and communities. Aligns international and local partners, government support, NGO and University Collaboration, all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, and Ghana&rsquo;s net-zero and global climate commitments. </li>
<li>Immediate intervention to enhance Ghana&rsquo;s water security using the most effective and sustainable solutions and technologies that ensure long-term protection and safeguarding for the provision of clean water and the restoration of polluted water sources caused by illegal mining. </li>
</ul>
<p>Ghana Green Guard combines the relationship driven socio-economic benefits of a public&ndash;private partnership to deliver projects that align seamlessly with President Mahama&rsquo;s Policies for the Future of Ghana, Ghana&rsquo;s net-zero and global climate commitments and all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. The agreement will utilise restorative and ecosystem vision - not only in project execution but from new relationship driven economic models fuelled by investment grade biodiversity and carbon credit projects.</p>
<p>Dr. Fred Bedzrah, the Vice President of Operations for CarbonPura Africa, stated that &ldquo;the Green Guard Ghana Agreement sets a new benchmark for environmental and socio-economic impact and is a bold step forward toward positioning Ghana as a leader in sustainable carbon finance by integrating transparent governance, investment grade carbon credit generation, and inclusive community engagement. CarbonPura is proud to deliver a framework that enhances global climate action and ensures tangible benefits for healthier local communities and ecosystems. Ghana demonstrates how high-integrity restorative biodiversity and climate smart projects can drive sustainability and long-term investment confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ghana Green Guard Project leverages 12 million hectares of risk assessed eligible land across various regions of Ghana, strategically and with scientific rigour, chosen for their ecological, biodiversity and socio-economic potential. The expansive project ensures scalable investment-grade carbon credit generation goals and sustained environmental improvement by carefully integrating targeted activities such as reforestation, regenerative agriculture, illegal mining restoration and coastal environment restoration. The Executive Director of PSPH Dr. Francis Adjei adds that &ldquo;True sustainability is not just about restoring the environment&mdash;it&rsquo;s about restoring hope, dignity, and opportunity for the most vulnerable. Through the Ghana Green Guard initiatives, we are ensuring that climate action translates into better healthcare, stronger communities, and a future where no one is left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cath Thrupp, the Chief Executive Officer of Carbon Planet, says that &ldquo;Ghana is leading the way in terms of showcasing a sustainable future for their country and the world. They are actively originating large-scale decarbonisation and landscape restoration programmes that will support their country to transition to net zero. In working with the global carbon markets to support this transition, Ghana is actively creating new jobs and opportunities for local communities. As a company, Carbon Planet is honoured to work with the Government and people of Ghana to create a sustainable future, with no one left behind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Each project methodology activity is designed to deliver long-term environmental and socio-economic benefits, creating a positive feedback loop where ecological improvements&mdash;such as increased biodiversity, improved soil fertility, and enhanced coastal resilience&mdash;foster sustainable community development, employment creation, strengthen food security, provide clean water, eliminate species extinction, and drive long-term economic resilience across regions dependent on agricultural and coastal livelihoods.</p>
<p>Mark Phillips, the Chief Executive Officer of Carbon Capital Corporation, says that &ldquo;through strategic collaboration with Carbon Planet we lead the Ghana Green Guard project origination and ensure that all credits are investment ready, meet the highest standards of regulatory compliance and financial integrity and achieve long term environmental and social impact.

<title>Regulated Blockchain: Foundation For An Effective And Efficient Financial Sector</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The global financial landscape is at a crossroads. While digital financial services have brought convenience and accessibility, they have also introduced new challenges&mdash;ranging from regulatory uncertainty to inefficiencies in cross-border transactions to fraud risks, while still limiting affordability for many due to high costs. A groundbreaking whitepaper,&nbsp;<i>Regulated Blockchain: Infrastructure for regulated DeFi: Foundation for a golden age in finance</i>, authored by fintech visionary Obi Emetarom, presents a transformative framework that addresses these issues and paves the way for a Regulated Internet of Value&mdash;a blockchain-powered financial ecosystem that seamlessly integrates innovation with compliance.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg4692left"><img align="middle" alt="Regulated Blockchain Logo" id="prnejpg4692left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2647201/Regulated_Blockchain_Logo.jpg" title="Regulated Blockchain Logo" /></div>
<p>Traditional finance (TradFi) remains encumbered by high costs, cumbersome processes, and regulatory complexity. According to the&nbsp;<i>World Bank</i>, global remittance fees averaged&nbsp;<b>6.2%</b>&nbsp;in 2023, significantly above the&nbsp;<b>3%</b>&nbsp;target set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), making transactions expensive for millions worldwide. Meanwhile, crypto-based decentralized finance (DeFi) has struggled with trust, adoption, and oversight. In 2023 alone, crypto-related hacks and fraud accounted for over&nbsp;<b>$1.8 billion</b>&nbsp;in losses, according to&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLimQ9cXzbxsTBUkfBFfatLYLx0MuAGIGa4ji-2Fig7K2hjnBCYG8kgtBOG1xi8ESRUYbRShYyIEe-2F8yJDjFfHE8HcA-3DCSZj_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJwWKoNX6qWIsrGSq2AHUHgTeJS7EBeKXSZEE5GoZn03MlbgYxfqE1TsGdBv5rtRN9bVagHD2CqHdDQx12-2BWuMCZ-2BZjdelRT-2FppU4ZsI5fmOl2ZoV8Uu4DpCRBeohFkMdqq7R7GwxT2vVtwqPwtiKa3HyEYvmY04v-2FzTtUdDvV5acCXNfhr-2FHBtmINMAlztK6jmBPupbvH0FGfkJfENxIZHoOdH1Q3sSS-2BHv4Sb3GoZu4np-2BvPwvtIeX-2FRkDx7I3L-2FVLhGfttfSpnWNZ8jY-2BBxiB7-2F-2BQX1bN70TFCU1zZxWjU-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chainalysis</a>, underscoring the need for a more secure and regulated approach.</p>
<p>The whitepaper argues that Regulated Blockchain Infrastructure is the missing link, providing a secure, efficient, and transparent foundation that combines the best of both worlds.&nbsp;<b>Regulated Blockchain is a new way of using blockchain technology to democratize financial services innovation while enforcing clear rules set by financial regulators and enabling real-time oversight.</b>&nbsp;It combines the security and speed of blockchain with the oversight needed to guarantee compliance, prevent fraud and ensure trust. Unlike cryptocurrencies that operate outside government control, Regulated Blockchain allows banks, fintech companies, and payment providers to use blockchain for&nbsp;<b>faster, cheaper, and safer transactions&mdash; all with necessary compliance and regulatory oversight</b>. This means people and businesses can spend, save and invest money more effectively, banks can deliver their offerings more efficiently, and regulators can prevent illegal activities, all while making financial services more accessible to everyone. By embedding regulatory protocols directly into blockchain technology, financial institutions, fintech companies, and regulators can unlock frictionless financial services, automated compliance, and unprecedented levels of transparency.</p>
<p>"This whitepaper is a call to action for policymakers, financial institutions, and innovators," said&nbsp;<b>Obi</b>&nbsp;<b>Emetarom, the paper's author and the CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;</b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLisA2ClZBsQ7GmilziImCpB9DbYqpDTNZ5OlbWLIGYcC-2Boum1_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJwWKoNX6qWIsrGSq2AHUHgTeJS7EBeKXSZEE5GoZn03MlbgYxfqE1TsGdBv5rtRN9bVagHD2CqHdDQx12-2BWuMCZ-2BZjdelRT-2FppU4ZsI5fmOl2ZoV8Uu4DpCRBeohFkMdqq7R7GwxT2vVtwqPwtiKa3HyEYvmY04v-2FzTtUdDvV5aepBMyLZ6DDBDP6qVyo6XOAUjOYQxjJfIliaTq68kmyWqGIQE9LEr-2BbOrzZ2GnELR-2F28smwZKU1aDwEfyrw3p-2FwGPsuHglSAmnKxJLCxLkSE1fIvMBJuaxYalU4FluLwUQ-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Zone</b></a>. "The world cannot afford to operate on outdated financial models. Regulated Blockchain Infrastructure offers a clear path toward a future where financial services are secure, inclusive, and universally impactful. This is not just about improving efficiency&mdash;it's about reshaping global finance to work for everyone, everywhere."</p>
<p>The whitepaper outlines how Regulated Blockchain Infrastructure can accelerate economic growth, maximize financial inclusion, and improve regulatory efficiency. For central banks and regulators, it provides a framework for seamless oversight and risk mitigation while supporting innovation. For fintech firms, it presents a structured pathway for adopting blockchain technology without regulatory friction. For investors and global financial institutions, it creates a transparent and secure environment that enhances capital allocation and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), now being piloted in over 130 countries according to the&nbsp;<i>Atlantic Council</i>, signals growing institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial solutions. The Regulated Blockchain builds on this momentum by integrating programmable compliance, self-custody of assets, and automated financial products to redefine how value is exchanged, stored, and managed globally. Obi's ultimate vision is for multiple Regulated Blockchains to interconnect and jointly function as a Regulated Internet of Value that will power the fully digital and automated economy of the future</p>
<p>With the accelerating pace of technological change, the time to rethink the foundation of the global economy is now. As policy makers, regulators, financial institution leaders, and technology innovators work together to shape the future of financial services, this Regulated Blockchain whitepaper provides a roadmap to a more efficient, inclusive and impactful financial ecosystem.</p>

<title>SET Achieves SBTi Approval For Its Net-Zero 2050 Target, Accelerating Its Plan To Tackle Global Warming</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-achieves-sbti-approval-for-its-net-zero-2050-target-accelerating-its-plan-t-2025324/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>SET has earned the respected validation by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its 2050 net-zero targets, positioning itself among four leading stock exchanges worldwide in achieving the SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term goals.<b><span></span></b></li>
<li>Focusing on reducing the energy and electricity consumption within the organization and collaborating with suppliers to develop joint decarbonization plan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SET President Asadej Kongsiri</b> unveiled today that The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has achieved a significant milestone in its effort to combat the global warming crisis. Through its sustained efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, SET has obtained validation for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an internationally recognized authority on science-based target setting. With this distinction, SET becomes the fourth stock exchange worldwide to secure SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term net-zero targets, standing alongside Bursa Malaysia, Nasdaq and Deutsche Boerse Group. The validated targets include a 42 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and a 90 percent reduction by 2050.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our net-zero target approval by the SBTi reflects our firm commitment to taking concrete environmental actions and aligns with our 2025-2027 strategic plan. This endorsement enhances confidence that SET&rsquo;s emissions reduction plans will effectively meet our net-zero goals in accordance with international standards and the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5&deg;C,&rdquo; said Asadej</p>
<p>The SBTi-validated targets cover all three scopes: 1) Direct emissions from SET&rsquo;s own operations, 2) Indirect emissions from energy consumption, and 3) Other indirect emissions across its value chain. To achieve these targets, SET has developed a comprehensive action plan which includes increasing the use of electric vehicles for transportation, improving energy efficiency in buildings, implementing green procurement policies &ndash; such as collaborating with suppliers to reduce emissions &ndash; and continuously developing innovative products and services that promote investments in environmentally sustainable businesses.</p>
<p>The SBTi is a collaboration between Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi defines and promotes best practices in science-based target setting and independently assesses companies&rsquo; targets. It supports businesses worldwide in setting GHG emissions reduction targets to decarbonize at the pace and scale required to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and keep 1.5&deg;C in reach, aiming to halve global emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Currently, over 7,000 companies and financial institutions are setting science-based targets.

<title>Federal Court Orders Recovery Of Nearly $2.3M For Victims Of An Online Romance Scam - Ruling Stems From A CFTC Complaint Against Debiex</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona issued a default judgment against&nbsp;<strong>Debiex</strong>, a purported digital asset platform.</span><span>&nbsp;The order, issued March 13, finds Debiex liable for fraud in connection with&nbsp;</span><span>digital asset commodity trading and misappropriating over $2 million in customers&rsquo; funds. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8850-24">8850-24</a><span>.]</span></p>
<p><span>The order bans Debiex&nbsp;from trading in any CFTC regulated markets or registering with the CFTC. It also requires Debiex to pay a $</span><span>221,466</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>civil monetary penalty and over&nbsp;$</span><span>2.2 million&nbsp;</span><span>in restitution.</span></p>
<p><span>As part of the scheme, relief defendant&nbsp;</span><span>Zhāng Ch&eacute;ng Y&aacute;ng acted as a money mule when h</span><span>is&nbsp;</span><span>digital asset wallet was used by Debiex to misappropriate at least one customer&rsquo;s funds. Zhang is believed to be a Chinese national. By separate order issued on March 12, the court ordered the remaining digital assets in Zhang&rsquo;s digital asset wallet be returned to the Debiex customer from whom they were fraudulently taken. These digital assets are worth approximately $120,000 before transfer fees.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;This judgment demonstrates the CFTC&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to protecting U.S. citizens from online scams,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Brian Young. &ldquo;I commend Jenny Chapin, Dmitriy Vilenskiy and former Division Deputy Director Joan Manley for their diligent and innovative work on this matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Case Background</strong></span></p>
<p><span>These orders stem from a complaint filed by the Commission on Jan. 17, 2024, which alleged Debiex&nbsp;</span><span>operated publicly accessible internet domains, which it used to&nbsp;target victims with a sophisticated fraudulent scheme&nbsp;</span><span>involving purported digital asset commodity trading</span><span>. As detailed in the complaint, the scheme involved the coordinated efforts of three groups: (1)&nbsp;&ldquo;Solicitors,&rdquo; who contacted customers&nbsp;via at least one U.S.-based social media platform and pretended to befriend or romance the customers to solicit them to open and fund trading accounts with Debiex; (2)&nbsp;&ldquo;Customer Service,&rdquo; which purported to set up and service Debiex trading accounts on behalf of the customers; and (3) &ldquo;Money Mules,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, Zhang, whose digital asset wallets were used by Debiex to accept and/or misappropriate customer funds.&nbsp;</span><span>As further alleged, instead of using the funds to trade on behalf of the customers, as promised, Debiex misappropriated the customers&rsquo; digital assets. U</span><span>nbeknownst to the customers, and as alleged, the Debiex websites merely mimicked the features of a legitimate live trading platform and the &ldquo;trading accounts&rdquo; depicted on the websites were a complete ruse. No actual digital asset trading took place on the customers&rsquo; behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Division of Enforcement thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the FBI&rsquo;s Phoenix Office.</span></p>
<p><span>The DOE staff responsible for this case are Jenny Chapin, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, and former CFTC Deputy Director Joan Manley. Additional DOE staff who assisted include Jennifer Diamond, Mary Lutz, and Elizabeth Padgett from the DOE&rsquo;s International Enforcement Cooperation Unit.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>* * * * * *</span></p>
<p><strong>CFTC&rsquo;s Efforts in Fighting Online Scams</strong></p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection advisories about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/romancefrauds">Romance Frauds | CFTC</a>, which warns users of online dating and social media platforms about an increase in scams that lure victims into sending their money to fraudulent websites that claim to trade foreign currency exchange (forex) contracts, precious metals contracts, and/or digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

<title>America’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors Urge Congress To Reauthorize Cybersecurity Information-Sharing Law</title>

<p>Industry leaders from the financial services, energy and technology sectors&nbsp;<a href="https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025.03.21-BPI-Letter-to-Congress-re-CISA-2015-reauthorization.pdf" target="_blank">urged Congress today</a>&nbsp;to take action to reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA 2015), before it expires on September 30, 2025. In a letter to Senate and House leadership, the coalition warned that failure to act could eliminate a valuable tool used to protect America&rsquo;s critical infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This voluntary information-sharing framework has been instrumental in strengthening our collective defense against cybersecurity threats that continue to grow in sophistication and severity,&rdquo; the letter states. &ldquo;The expiration of these protections risks creating a chilling effect on this critical information exchange&mdash;leaving us all more vulnerable to nation-state attacks and cybercriminals moving forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bipartisan CISA legislation &mdash; enacted in response to the 2015 Office of Personnel Management data breach &mdash; provides private sector entities with important information and liability protections for sharing cyber threats with CISA. It also includes an antitrust exemption that provides similar protections for sharing between private companies.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alliance for Digital Innovation</li>
<li>American Bankers Association</li>
<li>American Public Power Association</li>
<li>Bank Policy Institute</li>
<li>Business Software Alliance</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday released annual audited financial statements for the Federal Reserve System for 2024. An independent accounting firm issued unqualified opinions, asserting that its audit found no material misstatements in accordance with applicable auditing standards.</p>
<p>The Board released audited individual and combined statements for the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, the Board, and one limited liability company (LLC), relating to the Board's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The audited financial statements provide information about assets, liabilities, and operations as of December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Act requires the Board to order an annual independent audit of the financial statements of each Reserve Bank and the Board. The Board engaged KPMG LLP, a public accounting firm, to audit the financial statements of the Federal Reserve System in accordance with applicable standards. The firm also conducted audits of internal controls over financial reporting for the 12 individual Reserve Banks and the Board.</p>
<p>In addition to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/audited-annual-financial-statements.htm">annual audited financial statements</a>, the Board also publishes a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/">weekly comprehensive balance sheet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/combined-quarterly-financial-reports-unaudited.htm">quarterly financial reports</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It&rsquo;s great to see you all here.</p>
<p>I anticipate discussion today around two big questions: one, are crypto assets securities subject to SEC jurisdiction under existing law; and two, should they be? Enhancing regulatory clarity is a laudable goal. So is reasoned policy debate. As long as our goal is to promote compliance with, and not avoidance of, a legal framework that is faithful to the SEC&rsquo;s mission to protect investors and the markets.</p>
<p>As we delve into today&rsquo;s topics, we must bear in mind that the stakes could not be higher. You will be discussing the legal underpinnings of the $120-trillion U.S. capital markets, which remain the envy of the world. The financial wellbeing of tens of millions of Americans, and countless American businesses, depends on consistent and effective regulation of our markets. This regulation rests on a well-built edifice of law that, over the last 90-some years, has been duly built up by Congress and the courts. At the foundation of that structure is the definition of a &ldquo;security.&rdquo; And the Commission has used this definition for decades to successfully regulate an incredibly diverse array of financial products.</p>
<p>We cannot poke holes in the foundation without expecting the walls may crack. Modifying the law to facilitate the success of a chosen product category is fraught with risk. Risk not only of weakening regulatory protections for that category, but of creating a negative domino effect on other areas of the market protected by the same laws. For the SEC, holistic protection of the markets has always been and must remain our North Star.</p>
<p>That said, I understand there is a view that current law is not working for crypto. And I agree that policy must keep pace with new products and technologies. I welcome a diversity of views, and urge you to present those views with careful consideration of the potential benefits and costs of proposed actions. This means asking, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li class="paragraph">What authority does the Commission have to make such changes?</li>
<li class="paragraph">How do you balance the desire for greater clarity with the need for a sufficiently flexible definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo; that cannot be easily evaded?</li>
<li class="paragraph">Does the contemplated change protect investors, the capital markets, and national security? This is critical given the heightened risks associated with crypto assets, including, just to name a few, their speculative nature, a disproportionately high volume of scams and frauds, lack of legal redress available against bad actors that are unidentifiable or located abroad, and use of crypto assets to finance crime and terrorism.</li>
<li class="paragraph">If the intention is to create special rules for crypto assets, how can those assets, either as a group or by specific type, be clearly defined and differentiated from other types of assets to which those rules are not intended to apply?</li>
<li class="paragraph">Will any new legal framework for crypto assets deliver a similar level of investor and market protections to that of other, similar asset classes? Will it provide a level playing field among market participants?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to hearing a variety of viewpoints today on these and other issues. Thank you to the Crypto Task Force for organizing this event, and thank you all for your participation and engagement with the Commission.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon and welcome to the Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s inaugural roundtable, which will explore the complex legal issues involved in classifying crypto assets under the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>In the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis, a person or group going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper describing a new peer-to-peer electronic cash system called Bitcoin that helped form an entirely new digitally native asset class.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Seventeen years later, market participants, lawyers, academics, policymakers, and regulators are still grappling with critical questions related to the status of these novel crypto assets under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;This disagreement is most pronounced when it comes to application of the investment contract test established by the Supreme Court in its 1946 opinion in&nbsp;<i>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.</i><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;(known as the &ldquo;<i>Howey</i>&nbsp;test&rdquo;) to crypto assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The challenges in applying&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>&rsquo;s investment contract test are not unique to crypto. I have firsthand experience with it: as Chief Advisor to the California Corporations Commissioner, I argued before a California appellate court that the offering of a non-security certificate of deposit packaged with the separate receipt of a bonus payment constituted an investment contract.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Although the state court concluded that it was not,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;other federal appellate courts have held that similar arrangements satisfy the&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>test.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In the years following&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>, various courts of appeals are split on various nuances and other aspects of that decision. For example, does&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>require the pooling of investors&rsquo; funds and pro rata distribution of profits<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;or is it sufficient that investors need only share risk with the promoter?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;In some circuits, the fortunes of all investors must depend on the promoter&rsquo;s expertise,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;but in other circuits, the fortune of the investor must be &ldquo;interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, the courts of appeals are divided as to whether an investment contract requires post-sale efforts by the promoter or if &ldquo;significant pre-purchase managerial activities undertaken to insure the success of the investment&rdquo; suffices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Differences in opinions among various courts is not unusual. After all, a judicial opinion is limited to the particular facts and circumstances of that case. When judicial opinions have created uncertainty for market participants in the past, the Commission and its staff have stepped in to provide guidance.</p>
<p>For example, the Commission clarified the meaning of an investment adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary duty under section 206 of the Advisers Act in response to industry demand.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The Commission also opined on the application of&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>to offers and sales of whisky warehouse receipts<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and condominiums,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-crypto-roundtable-032125#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;among other things. This approach of using notice-and-comment rulemaking or explaining the Commission&rsquo;s thought process through releases &ndash; rather than through enforcement actions &ndash; should have been considered for classifying crypto assets under the federal securities laws. Today&rsquo;s roundtable is an important first step in addressing that concern.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Crypto Task Force and panelists for your time in preparing for this roundtable. I look forward to the discussions to follow.</p>

<title>At The SEC: It Is Finally Spring, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., March 21, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Acting Chairman Uyeda and Commissioner Crenshaw. I am delighted to welcome everyone to the inaugural roundtable of the Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity series. Thank you to our panelists, who bring years of experience and serious consideration of the topic at hand to the table. It is fitting that today&rsquo;s panel takes place exactly two months after Acting Chairman Uyeda announced the formation of the Crypto Task Force and just as D.C. is brimming with signs of spring. Spring signifies new beginnings, and we have a new beginning here: a restart of the Commission&rsquo;s approach to crypto regulation. The formation of the Crypto Task Force gave permission to staff in the building to work earnestly towards a workable framework for crypto regulation, and staff have responded with palpable enthusiasm. The enthusiasm in this room is also palpable, so let us seize the moment and have a meaningful conversation today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This room is full of people&mdash;on the panel, on the Crypto Task Force, on the Commission staff, and in the audience&mdash;who are ready for sprint ahead. People have been talking, thinking, and writing about the issues with which we are now wrestling. The roundtable series will allow us to explore the issues collaboratively. I am reminded of a story my brother told me recently. He invited a friend over and walked him back to see a shed on his property that was in poor repair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth saving, is it?&rdquo; he asked his friend. &ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; the friend who is quite handy replied, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get your tractor and haul in some lumber.&rdquo; &ldquo;But my tractor isn&rsquo;t working at the moment,&rdquo; said my brother. &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s fix it.&rdquo; So that day they repaired the tractor and the shed with impressive alacrity</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s panelists have to get the tractor running&mdash;address definitional questions&mdash;so we can build the shed&mdash;design a sturdy and functional regulatory framework. They are as adept as my brother and his friend, so I have high hopes for what we can accomplish today.</p>
<p>To do this work well, we have to tackle some foundational questions about security status.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes something a security?</li>
<li>Is that status permanent, or might an asset start as a security and convert to a non-security, or vice versa?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How does decentralization affect the analysis?</li>
<li>Can we translate the characteristics of a security into a simple taxonomy that will cover the many different types of crypto assets that exist today and will exist in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to everyone who made today&rsquo;s roundtable possible. A lot of work went into making this happen. I look forward to the conversation and am happy to turn over the stage to our esteemed panelists and moderator, former SEC Commissioner Troy Paredes.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority To Scrutinise Whether Pure Protection Market Provides Fair Value To Consumers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-to-scrutinise-whether-pure-protection-market-prov-2025321/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has launched a market study into how well the distribution of pure protection insurance products &ndash; which support families with financial commitments if someone becomes critically ill or dies &ndash; is working for consumers. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In 2023, around &pound;4.85bn was paid out in claims on individual policies to support people suffering from bereavement, illness, and injury.</p>
<p>The review will explore how effectively this important market is working. While the FCA has seen indications of good outcomes for consumers and relatively few complaints, there are concerns that commissions used to sell these products may affect the outcomes consumers receive and the products&rsquo; value or design.</p>
<p>The FCA committed to looking into the sector in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-1-1-market-distribution-pure-protection" title="MS24/1: Pure Protection Market Study">further detail</a>&nbsp;in August last year, but prior to launching, took feedback from the market on the terms of reference.</p>
<p>The study will examine whether: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the structure of commission encourages advisers to suggest switching that may not be beneficial for consumers &nbsp;</li>
<li>premiums are being raised by insurers to pay a higher commission to an intermediary</li>
<li>the products provide fair value</li>
<li>the market supports innovation and growth</li>
</ul>
<p>The market study will focus primarily on the sale of four products &ndash; term assurance, critical illness cover, income protection insurance and whole of life insurance. It will allow the FCA to carry out a more detailed analysis in these areas using its competition powers and the launch does not presuppose any particular outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial findings and any proposed next steps will be published by the end of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, executive director of supervision, policy, competition and international at the FCA, said: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'Consumers rely on pure protection to provide an important safety net, often when they are at their most vulnerable be it through bereavement, illness, or injury. We are determined to ensure the market is working well and delivers good outcomes for consumers by testing it or suggesting improvements.</p>
<p>'In launching the study today, we will be able to take a closer look before considering next steps. We will keep stakeholders regularly updated and welcome the feedback to date that will help us plan the scope of this review.'&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/market-studies/ms24-1-2.pdf" title="ms24-1-2.pdf">Terms of Reference (PDF)</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA published the draft terms of reference in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-1-1-market-distribution-pure-protection" title="MS24/1: Pure Protection Market Study">August 2024</a>&nbsp;for a market study into the distribution of pure protection products to retail consumers.</li>
<li>Changes the FCA has made to the terms of reference after listening to stakeholders include: 
<ul>
<li>further clarification on the scope of the market study, including that private medical insurance is out of scope, as well as funeral plans and accident, sickness, and unemployment products</li>
<li>being clear that we will develop a better understanding of: 
<ul>
<li>barriers to innovation and investment</li>
<li>the &lsquo;protection gap&rsquo; &ndash; the extent to which customers, who would benefit from cover, are not adequately covered, and</li>
<li>&lsquo;access to cover&rsquo;- access for those customers that fall outside a typical definition of a 'healthy life', such as those with existing medical conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Term assurance: a policy which pays a lump sum to beneficiaries if the policyholder dies within a specified period. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Critical illness cover: a policy which pays a lump sum to the policyholder if they are diagnosed with a prescribed (non-fatal) serious illness or medical condition. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Income protection insurance: a policy which replaces part of a policyholder&rsquo;s regular income if they become unable to work because of illness, accident, or disability. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Whole of life insurance, including guaranteed acceptance over 50s life insurance plans: these policies provide cover for the policyholder&rsquo;s lifetime, paying out a lump sum to beneficiaries on the policyholder&rsquo;s death. Guaranteed acceptance is a type of whole of life insurance which doesn&rsquo;t require medical or health information for an individual to qualify for cover.</li>
<li>One of the FCA&rsquo;s primary operational objectives is to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. Further information about our competition objective and our market study process can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-approach-competition" title="Our Approach to Competition">here</a>.</li>

<title>Bank Of England - Asset Purchase Facility: Gilt Sales – Market Notice 21 March 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-21-march-2-2025321/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-21-march-2-2025321/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At its September 2024<strong>&nbsp;</strong>meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts held in the APF by &pound;100 billion over the period from October 2024 to September 2025, to a total of &pound;558 billion.</p>
<p>The Bank set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2022/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-september-2022"><strong>consolidated APF gilt sales Market Notice</strong></a>&nbsp;published on 1 September 2022 that it would publish a quarterly schedule for the sales of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes. The details and schedule for the Q2 2025 sales of such gilts are set out in this Market Notice, which covers the period from 7 April 2025 to the week commencing 28 April 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/december/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-15-december-2023"><strong>15 December 2023 Market Notice</strong></a>, the Bank will set a schedule of auctions in order to continue to reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors, measured in initial proceeds terms. The maturity sectors are defined as gilts with a residual maturity of between: 3-7 years (short), 7-20 years (medium) and over 20 years (long).</p>
<p>Accordingly, in Q2 2025, and consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2024/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-19-september-2024"><strong>19 September 2024 Market Notice</strong></a>, the Bank will sell short maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;750 million, medium maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;750 million, and long maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;600 million. Further details are outlined in the table below.</p>
<p>Other than as amended in this Market Notice, the detailed operational parameters and participation requirements set out previously will apply to these gilt sales.</p>
<p>The Bank will continue to monitor the impact of its gilt sales programme on market conditions, and reserves the right to amend its schedule, including the gilts to be sold and the size of its auctions, or any other aspect of its approach at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>The Bank expects to announce the sales schedule for Q3 2025 at 4.30pm on 20 June 2025.</p>

<title>Athens Exchange Group Response To Media Reports Regarding The Closing Prices Of The Alternative Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="scroll-animation visible">In response to recent media reports referring to alleged inaccuracies in the closing prices of the Alternative Market, the Athens Exchange Group (ATHEX Group) would like to offer the following clarifications:</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span>We categorically affirm that at no time was there any deviation or distortion of the official market closing prices on the part of the ATHEX Group.</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">ATHEXGROUP applies high service standards to support its Members and all market participants, ensuring full transparency and reliability in the information it provides.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">Furthermore, we note that all users of the website, either Members or any third party, must comply with the terms of use, which are clearly outlined on the relevant section of the site. Any further processing and use of data downloaded from the website is the sole responsibility of the end user.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">Specifically, regarding the content of recent media publications:</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">ATHEXGROUP provides official and complete closing price data with full transparency and accuracy to market participants and the general public through the following channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Licensed Data Vendors</li>
<li>Subscription-based statistical data services</li>
<li>The official website of the &Alpha;thens Exchange Group</li>
<li>And, for ATHEX Members, also through trading applications and APIs such as ATHEXTrader and FIX API</li>
</ul>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">Closing prices published on the ATHEX website are publicly available and free of charge, and are fully aligned with the official figures published in the Daily statistical Bulletin and formal data feeds.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">The website also includes downloadable .txt format closing price files. These are machine-readable files provided in line with a long-established and publicly documented technical format, designed to ensure compatibility with older systems still in use by some users.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">Following the recent launch of the new ATHEX website, the technical specifications of these files were updated. However, in response to feedback from certain ATHEX Members who indicated challenges in immediately adapting their systems, the Exchange swiftly decided to restore the files to their previous format. Members were officially informed of this adjustment on March 7, 2025, and were advised that until the update was implemented on the new website, they would receive the legacy-format files via email daily to ensure uninterrupted system operation. The technical update was finalized on March 18, 2025, followed by a second notice to Members.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">All related communications and notices are available to the relevant supervisory and regulatory bodies upon request.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">Despite these measures, we understand from the media reports that there was an isolated case in which closing prices of Alternative Market shares were erroneously sent from a Member firm to its clients multiplied by 10,000, due to incorrect handling of the data by their internal systems.</p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible">The Athens Exchange Group bears no responsibility for any incorrect portfolio valuations that may result from improper processing or usage of the provided files.</p>

<title>Statement By Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I supported no change in the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings.</p>
<p>Reducing the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is an important part of normalizing monetary policy implementation and reducing unneeded reserves in the banking system. Slowing further or stopping redemptions of securities holdings will be appropriate as we get closer to an ample level of reserves. But in my view we are not there yet because reserve balances stand at over $3 trillion and this level is abundant. There is no evidence from money market indicators or my outreach conversations that the banking system is getting close to an ample level of reserves.</p>
<p>The Committee slowed the pace of redemptions in June 2024 to help ensure a smooth transition to the appropriate level of securities holdings needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. I believe that pace continues to be the right one.</p>
<p>If unanticipated disturbances to reserve demand emerge on the path to balance sheet normalization, the Federal Reserve System has a variety of tools to address such a development. Rather than changing our current pace of balance sheet reduction, the Federal Reserve should rely on those tools and develop a plan for how to respond to short-run strains if they emerge. Such a plan could be implemented swiftly in the event more reserves need to be injected into the banking system. Even with the decision to slow the pace of runoff at this meeting, a plan is still required should a disturbance occur in the future. While this is a procedural matter, good process leads to good outcomes, and good contingency planning helps avoid disruptions to markets and to the FOMC's efforts to achieve our economic objectives.</p>

<li>Prepayment activity (SMM) fell to 0.46% in February, the lowest level in a year, on higher rates and a seasonal dip in home sales</li>

<title>Business Confidence Soars As Market Looks Ahead To Volatility Under Trump 2.0</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Business confidence across the global derivatives market continued to rise this quarter as volatility gripped global markets and some exchanges posted record volumes, the SGX Global Market Sentiment Index, a barometer of sentiment from across the global derivatives market, has found.</p>
<p>The Sentiment Index is produced by Acuiti and based on a quarterly poll of Acuiti&rsquo;s Expert Networks, comprising senior, derivatives-focused executives from hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms and the sell-side. Each quarter, Acuiti surveys Expert Network members on their outlook for the next three months to compile the index.</p>
<p>This quarter, the index posted its third consecutive quarterly rise to a reading of 78, up from 72 in Q4 2024.</p>
<p>This increase was driven by the sell-side where business confidence from both clearing and execution-focused executives rose to record levels. Proprietary trading firms and hedge funds also posted sentiment increases. Asset managers, however, saw declines in confidence.</p>
<p>Regionally, confidence was driven by increases in North America and Europe, while the outlook in APAC was more cautious. Overall, the index for respondents in APAC sat at 72, only a marginal increase on last quarter&rsquo;s level of 67. The North American index meanwhile was at 82.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second term of President Trump started with a bang in terms of volatility on global derivatives markets,&rdquo; says Will Mitting, founder of Acuiti. &ldquo;For institutions that are volume based, such as sell-side clearing firms and proprietary trading firms, volatility brings significant opportunities to grow revenues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the growing optimism is not universal with executives in APAC and those from asset managers recording less optimism about the quarter ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Volatility is driving a marked increase in capital flows into and across our pan-Asian waterfront.&nbsp; Our total derivatives traded volume saw month-on-month increases since the start of this year, with a 17% year-on-year hike in February.&nbsp; We are seeing more global investors seeking to benefit from portfolio margining capital efficiencies as they diversify into highly liquid asset classes,&rdquo; observed Rama Pillai, Global Head of Sales at SGX Group.</p>
<p>This quarter, the report also takes a look at how volatility is impacting firms across the global market.</p>
<p>The data finds that, while volatility is highly positive to most company segments, it is posing challenges from higher margin requirements to liquidity and market access issues.</p>
<p>In response to recent market trends, firms are turning to automation and technology. This is particularly important for the sell-side &ndash; 82% of whom said that they were deploying this strategy as they seek to boost capacity and risk management.</p>
<p>Firms were also adopting new risk management frameworks and expanding into new instruments. Proprietary trading firms were seeking to capitalise on the opportunity by increasing their exposures to high-volatility markets.</p>
<p>The next SGX Global Market Sentiment Index Report will be released in June 2025.</p>

<title>CFTC Staff Issues Interpretation Regarding Financial Reporting Requirements For Japanese Nonbank Swap Dealers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Market Participants Division today issued interpretation concerning financial reporting obligations for nonbank swap dealers subject to regulation by the Financial Services Agency of Japan (Japanese nonbank SDs).</p>
<p>On July 18, 2024, the Commission issued a comparability determination and related comparability order granting substituted compliance in connection with the CFTC&rsquo;s capital and financial reporting requirements to Japanese nonbank SDs, subject to certain conditions in the order (<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/FederalRegister/final-rules/2024-15092.html">Japanese Comparability Order</a>). One of the conditions in the Japanese Comparability Order, condition 9, requires each Japanese nonbank SD to file a copy of its home regulator Annual Business Report with the CFTC and the National Futures Association (NFA).</p>
<p>The staff interpretation clarifies that Japanese nonbank SDs may satisfy condition 9 of the Japanese Comparability Order by filing with the CFTC and the NFA certain enumerated schedules of the Annual Business Report (In Scope Schedules), subject to the translation, U.S. dollar conversion, and deadline requirements of condition 9.</p>
<p>The interpretation was issued in response to a request from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association on behalf of its Japanese nonbank SD members that rely on the Japanese Comparability Order.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Ceases Examinations For Reputation Risk</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced that it will no longer examine its regulated institutions for reputation risk and is removing references to reputation risk from its Comptroller&rsquo;s Handbook booklets and guidance issuances.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s actions support the OCC&rsquo;s mission and its supervisory objectives to ensure that banks have appropriate and strong risk management processes for their business activities, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The OCC&rsquo;s examination process has always been rooted in ensuring appropriate risk management processes for bank activities, not casting judgment on how a particular activity may fare with public opinion,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. &ldquo;The OCC has never used reputation risk as a catch-all justification for supervisory action. Focusing future examination activities on more transparent risk areas improves public confidence in the OCC&rsquo;s supervisory process and makes clear that the OCC has not and does not make business decisions for banks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The removal of references to reputation risk from OCC handbooks and guidance issuances does not alter the OCC&rsquo;s expectation that banks remain diligent and adhere to prudent risk management practices across all other risk areas. The OCC expects to complete its efforts to update its public documents in the coming weeks.</p>

<title>Crypto Mining Statement: The Flame In Plato’s Cave, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, March 20, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>The Acting Chairman&rsquo;s office has directed the staff to issue yet another non-binding interpretation bringing the running tally to at least 10 such actions in 9 weeks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Rather than engaging in an open and transparent process that benefits from the input of market participants, these supposedly &ldquo;clarifying&rdquo; statements deliver neither progress nor clarity.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s statement suffers from a few problems. First, the logic is flawed. The statement assumes a hypothetical situation as true (relying on its ability to read the minds of crypto miners). Specifically, it declares with certitude that miners choose to mine &ldquo;merely&rdquo; to receive rewards in the form of crypto assets, not to profit from the managerial efforts of others. Accordingly, the statement finds, crypto mining does not fall under the definition of a security. If you start with an assumption that mining is&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>undertaken with the expectation of profits based on the efforts of others, you will necessarily conclude that it does not involve such an expectation and is therefore not a security.</p>
<p>Next, potentially in recognition of the limitations of its flawed logic, the statement cabins itself. It purports to address only &ldquo;PoW [Proof of Work] generally&rdquo; and not &ldquo;all of PoW&rsquo;s variations or any specific PoW protocol.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;So, this non-binding statement generally applies to mining. Except when it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Finally, buried in the footnotes, the statement reveals its true limitation: one actually would have to conduct a&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>analysis to know if a specific mining arrangement constitutes an investment contract. In fact, the footnote accurately notes that to make a &ldquo;definitive determination&rdquo; under&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>, one would need to analyze the economic realities and real-world arrangements, including &ldquo;the way in which pool members may be compensated, how miners or other persons may participate in mining pools, or the activities conducted by pool operators,&rdquo; and other &ldquo;facts relating to the specific Mining Activity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In short, the statement leaves us exactly where we started: with a facts and circumstances application of&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>. For the sake of investors, other market participants, and the markets themselves, I hope that readers do not mistake it for something more than it is.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The meme coin statement issued by the staff similarly cautioned (again, buried in a footnote) that its discussion was limited to what it called &ldquo;typical&rdquo; meme coin offers and that a determination as to any specific coin would require a facts and circumstances analysis under&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Predictably, these cautionary footnotes were largely ignored and the statement was widely reported as a wholesale exemption for meme coins.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-crypto-mining-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;I hope that the statement on crypto mining is more accurately understood for what it is and is not. Beware of any headlines that herald a wholesale exemption for mining. And mine the fine print.</p>

Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/webcasts">Open session Council meetings are made available to the public via live webcast and can also be viewed after they occur</a>. Upcoming Council meeting dates and times are posted following the official notification to Council members of an upcoming meeting.</p>

Council members discussed cyber-related financial stability risks and the need for continued interagency coordination and information sharing.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, the Council received an update by Director Dwyer, Director Seitz, and staff of the Federal Insurance Office on the homeowners insurance sector, with a focus on the impact of recent natural disasters.

<title>ISDA IQ - International Banker: Appropriate Capital Rules Are Critical For Financial Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&ldquo;Setting capital requirements for globally active banks is a fine balanc&shy;ing act. As regulators learned during the global financial crisis, insuffi&shy;cient capital creates vulnerabilities in the banking sector that can have damaging consequences in times of stress. However, if banks are required to hold disproportionately high levels of capital, this will con&shy;strain their ability to act as intermediaries, negatively affecting liquidity in financial markets. To avoid both scenarios, policy&shy;makers have a critical responsibility to get the balance right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the final parts of the Basel III capital framework are implemented around the world, striking this balance is more im&shy;portant than ever. As it stands, the draft Basel III endgame package that US regulators presented for consultation in 2023 would tip the balance too far. Based on ISDA&rsquo;s analysis of the impact on banks&rsquo; trading books, there is no doubt that the rules would constrain the capacity of US banks to offer vital intermediary ser&shy;vices and have a negative impact on mar&shy;ket liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ISDA CEO Scott O&rsquo;Malia wrote an article for the Winter 2025 edition of International Banker magazine, in which he explains why the calibration flaws in the Basel III endgame package must be rectified, and why US policymakers should also consider the impact of the proposed rules on market functioning and liquidity, including the provision of central clearing.</p>

<title>Statement On Certain Proof-Of-Work Mining Activities, SEC Division Of Corporation Finance, March 20, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As part of an effort to provide greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;the Division of Corporation Finance is providing its views<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;on certain activities on proof-of-work networks known as &ldquo;mining.&rdquo; Specifically, this statement addresses the mining of crypto assets that are intrinsically linked to the programmatic functioning of a public, permissionless network, and are used to participate in and/or earned for participating in such network&rsquo;s consensus mechanism or otherwise used to maintain and/or earned for maintaining the technological operation and security of such network. We refer in this statement to these crypto assets as &ldquo;Covered Crypto Assets&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and their mining on proof-of-work networks as &ldquo;Protocol Mining.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<h2>Protocol Mining</h2>
<p>Networks rely upon cryptography and economic mechanism design to eliminate the need for designated trusted intermediaries to verify network transactions and provide settlement assurances to users. The operation of each network is governed by an underlying software protocol, consisting of computer code, that programmatically enforces certain network rules, technical requirements, and rewards distributions. Each protocol incorporates a &ldquo;consensus mechanism,&rdquo; or method for enabling the distributed network of unrelated computers (known as &ldquo;nodes&rdquo;) that maintain the peer-to-peer network to agree on the &ldquo;state,&rdquo; or authoritative record of network address ownership balances, transactions, smart contract code, and other data, of the network. Public, permissionless networks allow anyone to participate in the network&rsquo;s operation, including the validation of new transactions to the network in accordance with the network&rsquo;s consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Proof-of-work (&ldquo;PoW&rdquo;) is a consensus mechanism that incentivizes network transaction validation by rewarding network participants, called &ldquo;miners,&rdquo; who operate nodes adding computational resources to the network.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;PoW involves validating transactions on a network and adding them in blocks to the distributed ledger. The &ldquo;work&rdquo; in PoW is the computational resources that miners contribute to validate transactions and add new blocks to the network. Miners do not have to own the network&rsquo;s Covered Crypto Asset to validate transactions.</p>
<p>Miners use computers to solve complex mathematical equations in the form of cryptographic puzzles. Miners compete with their peers to solve these puzzles, and the first miner to solve a puzzle is tasked with accepting batches of transactions from other nodes and validating (or proposing) new blocks of transactions to the network. In exchange for providing validation services, miners earn &ldquo;Rewards&rdquo; in the form of newly &ldquo;minted&rdquo; or created Covered Crypto Assets that are delivered under the terms of the protocol.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;In this way, PoW creates an incentive for miners to invest the resources necessary to add valid blocks to the network.</p>
<p>A miner providing validation services receives the Reward only after the other nodes in the network verify, through the protocol, that the solution is correct and valid. To this end, once a miner finds the correct solution, it broadcasts this information to other miners who can verify whether the miner properly solved the puzzle to receive the Reward. Once verified, all miners then add the new block to their own copies of the network. PoW is designed to secure the network by requiring miners to spend considerable time and computational resources to authenticate transactions. When the validation process functions in this way, it not only makes it less likely that someone would seek to undermine a network but also makes it less likely that miners could include altered transactions, such as those enabling the &ldquo;double spending&rdquo; of Covered Crypto Assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In addition to self (or solo) mining, miners can join &ldquo;mining pools,&rdquo; which allow miners to combine their computational resources to increase their chances of successfully validating transactions and mining new blocks on the network. Mining pools have developed into various types, each with differing methods of operation and Reward distribution.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;A pool operator typically is responsible for coordinating the miners&rsquo; computational resources, maintaining the pool&rsquo;s mining hardware and software, overseeing the pool&rsquo;s security measures to protect against theft and cyberattacks, and ensuring that the miners are paid their Rewards. In return, the pool operator charges a fee that is deducted from the miners&rsquo; share of the Rewards earned by the mining pool. Reward payouts vary among pools, although Rewards often are distributed across the mining pool in proportion to the amount of computational resources that each miner contributes to the pool. Miners have no obligation to stay in a pool and can choose to leave a pool at any time.</p>
<h2>Division&rsquo;s View on Protocol Mining Activities</h2>
<p>It is the Division&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;Mining Activities&rdquo; (defined in this statement) in connection with Protocol Mining, under the circumstances described in this statement, do not involve the offer and sale of securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) and Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, it is the Division&rsquo;s view that participants in Mining Activities do not need to register transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act or fall within one of the Securities Act&rsquo;s exemptions from registration in connection with these Mining Activities.</p>
<h2>Protocol Mining Activities Covered by this Statement</h2>
<p>The Division&rsquo;s view pertains to the following Protocol Mining activities and transactions (&ldquo;Mining Activities&rdquo; and each a &ldquo;Mining Activity&rdquo;): (1) mining Covered Crypto Assets on a PoW network; and (2) the roles of mining pools and pool operators involved in the Protocol Mining process, including their roles in connection with the earning and distribution of Rewards. Only Mining Activities undertaken in connection with the following types of Protocol Mining are addressed in this statement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self (or Solo) Mining, which involves a miner mining Covered Crypto Assets using its own computational resources. The miner may work alone or together with others to operate a node and mine Covered Crypto Assets.</li>
<li>Mining Pool, which involves miners combining their computational resources with other miners to increase their chances of successfully validating transactions and mining new blocks on the network. Reward payments may flow from the network directly to the miners or indirectly to them through the pool operator.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act each defines the term &ldquo;security&rdquo; by providing a list of various financial instruments, including &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; &ldquo;note,&rdquo; and &ldquo;bond.&rdquo; Because a Covered Crypto Asset does not constitute any of the financial instruments that are specifically enumerated in the definition of &ldquo;security,&rdquo; we conduct our analysis of certain transactions involving Covered Crypto Assets in the context of Protocol Mining under the &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; test set forth in&nbsp;<em>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.</em><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The &ldquo;<em>Howey test</em>&rdquo; is used to analyze arrangements or instruments not listed in those statutory sections based on their &ldquo;economic realities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><a name="_Hlk190334973"></a></p>
<p>In evaluating the economic realities of a transaction, the test is whether there is an investment of money in an enterprise premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Federal courts since&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;have explained that&nbsp;<em>Howey&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;efforts of others&rdquo; requirement is satisfied when &ldquo;the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-certain-proof-work-mining-activities-032025?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<h3>Self (or Solo) Mining</h3>
<p>A miner&rsquo;s Self (or Solo) Mining is not undertaken with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Rather, a miner contributes its own computational resources, which secure the network and enable the miner to earn Rewards issued by the network in accordance with its software protocol. To earn Rewards, the miner&rsquo;s activities must comply with the rules of the protocol. By adding its computational resources to the network, the miner merely is engaging in an administrative or ministerial activity to secure the network, validate transactions and add new blocks, and receive Rewards. A miner&rsquo;s expectation to receive Rewards is not derived from any third party&rsquo;s managerial or entrepreneurial efforts upon which the network&rsquo;s success depends. Instead, the expected financial incentive from the protocol is derived from the administrative or ministerial act of Protocol Mining performed by the miner. As such, Rewards are payments to the miner in exchange for services it provides to the network rather than profits derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.</p>
<h3>Mining Pool</h3>
<p>Likewise, when a miner combines its computational resources with other miners to increase their chances of successfully mining new blocks on the network, the miner has no expectation of profit derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. By adding its own computational resources to a mining pool, the miner merely is engaging in an administrative or ministerial activity to secure the network, validate transactions and add new blocks, and receive Rewards. In addition, any expectation of profits that the miners have is not derived from the efforts of a third party, such as a pool operator. Even when participating in a mining pool, individual miners still perform the actual mining activity by contributing their computational power to solve the cryptographic puzzles for validation of new blocks. Moreover, whether a miner self (or solo) mines or mines as a member of a mining pool does not alter the nature of Protocol Mining for purposes of the&nbsp;<em>Howey</em>&nbsp;analysis. In either case, Protocol Mining, as described in this statement, remains an administrative or ministerial activity. Further, a pool operator&rsquo;s activities in operating the mining pool using the combined computational resources of participating miners primarily are administrative or ministerial in nature. While some of the pool operator&rsquo;s activities may benefit the group of miners, any such efforts are not sufficient to satisfy&nbsp;<em>Howey&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;efforts of others&rdquo; requirement because miners primarily are relying on the computational resources that they provide in conjunction with other members to the mining pool to earn profits. To this end, a miner does not join a mining pool based on the ability to earn profits passively from the activities of the pool operator.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange: Austrian "Aktienbarometer" 2025: Security Ownership In Austria Continues To Rise - Private Pension Provision Is Gaining In Importance: 30% Of Austrians Already Hold Securities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-austrian-aktienbarometer-2025-security-ownership-in-au-2025320/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vienna-stock-exchange-austrian-aktienbarometer-2025-security-ownership-in-au-2025320/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The latest survey of the "Aktienbarometer" &ndash; an annual survey carried out by the Federation of Austrian Industries, Aktienforum and Vienna Stock Exchange &ndash; shows a continuing upward trend in securities ownership among the Austrian population. Almost one in three Austrians now invests in shares, bonds or investment funds and ETFs. The growing importance of the capital market is reflected in the current figures and shows that long-term wealth accumulation has reached the centre of society.</p>
<p>According to the study conducted by Peter Hajek, a clear picture emerges: the Austrian population is increasingly focusing on securities as part of their private pension provision. In view of this, IV President Georg Knill emphasises: "Our business location is facing major challenges &ndash; our social security system is becoming ever more expensive and our national budget is under massive pressure. A strong capital market is essential &ndash; not only for the competitiveness of our location, but also for the security of our social system and thus for our prosperity", and continues: "The government programme is still somewhat vague with regard to the capital market &ndash; there is still room for development here in order to strengthen the domestic capital market and strengthen the framework conditions for those people who would like to make provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The importance of private pension provision is increasing significantly. Austria's pension system stands in stark contrast to capital market-orientated countries such as Denmark or the Netherlands. There are successful models there that show how it could work. "They ensure that long-term investments flow into the economy, innovations are financed and prosperity remains secure. Over 200 per cent of GDP is invested in funded pension plans there. Austria's figure is negligible at not even 7 per cent. This means that Austria has to spend a much higher proportion of its economic output on public pensions," says Angelika Sommer-Hemetsberger, President of the Aktienforum. " The capital market has the potential to complement and significantly reduce the financial burden on social security systems&rdquo;, adds CEO Christoph Boschan of the Vienna Stock Exchange. "Shares are the safest and most profitable asset class in the long term, as more and more people are realising. To forego these returns in the pension system would lead to a loss of income on the one hand and higher costs than in international comparison on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Key findings of the study</h3>
<ul class="list-normal">
<li>Significant increase in securities ownership: 30% of the domestic population in Austria now own securities (2.3 million).</li>
<li>In addition to long-term asset accumulation and value preservation, pension provision (57%) is increasingly coming to the fore.&nbsp;</li>
<li>1.4 million people who do not currently own securities are interested in acquiring them.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="BME" id="Contenido_Logo" src="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/images/Logos/bme/NotasPrensa/BME_ing.gif" /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div class="Texto">
<ul>
<li><span>It is the sixth company to register an Initial Access Document on the growth markets of BME market so yar this year</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Market Coordination and Listing Committee considers that&nbsp;<span>Simply Solar</span>&nbsp;will meet the requirements for listing on BME Scaleup. It is the sixth company to register an Initial Market Access Document (DIAM) on this BME market.</p>
<p>The company's Board of Directors has taken a reference price of 4.30 euros per share as a reference for the start of trading, which represents a total value of the company of 4.758.853 million euros.</p>
<p>The company's Registered Advisor is&nbsp;<span>Orbyn Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p><span>Simply Solar</span>, as a subsidiary of Praxia Energy, is specifically dedicated to the engineering and manufacturing of photovoltaic canopies for parking areas, communication antennas, and energy communities. It is focused on innovation and simplicity, with the goal of making solar energy more affordable.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Simply Solar</span>&nbsp;Information Document is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup website</a>, where you can find all the information about the company and its business.</p>
<p>The growth markets of BME (BME Growth and BME Scaleup) are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises. In 2024, these markets welcomed 23 new companies and now have more than 150 companies listed for trading.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx" target="_blank">BME Growth</a>&nbsp;allows small-cap companies from all sectors, with a significant presence of technology companies, to finance their growth, with recurring access to capital increases and a broad base of national and international investors. For its part,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx" target="_blank">BME Scaleup</a>&nbsp;is especially oriented towards scaleups, although it is also open to other types of companies such as SMEs, REITs, or family businesses. This market adapts to the needs of these companies by relaxing the incorporation requirements while offering the necessary transparency to investors. Among the advantages of accessing capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises are financing, reputation, visibility, a boost to inorganic growth, and greater ease in attracting and retaining talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these growth markets, BME completes its service offering. BME has a market for every type of company, from the first approaches to capital markets with the formation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entornopremercado.es/ing/Home">Pre-Market Environment</a>, to large companies listed on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The BME Ombudswoman Office Handled More Than 2,100 Queries In 2024, Up 6%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="BME" id="Contenido_Logo" src="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/images/Logos/bme/NotasPrensa/BME_ing.gif" /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div class="Texto">
<ul>
<li><span>95% of enquiries come from retail investors, with a slight increase in enquiries from issuers, market members and financial institutions.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The 6 closed takeover bids and several in process registered in 2024 generated an increase in enquiries about this type of transaction.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Once again, this year we received many requests for historical prices from individuals and institutions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME's Investor Protection Office has published its&nbsp;<span>2024 Annual Report</span>, which highlights an increase in investor advice and guidance activity. During the year, the Office handled 2,110 queries, 6% more than the previous year. The telephone channel continues to be the most used, followed by e-mail.</p>
<p>The growth in the Office's activity reflects the increased participation of retail investors in the market, driven by a greater interest in equities in a positive year in terms of returns, which saw a 25% increase in shareholder remuneration for Spanish listed companies.</p>
<p>The increase in takeover bids in 2024 also explains the rise in the number of enquiries from investors, who want to know the consequences of these operations and the rights of shareholders. BBVA's takeover bid for Banco Sabadell and Brookfield's takeover bid for Grifols have generated doubts among investors as they are still under study or have not yet been authorised.</p>
<p>Once again, this year, the voluntary deregistration of shares in the Book-Entry Register, possible options for avoiding the costs of holding delisted or suspended securities and warrants were also the subject of questions from investors, with a highlight this year being the voluntary deregistration for holders of shares in Seda de Barcelona (in liquidation).</p>
<p>Again, in 2024, there were many requests for historical prices of listed securities from entities and individuals who need such data for various uses and purposes, mainly taxation.</p>
<p>The report also focuses on the detection of fraud and phishing attempts, with cases of fake financial advisors contacting investors on behalf of BME. The Office recalls in its report that BME does not offer investment services or make commercial calls and therefore recommends that investors always verify the authenticity of the communications they receive.</p>
<p>In addition, the Office of the Investor Ombudsman has issued several recommendations to protect investors and improve market transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caution against fraud: do not answer calls or e-mails from supposed financial advisors without verifying where they are coming from.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Greater clarity in takeover bids: companies involved in takeover bids are urged to provide clear and accessible information to shareholders.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ease of renouncing excluded securities: streamlining procedures so that investors can avoid custody fees on illiquid securities and transparency in the execution of stock market orders, intermediaries are recommended to improve information on order execution, avoiding misunderstandings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;The Office is a safe and efficient channel for anyone interested to access information and clarify their doubts about the execution of transactions in the stock market, especially in the current context of growing investor interest,&rsquo; says Gloria Mart&iacute;nez-Picazo, BME's Investor Protection Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The full Annual Report is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/bme-exchange/docs/docsSubidos/Para-inversores/Protector-Inversor/Informe-Protectora-Inversor-2024.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;(only in spanish)</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you all for participating in the first installment of the CFTC&rsquo;s 2025 Leadership Speaker Series. I&rsquo;ve always believed one of the keys to continued success as an individual or as an organization is a commitment to life-long learning.</p>
<p>As a former intern and staffer at the CFTC, I was fortunate to participate in valuable professional development opportunities that enhanced both leadership skills and technical expertise that contribute to not only our shared CFTC mission, but also our professional acumen as individuals. I&rsquo;ve been working on this project for the past couple years and I&rsquo;m excited to launch this initiative to expand access to similar opportunities for staff now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to thank the Division of Administration and Shivon Kershaw for coordinating with my office over the last several months to make today&rsquo;s speaker series possible.</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of new technology is opening a new chapter in how our markets can function and how financial services firms do business. And it also has implications for the tools we use here at the CFTC to do our jobs. It is imperative for the CFTC to keep up with these developments in our markets and find ways to leverage new tools to continue to efficiently and effectively execute our mission.</p>
<p>We are so fortunate to be joined by Professor Sarah Hammer, Executive Director at the Wharton School, Academic Director and Adjunct Professor of University of Pennsylvania Law School and CEO of the Wharton Cypher Accelerator, which supports leading global businesses that are leveraging financial technology. Prof. Hammer has held many leadership roles in financial services and financial regulation&mdash;too many to name!&nbsp; But I do want to highlight a few.</p>
<p>Prof. Hammer was previously Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions and Director of the Office of Financial Institutions Policy at the US Department of the Treasury. In this role, she led the Department&rsquo;s policy responsibilities involving financial institutions, as well as oversaw the Federal Insurance Office and the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Compliance Policy.</p>
<p>She also was Managing Director of the Center for Innovation in Finance and Senior Director of the Alternative Investments Program at Wharton.&nbsp;From cybersecurity to digital assets to artificial intelligence, she is one of the preeminent thought leaders on the nexus of technology and innovation and the financial services sector.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of attending and participating in several of Prof. Hammer&rsquo;s presentations and I know today&rsquo;s discussion will be similarly engaging and insightful.</p>
<p>Thank you, Prof. Hammer, for sharing your time and expertise with the CFTC. And once again, thank you to all our staff for attending.</p>

<title>Global Financial Centres Index 37 - Confidence Returns While Leading Centres Are Stable</title>

<h4><strong>GFCI 37 Headlines</strong></h4>
<p>The 37th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 37) was published today by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.zyen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Z/Yen Group</a>&nbsp;in partnership with the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://en.cdi.org.cn/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">China Development Institute</a>&nbsp;(CDI).</p>
<ul>
<li>New York held onto the top position in the index and has now been in first place since GFCI 24, published in September 2018. </li>
<li>London remains in second place, and has closed the gap in the ratings with New York. Hong Kong retains third position ahead of Singapore. </li>
<li>San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, Shanghai, and Shenzhen are unchanged in fifth to ninth positions. Seoul re-entered the top 10 centres in this edition of the index. </li>
<li>There is little change in the ranking of the leading centres, with the top nine centres remaining unchanged. In the top 20 centres, Amsterdam rose nine places to 18th and Dubai rose four places to 12th position. </li>
<li>The average rating across all centres was up just over 2%, which suggests stronger confidence in the financial sector in this period. The largest increase in average ratings was in Eastern Europe &amp; Central Europe, at 2.48% and the lowest was in North America, where average ratings rose by 1.41%. </li>
<li>US centres showed the lowest improvement across the world regions, after a period of growth following the downturn caused by Covid-19. This may suggest lower confidence in US financial services performance moving forwards. </li>
<li>We have researched the key challenges facing international financial centres in the medium term. Geo-Political challenges are clearly seen as the most important risk, mentioned by 18% of respondents (lower than the 20% in GFCI 36). Competition from other centres and changing regional/national priorities were mentioned by 15% and 13% of respondents respectively. </li>
</ul>
<p>The top 20 centres in GFCI 37 are shown in the table below:</p>
<p><img alt="Top_20_GFCI37.original" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Top_20_GFCI37.original.jpg" title="Top_20_GFCI37.original" /></p>
<p>Full details of GFCI 37 can be found at&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.longfinance.net/programmes/financial-centre-futures/global-financial-centres-index/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.globalfinancialcentres.net</a>.</p>
<p><strong><i>Professor Michael Mainelli, Chairman of Z/Yen, said:<br />&ldquo;Confidence in leading international financial centres remains strong, with a high degree of stability in the rankings. That said, the index period of GFCI 37 falls outside the new US administration. A slow down in US centres may indicate some projected decoupling from global markets.&rdquo;</i></strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trustly, the global leader in Pay by Bank solutions, has announced that it will now support RIX INST, the instant settlement system of Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish Central Bank, solidifying Trustly&rsquo;s leading position in instant payouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representing an important milestone for the company in its home market, Trustly will be the first third-party provider to support RIX INST-powered instant payouts and will now offer instant payout coverage for all Swedish banks and their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move is also a significant development for the broader Swedish payments ecosystem, removing barriers to offer merchants instant withdrawals and simplify payouts for users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merchants can now instantly refund and pay out to customers of leading Swedish banks &ndash; including ICA Banken, L&auml;nsf&ouml;rs&auml;kringar, and Skandiabanken &ndash; while the change will also be a seamless experience for Trustly&rsquo;s merchants, with no API changes required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This latest enhancement to Trustly&rsquo;s offering will be rolled out initially for its iGaming customers before expanding to other verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Johan Tj&auml;rnberg, Group CEO of Trustly</b>, commented: &ldquo;This marks a significant milestone for Trustly and the Swedish payments ecosystem. Offering instant payouts has always been the core of what Trustly does, with our services already supporting broader schemes such as SEPA Inst across the Eurozone as well as local schemes such Straksoverf&oslash;rsel in Denmark. By now supporting RIX-INST, we have closed the final gaps in instant payouts in our home market, ensuring a faster and more reliable payment experience for businesses and consumers alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement follows the news earlier this year that Trustly-owned Ecospend retained the UK&rsquo;s most significant open banking contract to date with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, March 2025</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 19 March 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 8&ndash;1 to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. One member preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%.</p>
<p>As the Committee noted in February, there has been substantial progress on disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. That progress has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty has intensified, and the United States has made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments have responded. Other geopolitical uncertainties have also increased and indicators of financial market volatility have risen globally. The German government has announced plans for significant reform to its fiscal rules.</p>
<p>While UK GDP growth estimates have been slightly stronger than expected at the time of the February Monetary Policy Report, business survey indicators generally continue to suggest weakness in growth and particularly in employment intentions. In recent quarters, subdued activity has been judged to reflect both demand and supply factors.</p>
<p>Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 3.0% in January from 2.5% in December, slightly higher than expected in the February Report. Domestic price and wage pressures are moderating, but remain somewhat elevated. Although global energy prices have fallen back recently, they remain higher than last year and CPI inflation is still projected to rise to around 3&frac34;% in 2025 Q3. While inflation is expected to fall back thereafter, the Committee will pay close attention to any consequent signs of more lasting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%.</p>
<p>Based on the Committee&rsquo;s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint is appropriate. Should there be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, this could push down on inflationary pressures, warranting a less restrictive path of Bank Rate. Should there be more constrained supply relative to demand and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation, this would warrant a relatively tighter monetary policy path.</p>
<p>The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 19 March 2025</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices.</p>
<h3>The international economy</h3>
<p>2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.5% in 2024 Q4, in line with the projection in the February Monetary Policy Report. Since the MPC&rsquo;s February meeting, there had been a further increase in geopolitical and global trade policy uncertainty, and it was likely that this elevated uncertainty would persist. The US administration had imposed tariffs on some goods imports from some of its trading partners, as well as on all steel and aluminium imports, to which some governments had responded with tariffs of their own.</p>
<p>3: The Committee judged that the consequent risks around the near-term outlook for activity in a number of advanced economies, including the United Kingdom, remained to the downside. The overall effect on UK inflation was less clear at present, and would depend on where other countries&rsquo; trade policies settled and how these transmitted through different economic channels, including exchange rates. The Committee noted that this was a rapidly evolving situation, which it would monitor closely and assess further in the May policy round.</p>
<p>4: Euro-area GDP growth had remained subdued, increasing by 0.2% in 2024 Q4, marginally higher than the February Report projection. The S&amp;P Global HCOB PMI composite output index had suggested a modest increase in activity at the start of the year. Looking ahead, the German government had announced plans for significant reform to its fiscal rules, including making way for sizeable increases in defence and infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>5: US GDP had increased by 0.6% in 2024 Q4, in line with the February Report projection. Going forward, growth was expected to slow on the back of tariff and wider policy uncertainty, among other factors. Indicators of activity for 2025 Q1 suggested a weakening in household consumption growth and consumer confidence, while some surveys of firms&rsquo; output and investment expectations had also fallen in February.</p>
<p>6: In China, GDP had grown by 1.6% in 2024 Q4, and the government had set an annual growth target of around 5% for 2025. Growth was expected to slow in Q1 as the impact of past policy stimulus was fading. The imposition of tariffs by the US posed a downside risk to activity this year, although this could be somewhat ameliorated by the further fiscal stimulus announced in March.</p>
<p>7: The euro-area labour market had remained somewhat tight but had continued to normalise, while the labour market in the United States had remained close to balance. Unemployment in these regions remained at or near historical lows, and indicators of pay growth had generally been cooling.</p>
<p>8: Annual headline consumer price inflation had decreased slightly in the euro area and the United States, owing largely to base effects. In the euro area, twelve-month HICP inflation had decreased to 2.3% in February, while core inflation had also fallen slightly to 2.6%. In the United States, PCE inflation had fallen slightly to 2.5% in January, and core PCE inflation had fallen to 2.6%. Services price inflation remained somewhat elevated in both economies. Some measures of short and medium-term household inflation expectations in the United States had risen, possibly reflecting the impact of anticipated tariffs.</p>
<p>9: Since the MPC&rsquo;s February meeting, negotiations around a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, and the consequent possible prospect of a boost in global gas and oil supply, had contributed to declines in wholesale energy prices, although they had remained higher than last year. European wholesale near-term gas futures prices had fallen since the previous meeting by around 20%, with the potential relaxation of winter storage targets and a surge in liquefied natural gas imports also playing a role. Brent crude spot prices had fallen by 7%, to $71 per barrel, which was additionally reflective of the announced increased in OPEC+ supply from April, as well as weakening US economic activity and uncertainty around trade policies.</p>
<h3>Monetary and financial conditions</h3>
<p>10: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, financial market volatility had risen globally, reflecting an intensification of geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty.</p>
<p>11: There had been contrasting financial market developments across jurisdictions since the February MPC meeting. In the United States, government bond yields were lower, the dollar had depreciated, and equity prices were notably lower, having fallen by around 10% over the past month. Market contacts had noted that these movements in part reflected the impact of policy uncertainty on the US economic growth outlook. In contrast, in the euro area, government bond yields had increased sharply, driven by significant news on more expansionary German fiscal policy. On 5 March, German ten-year government bond yields had risen by around 30 basis points, the largest one-day move in over 30 years. The euro exchange rate had appreciated and euro-area equity prices, while volatile, had risen on balance.</p>
<p>12: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, the market-implied path for policy rates had fallen in the United States and had risen in the euro area. Nonetheless, expected policy rates over the next three years remained materially higher in the United States than in the euro area. At its meeting on 6 March, the ECB Governing Council had announced a 25 basis point reduction in its deposit facility rate to 2.5%, in line with market expectations. At its meeting ending on 19 March, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Federal Open Market Committee was expected to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, at 4.25% to 4.5%.</p>
<p>13: Overall, since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, financial market movements in the United Kingdom had been affected by global developments but had been smaller than in the United States and the euro area. Gilt yields had risen, there had been some appreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate and UK equity prices were on balance little changed. Market contacts continued to highlight two-sided risks to the UK macroeconomic outlook. The median respondent to the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS) expected CPI inflation to peak at around 3.5% in Q3 this year, an increase relative to expectations in the previous survey. Respondents continued to expect inflation to be at the 2% target at the three-year horizon. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures.</p>
<p>14: Market expectations were for Bank Rate to remain unchanged at this meeting. Thereafter, the median MaPS respondent expected a further 75 basis points of Bank Rate cuts this year. Market contacts emphasised elevated economic uncertainty, with perceptions that the near-term distribution for Bank Rate was skewed towards fewer cuts. Consistent with that, the path for Bank Rate implied by market pricing was somewhat higher than for the median MaPS respondent, declining by a little over 50 basis points over the rest of the year.</p>
<p>15: Pass-through from the relevant risk-free reference rates to saving and borrowing rates facing households and corporates had remained broadly in line with historical experience. The main exception had been household sight deposit rates, which had fallen by less and more slowly than Bank Rate since August, although these rates had not risen by as much as Bank Rate during the recent tightening cycle.</p>
<p>16: The average rate paid on the stock of floating rate mortgages had fallen since Bank Rate was first cut in August last year, reflecting full pass through at a pace in line with previous experience. But the average rate paid on the stock of fixed rate mortgages had risen as the majority of fixed term mortgages refinanced at higher rates. Overall, that meant the average rate paid on the total stock of all outstanding mortgages had continued to rise, albeit at a decreasing rate. An increasing proportion of households were choosing to borrow over longer terms, which reduced monthly capital repayments in the near term but meant they would have more debt to service further out.</p>
<p>17: House prices and mortgage lending had continued to recover in recent months. Market contacts noted that part of that rise might reflect a bringing forward of house purchases ahead of increases to Stamp Duty Land Tax due to take effect from April. House purchase mortgage approvals had remained broadly flat since last August at relatively robust levels.</p>
<p>18: There had been a relatively large increase in aggregate sterling broad money in January, driven by the volatile Non-Intermediary Other Financial Companies sector as well as inflows into the household and private non-financial company sectors. Given the volatility in near-term money data, lower-frequency trends typically provided a more reliable cross-check on the outlook. The ratio of broad money to nominal GDP had continued to drift down to around its end-2019 level, and was slightly below the level implied by the extrapolation of its trend between 2012 and 2019.</p>
<h3>Demand and output</h3>
<p>19: UK GDP had risen by 0.1% in 2024 Q4, above the -0.1% rate that had been expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. Quarterly growth had been supported by a 0.4% increase in monthly GDP in December. That in turn had been accounted for by a pickup in business-to-business services activity. The level of GDP had fallen back by 0.1% on the month in January, largely reflecting weakness in manufacturing output.</p>
<p>20: Reflecting the higher starting point to the level of 2025 Q1 GDP, Bank staff now expected around &frac14;% growth in 2025 Q1, higher than the 0.1% that had been incorporated in the February Report. This nowcast was, however, somewhat stronger than the combined steer from business surveys, of 0.0 to 0.1%, that was probably more representative of the underlying rate of growth. The S&amp;P Global UK composite PMI output index had stabilised at just over 50 in recent months, although recent CBI output series had been somewhat weaker. The Bank&rsquo;s Agents had reported that activity remained subdued, with weak consumer and business sentiment perceived as the main barrier to growth.</p>
<p>21: The Committee discussed the broader narrative behind recent weakness in activity. Official GDP data had been volatile over the past couple of years, but a slowing in growth was apparent on both headline GDP and other indicator-based underlying metrics towards the end of last year. As the Committee had considered in detail at its previous meeting, this was likely to reflect both weaker supply and a shortfall of demand relative to that weaker supply. Economic uncertainties, both globally and domestically, had risen recently. The data also suggested that monetary policy was continuing to weigh on activity, with slower growth in those industries that were more sensitive to interest rates. Intelligence from both the Decision Maker Panel survey and the Agents had pointed to a number of additional factors, including employment costs and global uncertainties, that continued to restrain firms&rsquo; investment decisions. The household saving ratio had remained elevated.</p>
<p>22: The Chancellor would announce the Spring Statement on 26 March, alongside an updated economic and fiscal forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>
<h3>Supply, costs and prices</h3>
<p>23: Quality issues with the official labour market data continued to be an area of concern for the MPC. Low achieved sample sizes and very low response rates meant that Labour Force Survey (LFS)-based estimates of labour market dynamics remained subject to considerable uncertainties, which increased the challenge of gauging the underlying state of labour market activity. The MPC had, for some time, utilised a wide range of information beyond official data to inform its judgements on the labour market, including business surveys and intelligence from the Bank&rsquo;s Agents.</p>
<p>24: A range of early-stage and more timely indicators of labour market dynamics, typically those reflecting labour demand and firms&rsquo; hiring decisions, had weakened in recent months to varying degrees. Some indicators, such as the S&amp;P Global UK PMI composite employment and REC Report on Jobs permanent staff placements indices, had deteriorated markedly to levels consistent with shrinking employment. Other indicators had not weakened to the same extent. The volume of vacancies over recent months had been broadly flat at similar levels to 2019 Q4. The three-month rolling average of HMRC payroll estimates of inflows to employee jobs had remained below its level in early 2024, whereas estimates of outflows had been relatively stable over the same period.</p>
<p>25: The overall weakening in these early-stage indicators suggested that some modest deterioration in late-stage indicators, such as redundancy and unemployment rates, should be expected over the coming months. The latest intelligence from the Agents suggested that employment intentions had weakened, on balance, and more firms had reported hiring pauses or freezes. These contacts had said that they would review staffing levels through natural attrition or redundancies if the outlook did not improve. The rolling three-month average of HR1 redundancy notifications, a leading indicator of actual redundancies, had remained, on average, at its historical norm in recent months.</p>
<p>26: Measures of labour market tightness had continued to ease slightly. The vacancies to unemployment ratio had remained around Bank staff&rsquo;s estimate of its equilibrium level. The latest intelligence from the Agents&rsquo; contacts suggested that recruitment difficulties had normalised. Such developments pointed to a labour market that was broadly in balance.</p>
<p>27: The LFS estimate of employment growth in the three months to January had been stronger than expected in the February Monetary Policy Report. The collective steer from business surveys, HMRC payroll data and the Agents&rsquo; employment intention scores pointed to underlying quarterly employment growth of 0.1% in 2025 Q1, broadly consistent with expectations at the time of the February Report. This was below population growth of around &frac14;%.</p>
<p>28: A broad set of indicators suggested that underlying pay growth had eased further in recent months, albeit to a still elevated level and above what could be explained by economic fundamentals. This softening in underlying pay growth contrasted with annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE), which had picked up to 6.1% in the three months to January from 4.9% in the three months to September. Bank staff analysis suggested that compositional effects, reflecting changes in the sectoral and full-time mix of employees, had accounted for only some of this increase in AWE growth. It also appeared that some sectors with historically volatile pay growth had accounted for the increase in AWE growth in 2024 Q4. Downweighting these volatile sectors brought the AWE measure more into line with Bank staff&rsquo;s estimate of underlying pay growth.</p>
<p>29: The MPC noted that in February the ONS had announced that in a forthcoming release it would open up revisions to the AWE data over a longer back run than the usual revision to the preceding month&rsquo;s estimate, to allow for late and updated returns from one business to be included.</p>
<p>30: The latest pay settlements and pay expectations data had been consistent with the February Report projection for pay growth to ease over the course of this year. Data from the Bank&rsquo;s and Brightmine&rsquo;s settlements databases suggested that the median rate of pay awards had remained at around 3 to 4% in the three months to February, although these estimates had been based on relatively small sample sizes. The latest intelligence from the Agents suggested average pay rises for 2025 of 3.5% to 4%, consistent with the average of 3.7% reported in the Agents&rsquo; annual pay survey conducted ahead of the February Report. The latest Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey had reported that businesses&rsquo; pay growth expectations for the year ahead had remained at 3.9% in the three months to February. The MPC continued to monitor closely the flow of pay settlements information and other data that would provide signals for the future path of pay growth.</p>
<p>31: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.0% in January from 2.5% in December. This was slightly higher than had been forecast at the time of the February Report, reflecting upside news to core goods and food prices. Core CPI inflation had also increased, to 3.7%, in line with expectations at the time of the February Report.</p>
<p>32: Core consumer goods price inflation had risen to 1.6% in January, alongside a material increase in food consumer price inflation, to 3.3%. Alongside external shocks, it was possible that domestic factors, such as labour costs, had been a driver of the recent pickup in core consumer goods and food prices. Additionally, the Agents had reported that some of their contacts had passed on costs associated with the Extended Producer Responsibility for packaging regulations, which were due to be finalised in July. The Agents&rsquo; contacts had indicated that there could be additional pass-through from these costs in the second half of this year. In addition, there had been some pockets of strength in certain commodity prices, such as cocoa and coffee, which appeared to have had a significant impact on food inflation.</p>
<p>33: Services price inflation had risen from 4.4% in December to 5.0% in January. This increase was, however, somewhat weaker than had been expected at the time of the February Report. Underlying services price inflation had remained elevated across a broad range of measures, regardless of whether they were based on exclusionary, trimming or reweighting approaches. While these had been on a downward trajectory through 2024, there had been little change in annual underlying services price inflation between December and January. Measures of underlying services inflation would probably reflect some of the pass-through from the forthcoming increase in employers National Insurance contributions, requiring some caution in their interpretation over coming months.</p>
<p>34: CPI inflation was expected to rise further in the near term, to around 3&frac34;% in 2025 Q3. This expectation was little changed from the projection made at the time of the February Report. Upside news to non-energy consumer goods prices had been offset by downside news to energy prices from downward moves in sterling oil and gas price curves relative to the assumptions in the February Report projection.</p>
<p>35: Indicators of households&rsquo; short- and medium-term inflation expectations had continued to rise in the latest data. The Citi/YouGov measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had risen to 3.9% in February, while the Bank/Ipsos measure had risen to 3.4%. This compared to pre-pandemic averages of 2.5% and 3.0% respectively. These increases could be broadly explained by households responding to actual inflation and in particular salient prices, such as food and energy, but they nevertheless represented an upside risk to future pay and inflation dynamics. Medium-term measures from these surveys had risen to similar levels and these had been a little above what could be explained by observed moves in the equivalent short-term measures.</p>
<p>36: Businesses&rsquo; inflation expectations had also risen, with the DMP reporting that businesses&rsquo; own price year-ahead inflation expectations had increased by 0.5 percentage points over the past six months, to 4.0% in the three months to February. This had left firms&rsquo; own-price inflation expectations marginally higher than own-price inflation realisations, which suggested firms no longer expected their own-price inflation rate to fall over the year ahead. The latest Consensus Economics survey of professional forecasters had reported an increase in the peak of the mean UK inflation forecast, to 3.7% in September 2025 up from 3.2% in the February survey.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>37: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>38: Since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, global trade policy uncertainty had intensified, and the United States had made a range of tariff announcements, to which some governments had responded. Other geopolitical uncertainties had also increased and indicators of financial market volatility had risen globally. The German government had announced plans for significant reform to its fiscal rules. The MPC would continue to assess global developments closely.</p>
<p>39: The Committee considered domestic economic developments and how these informed the assessment that progress on disinflation was continuing. The news since the previous MPC meeting had been mixed and, taken together, broadly in line with expectations at the time of the February Monetary Policy Report.</p>
<p>40: The Committee stressed the importance for policy making of high quality and reliable official data across the full range of economic and labour market statistics.</p>
<p>41: While UK GDP growth estimates had been slightly stronger than expected at the time of the February Report, business survey indicators generally continued to suggest weakness in growth. In recent quarters, subdued activity had been judged to reflect both demand and supply factors.</p>
<p>42: The labour market had continued to ease, although it was still judged to be broadly in balance. Some indicators of employment intentions had deteriorated markedly, to levels consistent with shrinking employment. Other indicators, such as the number of vacancies, had not weakened to the same extent. The Committee was continuing to monitor the response of employers to increases in their costs and to the subdued level of activity.</p>
<p>43: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.0% in January from 2.5% in December, slightly higher than had been expected in the February Report. This had reflected upside news in core consumer goods and food prices, which had more than offset slight downside news in services prices. Alongside external shocks, it was possible that domestic factors, such as labour costs, had been a driver of the recent pickup in non-energy goods prices.</p>
<p>44: Domestic price and wage pressures were moderating, but remained somewhat elevated. A broad range of measures had pointed to little change in underlying annual services price inflation between December and January. A range of indicators suggested that underlying pay growth had eased further in recent months, although annual growth in private sector regular average weekly earnings had picked up to 6.1% in the three months to January.</p>
<p>45: The latest wage settlements and pay expectations data had continued to suggest an easing in pay growth over the course of this year. The Committee would be monitoring incoming settlements data closely as they became available on a more comprehensive basis later in the year. More generally, the future trajectory of pay growth, relative to the likely path of productivity growth in the economy, would be an important determinant of the Committee&rsquo;s views on the persistence of domestic inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>46: Household inflation expectations had risen in recent months, at both short and medium-term horizons. Businesses&rsquo; inflation expectations had also risen, with the Decision Maker Panel survey reporting that businesses&rsquo; own price year-ahead inflation expectations had increased over the past six months. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures.</p>
<p>47: Although global energy prices had fallen back recently, they remained higher than last year and CPI inflation was still projected to rise to around 3&frac34;% in 2025 Q3. While inflation was expected to fall back thereafter, the Committee would pay close attention to any consequent signs of more lasting inflationary pressures. Monetary policy would act to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations were anchored at the 2% target.</p>
<p>48: Since last summer, and as set out in Box A in the November Report, the Committee&rsquo;s policy deliberations had been supported by the consideration of three cases that could affect the evolution of inflation persistence.&nbsp;These cases had focused on the uncertainties around domestic price and wage-setting behaviour, as the succession of very large external cost shocks in 2021&ndash;22 unwound and as headline CPI inflation returned close to the 2% target last year. These cases would change as the economy evolved and new shocks emerged.</p>
<p>49: Ahead of the May Report, the Committee was likely to consider scenarios for the risks around medium-term inflation, building on its recent deliberations. The MPC was currently focused on two particular risks. First, the extent to which there could be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply in the economy, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically, which could push down on inflationary pressures in the medium term. Second, the extent to which there could be more persistence in domestic wage and prices, both from more constrained supply relative to demand and from additional second-round effects related to the projected near-term increase in CPI inflation. The MPC would review the evidence on the impact and likelihood of these broad risks as a part of its May policy round, alongside its baseline forecast.</p>
<p>50: At this meeting, eight members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.5%. The Committee had noted in February that progress on disinflation in domestic prices and wages had generally continued. There had been relatively little news since the previous meeting from UK economic developments, notwithstanding the intensification in global uncertainties, and there continued to be a range of views underlying these members&rsquo; outlooks for the economy and inflation. There remained two-sided risks around the balance of supply and demand, and the persistence of domestic price and wage pressures. The underlying disinflationary process was expected to continue, but an accumulation of evidence would be used to assess progress. There was no presumption that monetary policy was on a pre-set path over the next few meetings.</p>
<p>51: One member preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate, to 4.25%.&nbsp;While global price developments had continued to pose risks for some time, disaggregated data pointed to inflation continuing to decline through both wage and price-setting channels. The earlier concerns of an asymmetry in the inflation process on the way down compared to the way up had not materialised, as goods disinflation had generally been passed through to consumers. The subdued outlook for demand remained consistent with services inflation normalising sustainably to target over the medium term. The setting of Bank Rate needed to account for policy transmission and the risks to supply capacity from a prolonged period of monetary restrictiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>52: Based on the Committee&rsquo;s evolving view of the medium-term outlook for inflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint was appropriate. Should there be greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, this could push down on inflationary pressures, warranting a less restrictive path of Bank Rate. Should there be more constrained supply relative to demand and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation, this would warrant a relatively tighter monetary policy path.</p>
<p>53: The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence might reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
<p>54: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>55: Eight members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann, Huw Pill, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted in favour of the proposition. Swati Dhingra voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>56: On 19 March, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;623 billion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that it will launch a second BrokerTec central limit order book (CLOB) for cash U.S. Treasuries in Q3 2025. In an industry-first, the new CLOB will be co-located in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>&nbsp;next to CME Group's deeply liquid U.S. Treasury futures and options markets to support trading between cash and derivatives markets.</p>
<p>"As clients navigate this period of heightened uncertainty and record debt issuance, U.S. Treasury spread trading continues to drive price discovery and liquidity across cash, futures and repo markets," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Mike Dennis</span>, Global Head of Fixed Income, CME Group. "By launching a new trading venue, we will bring the full U.S. Treasury ecosystem closer together, delivering simplicity and efficiency for global market participants."</p>
<p>"Until now, clients have had to manage the intricacies of deploying relative value strategies between&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">New York</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>&nbsp;markets, which can lead to legging risk," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">John Edwards</span>, Global Head of BrokerTec. "Our new CLOB will greatly enhance the client experience for cash versus futures strategies. By allowing smaller notional sizes and adjusting minimum price increments, it will also enable smaller firms to participate in spread trading, broadening and deepening the liquidity pool and increasing matching opportunities."</p>
<p>BrokerTec's existing&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">New York</span>-based CLOB will remain its primary venue for price discovery in cash U.S. Treasuries, with&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">February 2025</span>&nbsp;average daily notional volume (ADNV) of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$113 billion</span>. The second Chicago CLOB, operated by BrokerTec Americas LLC, will complement this offering by focusing on relative value strategies. Clients will be able to trade all seven of BrokerTec's on-the-run<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4387591-1&amp;h=3723775323&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2Fmarkets%2Fbrokertec%2Fbrokertec-us-treasuries.html&amp;a=%C2%A0benchmark+U.S.+Treasuries" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;benchmark U.S. Treasuries</a>&nbsp;in smaller notional sizes to align with the futures market, and at tighter price increments of 1/16th of a 32nd, to allow for more precise hedging.</p>
<p>Available on Globex, the new venue leverages the existing BrokerTec API and can be accessed via clients' existing CME Group connectivity. It will be available for client testing beginning on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">April 27</span>, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BrokerTec is a leading marketplace for benchmark cash U.S. Treasuries and U.S. and EU repo transactions. On&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 3, 2025</span>, it set an all-time single-day volume record of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.05 trillion</span>&nbsp;in ADNV traded across its dealer-to-dealer CLOB, dealer-to-client request-for-quote, and streaming platforms.</p>
<p>CME Group's U.S. Treasury futures and options hit an all-time daily volume record on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">February 25</span>, with 40,664,890 contracts traded.&nbsp;</p>

<title>LME Response To UK Financial Conduct Authority Final Notice</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-response-to-uk-financial-conduct-authority-final-notice-2025320/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-response-to-uk-financial-conduct-authority-final-notice-2025320/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="large-text">The London Metal Exchange (LME) notes the FCA&rsquo;s announcement today and acknowledges the findings in respect of its systems and controls. It accepts that, in March 2022, once the effects of large over-the-counter (OTC) positions had spilled over onto the LME&rsquo;s nickel market, the LME price rose more quickly than would have been the case if certain LME systems and controls had acted as a better line of defence to the effects on the LME's market of the OTC disorder.</p>
<p>The LME also welcomes the FCA&rsquo;s recognition of the fact that very large positions held on the OTC market were the principal driver of the extraordinary speed and extent of the price rises at the height of the nickel market events, and that the LME did not have visibility of the OTC positions at the time.</p>
<p>Since March 2022, significant work by both the LME and the FCA has materially reduced the risks of such an event from occurring again.</p>
<p>Firstly, in respect of the on-exchange market, the LME has implemented improvements to its control frameworks and processes, including the introduction of daily price limits. And while there is no finding by the FCA that the specific controls (including price bands) were capable of preventing the underlying market disorder of March 2022, the LME is confident that its enhanced controls and processes now in place further bolster the resilience of its markets.</p>
<p>Secondly, in respect of the OTC market, the LME welcomes the FCA&rsquo;s recently published Policy Statement 25/1 (PS25/1) on reforming the commodity derivatives regulatory framework, and in particular the FCA&rsquo;s acknowledgment that the LME could not fully assess risks in March 2022 because of a lack of visibility of OTC positions. PS25/1 provides valuable regulatory support for the LME&rsquo;s own weekly OTC position reporting, which the LME felt it necessary to mandate after March 2022. PS25/1 also notes the FCA&rsquo;s important power under Regulation 28 of the MiFI Regulations to intervene, including in OTC markets, where other tools are insufficient.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, commented: &ldquo;We take our responsibilities as a global market operator very seriously, and acknowledge that we could have provided a better line of defence to the effects of the disorder in the OTC market, which had spilled over onto the LME market in March 2022. The LME swiftly implemented market enhancements and we are pleased to be able to move forward, stronger as a result. In parallel we fully recognise the important work the FCA continues to undertake in strengthening oversight of the OTC market."</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<h4><span>OTC</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>OTC trades and associated margin calls take place outside of the LME market. They can, however, impact the LME market as OTC trades very often reference LME prices or may be hedged by positions taken on LME markets.</li>
<li>As acknowledged by the FCA, this interaction between off-market OTC trades and the LME market was the largest driver of price volatility between 4 and 8 March 2022. Information about the scale of these OTC positions and associated missed margin calls is contained in the Oliver Wyman Independent Review which was commissioned by the LME, which determined that, in the days leading up to 8 March 2022, over US$1billion of OTC client margin calls had not been paid.</li>
<li>The LME had previously consulted the market in 2021 on introducing additional requirements to report OTC positions to the LME, but had determined not to do so in light of concerns expressed by participants in response to the consultation that such additional requirements would duplicate similar obligations to report OTC positions to other bodies, including regulators.</li>
<li>After the events of March 2022, the LME introduced weekly OTC position reporting notwithstanding market objections. In PS25/1 the FCA now states that it is appropriate for trading venues to have access to such data.</li>
<li>PS25/1 also sets out further important actions which the FCA is taking in respect of oversight of the OTC market, and notes HMT&rsquo;s intended modifications to the FCA&rsquo;s existing powers to intervene as appropriate under Regulation 28 of the MiFID regulations. These changes would allow the FCA to intervene more effectively to require a market participant to reduce an OTC position, should it be considered necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Price bands</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>The LME accepts that its price bands (part of its overall systems and controls, being channels within which orders are admitted onto to exchange) could have acted as a more robust line of defence to the effects on the LME's market of the OTC disorder.</li>
<li>Historically, the LME operated its price bands primarily to guard against error trades and rogue algorithms. When the price bands appeared to be inhibiting movements in price resulting from intentional trades, the LME would adjust or suspend them, in order to prioritise market price discovery.</li>
<li>In respect of the events of March 2022, and given the presence of large OTC positions which were not visible to the LME, the LME&rsquo;s above approach to operating its price bands allowed the LME nickel price to rise more quickly than it would otherwise have done.</li>
<li>The LME is pleased to note there is no finding from the FCA that the price bands were capable of preventing the underlying market disorder in March 2022. Since March 2022, the LME has enhanced its controls including by the introduction of a daily price limit which means that LME prices cannot move by more than 12% (aluminium and copper) or 15% (all other physically settled metals).</li>

<title>First UK Financial Conduct Authority Enforcement Action And Fine Against A Recognised Investment Exchange</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/first-uk-financial-conduct-authority-enforcement-action-and-fine-against-a-recog-2025320/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has fined the London Metal Exchange (LME) &pound;9.2 million for failing to ensure its systems and controls were adequate to deal with severe market stress.</p>
<p>Between 4 and 8 March 2022, the price of LME&rsquo;s 3-month nickel futures contract encountered extreme volatility. This culminated in the early hours of 8 March 2022 when its price rose to over $100,000, more than double the closing price on 7 March 2022, with most of the rise occurring in little over an hour. These events undermined the orderliness of and confidence in LME&rsquo;s market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LME suspended its nickel market for 8 days and cancelled all nickel trades that took place on 8 March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LME&rsquo;s systems and controls were not adequate to ensure orderly trading under conditions of severe market stress. In particular, LME did not have adequate controls or policies relating to the operation of its automatic volatility controls, its &lsquo;price bands&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decisions about market orderliness could only be taken by designated senior managers, but LME&rsquo;s processes for escalating unusual or hazardous market conditions to those managers were inadequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During LME&rsquo;s &lsquo;Asian trading&rsquo; hours, from 1am to 7am GMT, only relatively junior trading operations staff were on duty. They had not been trained to recognise anything other than error trades or rogue algorithms as potential causes of a disorderly market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant that when price rises in the nickel contract became increasingly extreme during the early hours of 8 March it was not escalated to senior LME managers. Instead, trading operations staff took steps to accommodate the price rises, even disabling the price bands, during the most extreme period of volatility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LME&rsquo;s breaches allowed the price of its 3-month nickel futures contract to increase much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible. This increased the potential exposure of investors and market users to risks the price bands were designed to mitigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA acknowledges the work undertaken by LME since March 2022 to enhance and strengthen its controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA has delivered a focused enforcement outcome for this complex investigation, alongside the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps25-1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wider market reform to the commodity derivatives regulatory framework</a>&nbsp;brought forward in February 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'London&rsquo;s metal markets are of vital importance to the UK and global economy. We expect controls that match their significance. The LME should have been better prepared to address the serious risks posed by extreme volatility.'</p>
<p>This is the first enforcement action the FCA has taken against a UK recognised investment exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LME accepted the findings and so qualified for a 30% reduction in its financial penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA announced its investigation into LME on 3 March 2023 having considered there were exceptional circumstances to warrant doing so. This investigation was delivered significantly quicker than the average length for investigations closed in 2023/24.</p>

<p>2. The LME agreed to resolve the case at an early stage and qualified for a 30% discount on the penalty imposed. Without this discount the fine would have been &pound;13.2 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. See: FCA Press Release,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/update-our-public-statement-london-metal-exchange" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Update on our public statement on the London Metal Exchange</a>, 3 March 2023, updated 6 March 2023.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The size of the Malaysian capital market hit an all-time high of RM4.2 trillion in 2024 (2023: RM3.8 trillion), driven by the growth in stock market capitalisation and bonds and sukuk outstanding. </p>
<p>The assets under management (AUM) of the fund management industry reached a new high of RM1.1 trillion (2023: RM975.5 billion) - passing the RM1 trillion mark - on the back of strong global equity market performance, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) said in its Annual Report 2024 released today. </p>
<p>2024 also saw much higher fund-raising activities, growing to RM138.9 billion (2023: RM127.7 billion). These include a record 55 IPOs (2023: 32 IPOs), which raised a total of RM7.42 billion (2023: RM3.6 billion).<span style="font-size: 11px; text-indent: 0cm;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said the sustained growth, helped by robust bond and sukuk issuances, showed that the capital market remained resilient, and it continued to facilitate capital formation and help support the national economy. </p>
<p>Looking ahead, he said the SC is now drafting a new five-year capital market masterplan, focusing on key areas such as improving financial security for retirees and promoting sustainable financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Building on our market&rsquo;s strengths, the SC remains committed to fostering an inclusive and vibrant capital market, while facilitating innovation and enhancing regulatory efficiency,&rdquo; Dato&rsquo; Faiz said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>On receipt of his award,&nbsp;</span><b>Shreyangshu Deb (above),</b><span>&nbsp;top performing undergraduate student from</span><b>&nbsp;</b><span>Christ University, India said: &ldquo;</span><i>The journey to winning the CISI Educational Trust Global Awards 2025 in the undergraduate category has been an incredible learning experience. The first round's topic&mdash;'Analysing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Challenges in Finance'&mdash;introduced me to the rapid adoption of AI in the financial sector, an area I had not studied before. Researching AI's role in finance not only broadened my perspective but also made me realise its significance in shaping investment strategies and risk management. Now, I am more motivated than ever to upskill in this space. The final round required a good knowledge of current affairs&mdash;mostly on how geopolitics influences world economics and business decisions. This developed a sense of curiosity and enhanced my higher-order thinking skills. Moreover, interacting with a panel of seasoned professionals was an invaluable experience. I was initially in disbelief when the results named me the overall winner of this year's CISI Educational Trust Global Awards. Not only was it an achievement, but it also felt like a huge relief&mdash;my hard work had indeed paid off. I am deeply grateful to CISI for this opportunity, which marks a significant step forward in expanding my knowledge and expertise in the financial sector.</i></p>
<p class="signature365-3dp5j1zc"><b>Hamza Khalid (below)&nbsp;</b>from Queen Mary University, London, top performing postgraduate student, said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;I am honoured to be named the CISI Educational Trust Award Winner 2025 in the postgraduate category. I really appreciate the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment for creating this platform to explore the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence in Finance. As AI continues to reshape the financial landscape, understanding both its opportunities and challenges is crucial to ensuring its responsible and effective integration. This experience has enhanced my research, analytical, and problem-solving skills while deepening my understanding of AI&rsquo;s impact on finance. It has also strengthened my confidence as I prepare to take on a role in the industry.</i></p>
<p class="signature365-3dp5j1zc"><i><img alt="Hamza Khalid" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Hamza-Khalid.jpg" title="Hamza Khalid" /><br /></i></p>
<p class="signature365-3dp5j1zc"><i>&ldquo;I highly encourage fellow students to take advantage of CISI&rsquo;s wealth of resources and initiatives, which provide invaluable insights into AI and other critical areas of finance. The opportunity to learn, engage with industry experts, and gain new perspectives has been truly enriching. I am excited to take the next step in my career, applying these insights in the finance sector.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="signature365-3dp5j1zc"><b>Frank Moxon CF, Chartered FCSI(Hon)</b>&nbsp;Chair of the CISI Educational Trust, commented: &ldquo;<i>Well done to all of those who took part in the CISI Educational Trust Global Awards 2025, and especially to the prize winners.&nbsp; The level of entries was high, and the judges enjoyed meeting students from across the world, appreciated the hard work they had put into their presentations and were delighted to answer some interesting and pertinent questions.

<title>Puro.earth Reaches Major Milestone Of 1 Million Tonnes Of CO2 Removed - Puro.Earth Confirms 1,000,000 Issuances Of CO2 Removal Certificates (CORCs), Representing Equivalent Tonnes Of CO2 Removed From the Atmosphere</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Puro.earth, the leading carbon-crediting platform for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), today announced the issuance of over<sup>1</sup></span><span>1 million CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs) since its first issuance in 2019, representing 1 million tonnes of verified carbon removal.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Puro.earth&rsquo;s issuance of 1 million carbon credits underscores its role in accelerating the carbon removal market and evolving engineered carbon removals as a critical climate solution.<sup>2</sup></span><span>&nbsp;While it took nearly five years to reach 500,000 issued CORCs (Q1 2024), this number doubled one year later, hitting 1 million in Q1 2025. With issuance growing exponentially, Puro.earth is now on track to match this milestone again before the end of H1 2026.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;Reaching one million of CO₂ removals is just the beginning&mdash;our goal is to continue to use our expertise and track record to deliver proven, scalable and high-quality carbon removal credits. The next million is already within reach, and we will continue to ensure that businesses worldwide have access to trusted, verifiable carbon removal credits, at scale&rdquo;</i></span>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Jan-Willem Bode, President, Puro.earth</b>.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Of the first 1 million issuances, just over half of those (52.13%) have already been retired, meaning 576,561<sup>3</sup></span><span>&nbsp;metric tonnes of CO2&nbsp;have been claimed for.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Puro.earth&rsquo;s methodologies driving this milestone are Geologically Stored Carbon (GSC) (34.3% of issuances) &ndash; such as<b>&nbsp;</b>Direct Air Capture Carbon and Storage (DACCS) and Bio Energy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) &ndash; and Biochar (34.1%). Both methodologies have been popular with buyers as they offer scalable, high-impact solutions for carbon removal with well-defined processes and measurable outcomes.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The United States leads issuances by a significant margin, contributing to nearly half (45%) of the total issuances. This is a result of the strong presence of suppliers and carbon removal projects in that market. Following the U.S. are Finland (9.87%), Bolivia (9.64%), and Brazil (9.15%). Other European markets driving issuances include Austria, Norway, and the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Shifting buyer sentiment has been central to this growth. According to&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards" id="OWAed225871-60ca-54c6-f6b3-884efb8c48e3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CDR.fyi leaderboards</a>, Microsoft, Google, and Frontier Buyers have led in the development of the early-stage durable CDR market. Their leadership has been essential in de-risking CDR technologies and enabling suppliers to scale their operations. Future expansions of the market will require activating the next generation of buyers, which many expect to come from hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation, concrete, steel manufacturing, shipping, and chemical production. The market is already seeing increased interest from buyers in these sectors, such as a four-year,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.gigablue.co/news/gigablue-selects-puroearth-to-certify-marine-carbon-fixation-and-sequestration-methodology" id="OWAcf2708e7-bc9c-9c33-f92e-785b7d120657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">200,000 tonne transaction with SkiesFifty</a>&nbsp;and Gigablue &ndash; a Puro.earth supplier.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The achievement of 1 million issuances reflects the growing momentum in engineered carbon removals driven by Puro.earth and its suppliers, buyers, and partners, working together to build the market.&nbsp;<span><i>"We want to thank the key players that have come together to build the CDR market with us: the courageous investors who ventured into the unknown, the pioneering entrepreneurs who chose innovation over business-as-usual, and the forward-thinking buyers whose commitments make everything move,"&nbsp;</i></span>said&nbsp;<b>Antti Vihavainen, Vice Chairman, Puro.earth.</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;Puro.earth has been instrumental in accelerating the carbon removal market by providing a trusted platform for transparent and credible carbon removal credits at scale. Reaching this milestone is a testament to the growing momentum of durable carbon removal, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Puro.earth to scale impact even further with Climeworks Solutions&mdash;our portfolio of high-quality, permanent carbon removal offerings,&rdquo;</i></span>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Climeworks Chief Commercial Officer Adrian Siegrist.</b></div>

<title>SET, FETCO And EEF Launch Computer Donation Initiative For Underserved Schools On SET's 50th Anniversary</title>

<p><b><span>KEY POINTS</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SET, FETCO and EEF launch the &ldquo;Computers for Young Thai Financial Education&rdquo; initiative, calling for business sector participation.</b></li>
<li><b>This campaign targets donations of 5,000 computers with financial literacy package to underserved schools in five years, fostering early financial education among Thai youth.</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="firstmt-15">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has partnered with the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations (FETCO) and the Equitable Education Fund (EEF) Thailand to launch the <b>&ldquo;Computers for Young Thai Financial Education&rdquo;</b> initiative to bridge Thailand&rsquo;s educational divide and foster financial literacy among the nation&rsquo;s youth. This initiative is one of SET&rsquo;s three flagship social contribution programs under the <b>&ldquo;SET's 50th Anniversary: Social Impact Drive&rdquo;</b> campaign.</p>
<p><b>SET President Asadej Kongsiri</b> emphasized that the &ldquo;SET's 50th Anniversary: Social Impact Drive&rdquo; campaign underscores its dual commitment to capital market advancement and broader social development. &ldquo;Through the &ldquo;Computers for Young Thai Financial Education&rdquo; initiative, we are tackling Thailand's education gap while expanding young people&rsquo;s access to online self-learning resources. SET will mobilize business sector partners to achieve the five-year target of 5,000 computer donations and pre-load each computer with financial education package, creating a powerful learning tool that cultivates financial literacy and savings habits among students, educators and families,&rdquo; SET President added.</p>
<p><b>FETCO Vice Chairman Pichet Sithi-Amnuai </b>reaffirmed the capital market sector&rsquo;s strong commitment to this initiative. &ldquo;On behalf of the capital market organizations, FETCO fully supports this initiative which is considered a strategic investment in the nation's human capital. By providing both technology access and financial knowledge, we are equipping young people throughout Thailand with the digital literacy and financial acumen needed to thrive in our modern economy, empowering the next generation to emerge as key architects of the sustainable development of Thailand's capital markets and broader economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>EEF Managing Director </b><b>Dr. </b><b>Kraiyos Patrawart</b> highlighted that resource deficiencies in small and underserved schools in remote areas directly impact learning outcomes, with OECD research confirming that such schools typically produce lower PISA scores. EEF surveys conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic also show that underprivileged rural students primarily rely on parents' mobile phones for learning, with no access to tablets or computers&mdash;a technology gap ten times wider than for the general population. "Schools represent their only gateway to digital learning resources, which is why we focus on mobilizing cross-sector collaboration to create educational equity," said EEF Managing Director. "With our comprehensive information systems, we can accurately identify resource-deficient schools through participatory processes involving teachers, school administrators, the Network of Educational Management in Highland and Remote Areas, and the Office of Basic Education Commission (OBEC), creating transparent intervention mapping that will initially prioritize approximately 200 schools with the most urgent needs. This initiative will significantly narrow educational and digital divides affecting underserved schools in remote areas while promoting equitable resource and budget distribution, profoundly advancing EEF's commitment to sustainable educational development.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Default">Capital market organizations, businesses and interested parties are invited to contribute to this initiative in any of these three forms: 1) Donation of pre-owned computers in good working conditions, 2) Donation of new computers, or 3) In-kind support through expertise contribution.</p>
<p class="Default">For more information, please contact EEF Call Center at +66 (0) 2079 5475. The latest updates about this initiative&rsquo;s progress are available at <a href="http://www.eef.or.th/donate/">www.eef.or.th/donate/</a> and <a href="https://pinhelppoint.com/">https://pinhelppoint.com/</a></p>

<title>ASIC: Amendment To Regulation</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-amendment-to-regulation-2025320/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During a recent review ASIC identified a technical error in the application of indexation to certain company review fees since 2011.</p>
<p>The affected fees included late fees, 10-year upfront fees and special company review fees under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations (Review Fees) Regulations 2003</em>.</p>
<p>This review identified a discrepancy between the original policy intention of the regulations and the wording contained in the actual enacted regulations.</p>
<p>This discrepancy meant that while ASIC has been applying the fees as originally intended, they did not reflect the regulations.</p>
<p>The Government updated the regulations on Tuesday 12 March to reflect ASIC&rsquo;s application of the fees and the intended policy outcome.</p>
<p>Users of ASIC&rsquo;s services do not need to take any action because of this update.</p>

<p>ii. Catalist Rule 703(1)(a), read with Catalist Rule 302(6), by causing the Company to fail to promptly disclose the termination of a key cooperation agreement between&nbsp;PT Samantaka Batubara (&ldquo;<strong>PT SB</strong>&rdquo;), a principal subsidiary of the Company, and&nbsp;its cooperation partner,&nbsp;PT Global Energi Lestari (&ldquo;<strong>PT GEL</strong>&rdquo;), for the production and delivery of coal &nbsp;to PT SB&rsquo;s customers&nbsp;(the &ldquo;<strong>Termination</strong>&rdquo;), on or around 23 February 2023, a piece of material information known to the Company which was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the Company&rsquo;s securities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. In addition, SGX RegCo reprimands Mr. Andreas Rinaldi for breaching&nbsp;Catalist Rule 703(1)(a), read with Catalist Rule 302(6), by causing the Company to fail to promptly disclose the expiry of the Group&rsquo;s only coal mine concession in Indonesia on or around 25 February 2023, a piece of material information known to the Company which was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the Company&rsquo;s securities.</p>
<p>3. SGX RegCo also reprimands Mr. Suherman Budiono, the Chief Financial Officer (the &ldquo;<strong>CFO</strong>&rdquo;), for breaching&nbsp;Catalist Rule 703(1)(a), read with Catalist Rule 302(6), by causing the Company to fail to promptly disclose the Termination on or around 23 February 2023, a piece of material information known to the Company which was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the Company&rsquo;s securities.</p>
<p><strong>Details of the breaches</strong></p>
<p>4. The Group&rsquo;s principal activity is in the production and sale of coal. &nbsp;At the material time, PT SB held the mining rights to the Group&rsquo;s only coal mine concession in Indonesia&nbsp;(the &ldquo;<strong>Licence</strong>&rdquo;), which was due to expire on 25 February 2023.&nbsp; PT SB was the sole contributor to the Group&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>5. PT SB had a cooperation agreement with PT GEL, pursuant to which PT GEL was responsible for, among others, the coal production activities of PT SB and the delivery of coal from PT SB&rsquo;s stockpile to PT SB&rsquo;s customers.&nbsp;PT GEL was PT SB&rsquo;s only cooperation partner at the material time.</p>
<p>6. On 28 November 2022, PT SB served a notice of termination on PT GEL (the &ldquo;<strong>Termination Notice</strong>&rdquo;), with effect from 30 November 2022, on the grounds of non-fulfilment of obligations under the cooperation agreement by PT GEL.&nbsp; The Termination Notice was served by a director of PT SB (the &ldquo;<strong>Subsidiary Director</strong>&rdquo;), on behalf of PT SB, without any formal approval from nor notification to the Board.&nbsp; The Subsidiary Director also did not inform anyone about the Termination at this stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. As a result of the Termination and pending the entry of a definitive agreement with a new cooperation partner, PT SB was not able to continue with the production and delivery of any coal to its customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. In or around December 2022, the CFO was verbally informed by a production team member at PT SB that onsite operations appeared to have slowed down and that there had been little communication between PT SB and PT GEL, with no mining activities since November 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Noting that PT SB had failed to meet its operation target from month to month, and that the Subsidiary Director had stopped coming to the office since November 2022, the Company terminated the Subsidiary Director&rsquo;s service with effect from 31 December 2022.</p>
<p>10. Sometime in January 2023, the CFO met up with the Subsidiary Director to enquire about the status of the cooperation agreement between PT SB and PT GEL.&nbsp; The Subsidiary Director informed the CFO of the Termination and provided him with a copy of the Termination Notice.&nbsp; The CFO, however, did not inform anyone about the Termination at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;11. In or before February 2023, the CEO was aware of the impending expiry of the Licence on 25 February 2023 (the &ldquo;<strong>Licence Expiry</strong>&rdquo;), and the fact that the Licence had yet to be renewed.&nbsp; The CEO, however, did not inform the rest of the Board about the impending Licence Expiry at this stage.</p>
<p>12. On 23 February 2023, the Head of Compliance informed the Sponsor of, among others, the Termination after receiving a copy of the Termination Notice from the CFO.&nbsp; On the same day, the Sponsor informed the Board of the Termination via email and advised them to assess whether the Termination is considered material information for immediate disclosure.</p>
<p>13. Upon being notified of the Termination, the Board decided that an immediate announcement should be released.&nbsp; However, the Head of Compliance, who was responsible for drafting the announcement, was hospitalised for surgery on 24 February 2023. &nbsp;The announcement was only released on 1&nbsp;March 2023.</p>
<p>14. On 25 February 2023, the Licence expired.&nbsp; The Board (except the CEO) was still unaware of the Licence Expiry at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;15. On 1 March 2023, the Company released an announcement on SGXNET to disclose the Termination.&nbsp; The announcement stated, among others, that:</p>
<p>(a) &ldquo;<em>Shareholders should note that the production and delivery of coal from PT SB&rsquo;s coal mine to the customers will be dependent on when the agreement is being entered into between the new cooperation partner and PT SB&rdquo;;&nbsp;</em>and</p>
<p>(b) the &ldquo;<em>Directors are of the view that the Termination will have a material impact on the financial performance and position of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2022</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>16. On 8 March 2023, the CEO notified the rest of the Board of the Licence Expiry via email, upon which the Board decided to immediately announce the Licence Expiry.</p>
<p>17. On 9 March 2023, the Company released an announcement on SGXNET to disclose the Licence Expiry.&nbsp; The announcement stated, among others, that pending renewal of the Licence, &ldquo;<em>PT SB is currently halting its operational activities at the coal mine concession, and will not be delivering coal until approval for the Licence Renewal is obtained</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>18. To date, PT SB has not entered into a definitive agreement with any new cooperation partner or mining contractor to carry out the production and delivery of coal to PT SB&rsquo;s customers.&nbsp; Likewise, renewal of the Licence has yet to be obtained and operational activities at PT SB&rsquo;s coal mine concession remain halted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>19. Trading in the Company&rsquo;s securities has been suspended since 15 June 2023, and the Company has been placed under judicial management since 26 January 2024.</p>
<p><em><strong>First breach concerning Catalist Rule 719(1), read with Catalist Rule 302(6) &ndash; Causing the Company to fail to have in place adequate and effective systems of internal controls and risk management systems</strong></em></p>
<p>20. Catalist Rule 719(1) provides that &ldquo;[a]<em>n issuer should have adequate and effective systems of internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk management systems.&nbsp; The audit committee may commission an independent audit on internal controls and risk management systems for its assurance, or where it is not satisfied with the systems of internal controls and risk management.&nbsp; In arriving at the decision, the audit committee should consider the recommendation of the continuing sponsor&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>21. Paragraph 5.4 of Practice Note 7A on Continuing Disclosure additionally provides, among others, that the Company should put in place internal controls to escalate material information to the Board expediently for consideration.</p>
<p>22. In relation to the Termination, the Subsidiary Director exercised full authority to serve the Termination Notice on behalf of PT SB, which effectively terminated a material contractual arrangement of the Group that had a material impact on the financial performance and position of the Group.&nbsp; In particular, the Subsidiary Director was able to do so without obtaining any approval from nor informing the Board or even the management of the Company. &nbsp;</p>
<p>23. In relation to the Termination and the Licence Expiry, while the CFO and the CEO were respectively aware of material information that required immediate disclosure, they failed to escalate such information to the Board timeously.&nbsp; In particular, the Board ought to have been notified of:</p>
<p>(a) the Termination at the latest in January 2023, when the CFO received the Termination Notice from the Subsidiary Director; and</p>
<p>(b) the impending Licence Expiry and the status of PT SB&rsquo;s renewal application in or before February 2023,&nbsp;</p>
<p>so that proper disclosures could be made in compliance with the Company&rsquo;s disclosure obligations under the Catalist Rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>24. While the Company asserted that it had policies and procedures in place for escalating material information to the Board, it was not able to produce any evidence to substantiate the existence of internal controls it purportedly implemented at the material time, despite SGX RegCo&rsquo;s requests.&nbsp; There was a complete lack of any formal documentation for the purported policies and procedures that were in place. The fact that the Termination could be carried out without the Board&rsquo;s knowledge or authorisation and stay undetected by the Company for more than a month, coupled with the absence of any evidence to the contrary, indicates a lack of proper internal controls, policies or procedures in place for the oversight of the operations and affairs of PT SB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>25. Given that PT SB was a key operating subsidiary and contributed significantly to the Group&rsquo;s revenue at the material time, the Board and management ought to have put in place an appropriate system of checks and balances for the exercise of powers by PT SB&rsquo;s management as well as a proper mechanism for the reporting of material information about PT SB to the Board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>26. As a result of an absence of internal controls, the Board was not made aware of the Termination and the Licence Expiry in a timely manner, which led to the Company&rsquo;s breaches of its disclosure obligations under the Catalist Rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Second breach concerning Catalist Rule 703(1)(a), read with Catalist Rule 302(6) &ndash; Causing the Company to fail to promptly disclose the Termination on or around 23 February 2023, a piece of material information known to the Company which was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the Company&rsquo;s securities</strong></em></p>
<p>27. Pursuant to Catalist Rule 703(1)(a), the Company must announce any information known to the Company concerning it or any of its subsidiaries, which is necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the Company&rsquo;s securities.</p>
<p>28. The Group&rsquo;s primary source of revenue is the production and sale of coal, and PT SB was the Group&rsquo;s only coal mining entity at the material time. &nbsp;Given that PT GEL was PT SB&rsquo;s sole cooperation partner, the Termination and consequently, the suspension of coal production and delivery of coal by PT SB would have a material impact on the financial performance and position of the Group. &nbsp;The Company ought to have disclosed the Termination on or about 30 November 2022, when the Termination took effect.</p>
<p>29. While the CFO was notified of the Termination sometime in January 2023, he did not escalate the material information immediately to the Board for consideration. &nbsp;The Board was only made aware of the Termination belatedly on 23 February 2023. &nbsp;As an executive officer of the Company, the CFO&rsquo;s duties extend not just to managing the financial affairs, but also to escalate material information to the Board to ensure regulatory compliance and accountability to shareholders.&nbsp; The CFO&rsquo;s inaction in January 2023 caused the Company&rsquo;s further delay in disclosing the Termination, which resulted in the market trading on an uninformed basis during the relevant period.</p>
<p>30. Despite the Board&rsquo;s knowledge of the Termination on 23 February 2023, the announcement continued to be further delayed till 1 March 2023 due to the Head of Compliance&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; The Company explained that the Head of Compliance was the only officer capable of drafting SGXNET announcements, as the alternate had left the Company two months ago and there was no replacement.&nbsp; SGX RegCo is of the view that having decided that an immediate announcement on the Termination be released, it is not acceptable for the Board to then let the matter rest simply because the designated preparer was not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>31. While SGX RegCo notes that Mr. Lim had followed up with the management on the status of the announcement on 27 February 2023, this is not sufficient.&nbsp; The Board, having been made aware of the more than two months delay in announcing the Termination, ought to see to it that the breach was promptly rectified.&nbsp; The Board had thus not demonstrated reasonable efforts in ensuring the Company&rsquo;s compliance with its disclosure obligations under the Catalist Rules.</p>
<p><em><strong>Third breach concerning Catalist Rule 703(1)(a), read with Catalist Rule 302(6) &ndash; Causing the Company to fail to promptly disclose the Licence Expiry on or around 25 February 2023, a piece of material information known to the Company which was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in the Company&rsquo;s securities</strong></em></p>
<p>32. At the material time, the Group&rsquo;s entire operations constituted a single segment, which was the exploration and mining of coal in Indonesia and the Licence encompassed the Group&rsquo;s only coal mine concession.&nbsp; Given the materiality of the Licence, its actual expiry without renewal was information that required immediate disclosure. The lack of such disclosure could mislead shareholders to assume that there was no major change to the Group&rsquo;s business and prospects, which was not the case.</p>
<p>33. As a member of both the Board and management, the CEO played a fundamental role in facilitating the flow of information from the management to the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite his knowledge of the impending Licence Expiry in or before February 2023 (along with the fact that the Licence had yet to be renewed), he did not escalate the material information to the rest of the Board.&nbsp; The early escalation would have enabled the Board to ensure that the Company made timely disclosure when the Licence was not renewed and expired, to enable shareholders to make informed investment decisions in respect of the Company&rsquo;s securities.</p>
<p>34. According to the CEO, he did not inform the Board about the Licence Expiry as he had expected the renewal to occur seamlessly, given the administrative nature of the renewal process and PT SB&rsquo;s prior successes in renewing the Licence.</p>
<p>35. As a result of the CEO&rsquo;s late notification, the rest of the Board was only made aware of the Licence Expiry on 8 March 2023, and could only take steps to publicly disclose the Licence Expiry on the following day. &nbsp;This resulted in the Company&rsquo;s public disclosure being made approximately two weeks after the Licence Expiry.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment by SGX RegCo</strong></p>
<p>36. The Board asserted that the Termination was an isolated lapse by a rogue employee at the subsidiary, rather than a reflection of broader governance issues.&nbsp; One director also asserted that documentation of internal controls is not as critical for a small issuer with limited resources (like the Company), as key management personnel are close to the Company&rsquo;s operations and should know what they have to do, even without written procedures.</p>
<p>37. SGX RegCo expects all directors to exhibit a minimum level of care, skill and diligence in the discharge of their fiduciary duties. &nbsp;Directors must devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the issuer (regardless of the issuer&rsquo;s size), including implementing adequate supervisory and monitoring mechanisms over the operations and affairs of its principal subsidiaries. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>38. While SGX RegCo acknowledges that the comprehensiveness of documentation may depend on the size of an issuer&rsquo;s business operations,&nbsp;the Company and the Board are still obliged to take reasonable steps to establish adequate procedures, systems and controls to meet the Company&rsquo;s obligations under the Catalist Rules, particularly at PT SB (a principal subsidiary owning the Group&rsquo;s only coal mine concession), and ensure that sufficient guidance was provided to the Group&rsquo;s staff to procure the Company&rsquo;s compliance with the Catalist Rules. &nbsp;However, there was no substantive evidence that the Company and the Board had done so.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory concerns</strong></p>
<p>39. Every listed issuer is expected to have in place adequate and effective systems of internal controls and risk management systems.&nbsp;This is an essential component to safeguard the issuer&rsquo;s business and further its objectives. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>40. In the current case, the Board&rsquo;s conduct fell short as no systemic internal controls were implemented for the Group, particularly at the principal subsidiary level.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that the Board had provided positive attestations on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal controls in its annual reports, it was clear that the Company did not have sufficient oversight of the operations and affairs of PT SB, which increased the risk of unauthorised actions being taken by the subsidiary&rsquo;s management. &nbsp;The absence of established procedures for timely escalation of material information to the Board, coupled with the management&rsquo;s lack of appreciation for the Company&rsquo;s disclosure obligations under the Catalist Rules, directly led to the Company&rsquo;s disclosure breaches in relation to the Termination and the Licence Expiry. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalist Rule 302(6) provides that a director or executive officer is deemed to have contravened a Catalist Rule when he or she caused the issuer to omit to do an act which resulted in a breach of the said Catalist Rule.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC today released minor updates to Regulatory Guide 216&nbsp;<em>Markets Disciplinary Panel</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-216-markets-disciplinary-panel/" title="RG 216 Markets Disciplinary Panel">RG 216</a>) to reflect recent Panel decisions on the application of the new penalty regime imposed by the&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Strengthening Corporate and Financial Sector Penalties) Act 2019&nbsp;</em>and current MDP processes.</p>
<p>The new penalty regime significantly increased the maximum penalties for conduct occurring wholly on or after 13 March 2019. Recent MDP decisions have stated that a penalty should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be proportionate to the conduct of the market participant in the sense that it should strike a reasonable balance between deterrence and oppressive severity</li>
<li>promote market integrity by acting as a deterrent to any future misconduct by the participant and as a general deterrent to industry, and</li>
<li>be just and appropriate, taking into account the totality of the conduct and whether there are factually related contraventions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The updates to&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-216-markets-disciplinary-panel/" title="RG 216 Markets Disciplinary Panel">RG 216</a>&nbsp;also reflect current MDP processes, including that MDP hearings can now be conducted virtually.</p>
<p>This version replaces guidance issued in January 2021.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The MDP is a peer review panel responsible for making decisions about whether infringement notices should be given for alleged contraventions of the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/market-integrity-rules/" title="Market integrity rules">market integrity rules</a>&nbsp;by market participants.</p>
<p>RG 216 explains the disciplinary framework for the market integrity rules, the function of the MDP, and the policies that the MDP will take into account when making decisions about alleged contraventions of the market integrity rules.</p>
<p>ASIC took over responsibility for market supervision in August 2010. At that time, ASIC established the MDP to make decisions about alleged contraventions of the market integrity rules.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/markets-disciplinary-panel/mdp-outcomes-register/" title="MDP Outcomes Register">MDP Outcomes Register</a>&nbsp;contains details of the outcomes of decisions of the MDP in relation to alleged breaches of the market integrity rules.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has published its updated approach to Outcomes-Focused Regulation after considering wide ranging feedback from financial services firms, consumer groups and law firms.</p>
<p>An outcomes-focused approach means the FMA focuses its resources on the end results that regulation is aiming to achieve for consumers and financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FMA published its approach to outcome focused regulation. It received more than 50 submissions from a range of interested parties. The consultation closed in March 2024, and the FMA has carefully considered and adjusted its approach to reflect the feedback.</p>
<p>Clare Bolingford, Executive Director, Regulatory Delivery said: &ldquo;The approach focuses on the most significant risks and opportunities for New Zealand businesses, investors, and consumers, helps reduces unnecessary regulatory burden on the industry, and provides market participants with greater flexibility in meeting regulatory obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our public consultation last year, the FMA sought to test what fair outcomes are for consumers and markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this document we have reframed the outcomes in response to the feedback we received, to clarify them and to better show how they link to the FMA&rsquo;s main statutory objective and the purposes of our legislation,&rdquo; Ms Bolingford said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="button-link--blue-dark"><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/assets/Corporate-Publications/FMA-Outcome-focused-regulation.pdf" title="This document provides an update in the evolution of our approach to outcomes-focused regulation. It details how we approach regulation and provides examples of our outcomes-focused approach. ">Download Outcomes-Focused-Regulation approach [PDF 1.6MB]</a></span></p>

<title>ASIC Chair Joe Longo Spoke With AICD Managing Director And CEO Mark Rigotti At The Recent Australian Governance Summit</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-chair-joe-longo-spoke-with-aicd-managing-director-and-ceo-mark-rigotti-at-t-2025320/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The AICD Australian Governance Summit was held in Sydney on March 12. The following question and answer session followed&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-times-they-are-a-changin-but-directors-duties-aren-t/" title="The times they are a-changin&rsquo;&ndash; but directors&rsquo; duties aren&rsquo;t">Joe Longo&rsquo;s keynote speech</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;And thank you for everyone who&rsquo;s contributed. There are three upvoted questions around simplification and not-for-profits, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to paraphrase the tenor on them. But people are interested to hear, I think, your thoughts on regulatory complexity and the job that you&rsquo;ve given this committee to do, and how that applies to NFPs. How are you potentially involving the ACNC, the NFP peaks, and the likes? Is that something you could talk to, the peak bodies, the NFP peak bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:&nbsp;</strong>In the speech, I talk about this problem being in the water. So, we all need to step back and say, why are we where we are? And the fact of the matter is, this is a wicked problem, and we all contribute to it.</p>
<p>And what do I mean when I say that? As a society, when things go wrong, we tend to respond with regulation. So, parliament plays a role. Society plays a role. The legal profession plays a role. So, we all contribute directly or indirectly to what we&rsquo;ve got. And so, we are where we are, and you say, well, how do we approach this problem? So, it&rsquo;s a wicked problem.</p>
<p>So, my personal view is that it has to start with ASIC. And there have been multiple reports on the Corps Act. There&rsquo;s the major report on Chapter 7 by the Australian Law Reform Commission, a superb piece of work, over several years. Before that, they did a report on corporate criminal responsibility and misconduct. And there have been multiple reports historically. So, it&rsquo;s not as if we don&rsquo;t have some idea as to what to do.</p>
<p>But from my approach, I believe we need to start with ourselves. There&rsquo;s a lot that &hellip; ASIC administers the law in all sorts of ways. We have all sorts of approaches. And I think the work with the simplification group is to look for ways that ASIC can improve the administration of the Act and make it more efficient and accessible.</p>
<p>And sort of underlying that approach is that it&rsquo;s very difficult, just to be realistic, it&rsquo;s hard to get law reform. As I said last year, with good faith and intent, successive governments amend the Corps Act rely on legislation to solve the problem. And it&rsquo;s the cumulative effect of that is where we are today. So, wholesale law reform to the Corporations Act, I think, is going to require a very significant bipartisan effort.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Well, this is good news.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;It is.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;The audience has spoken, and they&rsquo;ve upvoted a question from a young fellow called John Green. Which I think it&rsquo;s more of a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Is he still talking about fuzzy law?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll talk about anything. Look, it was an interesting idea he said, that would ASIC simplification involve the use of AI and putting all those pages of the Corporations Act into an AI tool.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;d call that a quantum leap. At the moment, I&rsquo;ve said it to a number of people in my area about legislative instruments that can&rsquo;t be found, and that don&rsquo;t make any sense. And it wouldn&rsquo;t it be a great idea if we just got rid of them all and had one basic instrument that people could find? So, I think that we need to get some baby steps that we have to take. And I think part of that is I want people to feel that if we&rsquo;ve got a problem and a suggested solution, how ASIC can be of use to the law better. But I want to hear it, I&rsquo;m looking for actionable ideas.</p>
<p>I think AI would be revolutionary. But the way I would turn around John&rsquo;s question of that question, and I&rsquo;ve said this publicly several times, I think as the regulator, if we ourselves don&rsquo;t successfully embark on a digital transformation, and ourselves have a technology capability, over time we will become irrelevant. And I see that as an existential risk.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Look, it&rsquo;s good to see ASIC taking the leadership and being open to change itself. And I guess the onus is then on us to come up with actionable ideas, as you mentioned. It&rsquo;s much easier to work on specific things than sort of a statement of intent.</p>
<p>I did want to come back to sort of the NFP theme, because, again, just to give us all some ideas. So, if this group produces some good ideas and you want to take them forward, what level, or do you see there is an opportunity to interact with other agencies? Typically, APRA, people like that. Just to make &ndash; we pick something in one place in government and then&hellip;.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;The focus will be ASIC, but the Treasury are observers on this group, as are Julie Abramson from the Productivity Commission. So, it&rsquo;s a broad group, if I can put it that way. The expert panel is made up of a number of individuals, and it&rsquo;s one or two in this room. And the idea, in a nutshell, is that there will be proposals, ideas, and then you can send them off to a group and you can work out an approach with the help of the ASIC Secretariat.</p>
<p>So, the idea is, in the coming months, we need to translate a complaint, a feeling, an idea, a frustration into something actionable. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really pleased with the number of people who have approached us, who approached me to be on this panel. There&rsquo;s a lot of support, and it&rsquo;s voluntary. I really, really appreciate that. And that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to work. We already have, I think, at least half a dozen, I would call them actionable ideas, and now they have to be worked up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really pressing the team hard at ASIC, and Nick Evans is a very passionate supporter of this work. So, I&rsquo;m pretty optimistic that we&rsquo;ll come up with some ideas. They may not be profound, but I&rsquo;m hoping they&rsquo;ll be practical, and they will signal a real intent to the market that we&rsquo;re serious.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Look, I think there&rsquo;ll be a lot of support for that on the ideas. I mean, maybe just to stay with this, and then we&rsquo;ll get to directors being distracted, stay focused, know your business, those sorts of things around what we can each think about. But there is one suggestion from Pauline Collins about having a legislative drafting expert involved. And I think the point that she makes is to keep it simple. Some of the best and most powerful pieces of regulation aren&rsquo;t actually trying to cover the field. They&rsquo;re setting the tone.</p>
<p>And I guess while you&rsquo;re on that, you might try and also just give us your thoughts on this tension between principles-based regulation and rules-based regulation, which is where I think the ASIC&rsquo;s corporate governance principles have maybe gone off, the guidelines have gone off piste a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, the Office of Parliamentary Council is responsible for drafting federal legislation. They&rsquo;ve actually published the material on simplicity. Although that&rsquo;s not always entirely evident when you open up the Corporations Act and related regulations. So, I think we have to start with the right idea for change and operationalising.</p>
<p>But the prescription, the principles versus prescription issue, I&rsquo;m a firm, broadly speaking, I believe the principles are better than prescriptive regulation. And in fact, in the area of directors&rsquo; duties, those concepts that we see in the Corps Act, they&rsquo;re my favourite examples of any ordinary person can read those sections, and they can actually understand what they&rsquo;re reading. And it reflects hundreds of years of jurisprudence. Those concepts of due care and diligence, they all come from the case law.</p>
<p>So, the only other thing &ndash; so I am personally more in favour of a principles-based approach. But again, I think we all need to have some self-awareness here and look in the mirror. Because we&rsquo;ve, Mark and I, we&rsquo;ve been lawyers for a long time. And I think there&rsquo;s a real phenomenon in business where it&rsquo;s a bit schizophrenic. There are some problems, and we just want the principles. And then there are other times when, can you just give us more guidance? Can you just tell us what we have to do? Can you give us more certainty?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole body of practice and thinking around our regulatory guidance. There are several schools of thought. There&rsquo;s one school of thought, oh, they&rsquo;re too long, too prescriptive. There&rsquo;s another school of thought that&rsquo;s, no, they&rsquo;re about right. And there&rsquo;s another school of thought that would like them to be longer still. Will you please include more case studies and examples so we know exactly what to do? So, I think there&rsquo;s an underlying cultural issue there somewhere. And I think as a society we like certainty. But that comes at a price.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a very interesting comment. There&rsquo;s been a question from Will in here I was just trying to find, who&rsquo;s also, who&rsquo;s written in the California Management Review, where there&rsquo;s been some studies done which have found excessive regulation can actually create perverse outcomes. Because people think it does cover the field. So, if I&rsquo;m not picked up, I&rsquo;m OK. So look, it&rsquo;s a tension, and the regulator really has to try and navigate it.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, and also, it&rsquo;s an issue about the advisors. I mean, it&rsquo;s all part of an ecosystem. If you have a culture that encourages conservative, defensive lawyering or compliance advice, well then that&rsquo;s going to be reflected in long, complex documents that I would call defence documents. The real audience isn&rsquo;t ordinary people like you and I; it&rsquo;s a judge. So, if things go wrong, you can point to this paper trail or document. And I think that&rsquo;s, I hate to say it, I think that&rsquo;s part of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, maybe there&rsquo;s some examples issue by issue or sector by sector, because you can create higher levels of trust between, almost a compact between the private sector and the regulator representing the consumers and the citizens. You can get more done. And they&rsquo;re good. We were talking about this example before during COVID. The ACCC and the authorisations they gave to the banking industry, and arranging virtual meetings, all of those things.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;They get stuff done, but hopefully you don&rsquo;t have to wait for a crisis every time.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;No, let&rsquo;s do it without a crisis. Let&rsquo;s not go back to COVID. Five years declared yesterday, it&rsquo;s enough. Yeah. Maybe just changing topics a little bit, because you started out by talking about directors, your advice to us as directors should focus on the foundational issues. Don&rsquo;t get distracted. What are some of the distractions you think might be where we take our eye off the ball, are getting drawn down into rabbit holes? What are the sorts, did you have anything in mind?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;My intent in putting it that way was that should be reassuring. I think in Australia we had some well understood values, principles, expectations of directors. It can actually be easily summarised in a couple of paragraphs. And I suppose what I&rsquo;m saying to everyone is, in these extraordinary times, where you&rsquo;ve got all these demands being put on you, just keep an eye on those foundational values and principles. I think John Mullen was making that point yesterday as well. I mean, I thought he gave a terrific speech, and I think John Green as well. Keep your eye on those basics. And I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s going to be perfect, your business is going to be perfectly profitable. But you should be staying out of regulatory trouble if you keep an eye on those basics.</p>
<p>Now, and the other &ndash; and so that&rsquo;s sort of really where I was coming from. Having said that, I think some things do have to change. I do worry about technology. I mean, I worry about it at a range of levels.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:&nbsp;</strong>Hence your more science in the boardroom.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but just as an expectation, I think so many of us, our children, we&rsquo;re now living in an age where digital platforms, social media, technology, the way in which we absorb information, the way in which we entertain, the way in which communication happens, that whole subject, it seems to me, poses challenges for all of us at all levels.</p>
<p>Now, the AI regulation, or AI, I think is a fantastic example of it. I find that a totally overwhelming topic, and I get briefed about it regularly. I&rsquo;ve got a terrific internal team. ASIC has great connections with academic institutions around Australia. We&rsquo;re plugged in internationally. And as John pointed out yesterday, we&rsquo;ve taken an interest AI. And that&rsquo;s just exploded in the last few weeks. As I was told yesterday when I asked for some help on that topic. So, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any easy answer to that.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t get distracted, know your business.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s interesting, at the AICD we were privileged enough to bring a couple of directors to talk to the AFR about the Trump effect. And an hour and a half later, when everyone&rsquo;s trying to work out how to navigate this, it came down to some simple kind of things; know your company, know your strategy. Work out what the changes or the potential changes might mean for your company and your strategy. So those foundational principles can be pretty strong. I don&rsquo;t know, how are you thinking about this changing world? How is ASIC thinking about the changing world that we&rsquo;re in?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;All the time.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Is that too big a topic?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;All the time. I think the digital &ndash; I actually meant what I said. I think the digital transformation technology part, it&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s challenge, including for me and for regulators. Now, I&rsquo;ll go back to AI, because I think it&rsquo;s obviously a very topical, fantastic example. IOSCO is doing a piece of work on AI at the moment. And like so much IOSCO work, you won&rsquo;t see the product until sometime next year. But what I&rsquo;m worried about there is the rapidity of change and innovation and developments in that area. It&rsquo;s going to be hard for regulation to keep up.</p>
<p>So, it might be something you were talking about a moment ago that lends itself more to principle. But even that might be deficient, because it&rsquo;s in the very nature of that technology that key concepts of accountability and explainability. When you read into this, it&rsquo;s really very difficult stuff. A lot of business don&rsquo;t understand how their own algorithms work. They don&rsquo;t know where their data is. I think it&rsquo;s a really difficult subject to get your head around, is my view.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think we all agree that it&rsquo;s been a major theme through the last few days. And I think part of it is, again, bringing some of the coffee conversation into the room, was there&rsquo;s a literacy level. And we&rsquo;re probably all struggling with that.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. And I&rsquo;m struggling with that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but then there&rsquo;s actually an expertise level. And what level of expertise do you as an individual need to achieve? Or can you actually go and get it?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:&nbsp;</strong>Well, the way I explain it is, I think for a lot of us who are reasonably well read, you can ask the first three or four questions. So, you have your engagements. It&rsquo;s a seventh, eighth and ninth question, that I can&rsquo;t &ndash; that&rsquo;s the real test. It&rsquo;s getting from the superficial to the next level. And I think that requires a lot of curiosity and work. And you&rsquo;ve got to do the work and read in and get help.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Yep. Well, work in progress. Watch this space. Just looking at the time, there&rsquo;s a few people in the audience who would like to explore probably a slightly sensitive topic. So don&rsquo;t worry &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;You know I&rsquo;m not good at sensitive topics.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;No. So, I guess, let me try and paraphrase it. We&rsquo;ve seen some of the governance stories hitting the press at the moment go to the issue of, I guess, personal behaviours, and whether that disqualifies someone from being the director or impacting. How are you thinking about that? I know you&rsquo;ve got the enforcement functions. What&rsquo;s got the guidance on?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve already answered that question, under oath. I&rsquo;ll try to remember what my response was. So, in addition to what I said in the speech, and I&rsquo;m more serious now, I can&rsquo;t comment on any particular matter. As we know, ASIC is looking at some of them, and we&rsquo;ll see where that ends up.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important, as I tried to explain at this parliamentary hearing, that poor personal behaviour isn&rsquo;t necessarily a breach of the law. Or certainly not of the Corporations Act. Maybe a breach of some other laws, but not of the Corporations Act. So, I think as a society and a community, a professional community, a well-functioning board, I think those of us, that we all are thinking about what&rsquo;s poor personal behaviour, and we want to discourage that. A well-functioning board, I would have thought, will find that very distracting from the main gain. Now, whether that is a breach of the directors&rsquo; duties or a breach of the law&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a legal question.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. And I suppose my intent on that day in Canberra was to say, look, there are limits to what the law is there for. We all have to take responsibility for our conduct, whether it&rsquo;s personal or professional, and some of those consequences don&rsquo;t deserve to be in the court. So, there has to be another response. And I think that&rsquo;s where the rest of the board, the shareholders, the chair, there should be other mechanisms that correct, if you like, the core consequences of that behaviour.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes it will be so serious that ASIC will get involved, and we may or may not take action.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;No, but that&rsquo;s understood. I guess it&rsquo;s that judgement, that discernment, which is the difficult issue.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;I think the first line of defence is the board itself. I think this is where chairs, all the board members, contribute to the culture and well-functioning of the board. And it&rsquo;s people again, right? You can have these principles, but what matters in the end is how people get on with one another. I think John Mullen made that point yesterday as well. So, I think these are foundational concepts. That&rsquo;s where I would go.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for that. There&rsquo;s one topic that you didn&rsquo;t cover, but it might be good just to step into for a couple of moments, and that&rsquo;s the private markets. Because you&rsquo;ve got the paper that&rsquo;s out there. It&rsquo;s getting a bit of press. I think it&rsquo;s been picked up in various ways, including, are our public markets shrinking? Is that a good or bad thing? And this is a bit of an exam question. Our private capital markets aren&rsquo;t growing. What does that mean for directors? Where should we be thinking about participating in, particularly if there&rsquo;s a perception that being a director in a public market company is harder because of regulatory burden, whether that&rsquo;s true or not, put it to one side. I just wonder whether &ndash; I know you&rsquo;ve got a discussion paper out there, and you&rsquo;re looking for people to respond to it.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;A couple of things. It&rsquo;s a big subject, and I do commend the discussion paper to you, particularly the forward that I wrote. But I think the key point here is what I&rsquo;m particularly interested in among a number of things, is to what extent is regulation standing in the way? Just putting this broadly as my regulation and someone else&rsquo;s, standing in the way of well-functioning private and public markets. In other words, getting the outcomes that we all think we want. And even then, there isn&rsquo;t a consensus as to what those outcomes are. But just say broadly speaking. So, I&rsquo;m very interested in that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that there is a narrative around high expectations of directors and boards of publicly listed companies. But I&rsquo;m not convinced that&rsquo;s the main reason why people don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s definitely a factor. I think we need to acknowledge that being a director of a public company carries with it a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p>But as the Professor Harold Ford&rsquo;s piece that you&rsquo;ve attached to the paper shows, the modern capital &ndash; the capital requirements in modern times for a lot of entities, they&rsquo;re quite happy to tap the private market. And they&rsquo;re not really ready to go to the public market. And so, I think we need to be a bit sophisticated and thoughtful about what&rsquo;s really going on here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping what will happen over the next period of time in our second piece of work is that we&rsquo;ll be able to answer those questions more confidently. But as things stand, I don&rsquo;t think that regulation is the main driver of de-equitisation in our public markets.</p>
<p>The other side of that question, though, is interesting, Mark, and I&rsquo;ll just quickly mention it. And the other question you ask is, well, do we need to regulate the private markets any more than they&rsquo;re already regulated? And by the way, they&rsquo;re not unregulated, but are we happy with what&rsquo;s going on there in terms of valuations and confidence?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s probably the three views that you mentioned before. Some would say, it&rsquo;s just fine the way it is. Others would say a little bit more. And others would say there&rsquo;s a lot more required.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it&rsquo;s the same question under another guise, isn&rsquo;t it? And so, I don&rsquo;t go into this exercise with any preconceptions about the need for re-regulation or additional regulation in the private markets. At the end of the day, as the discussion paper tries to say, we want well-funded &ndash; we need both.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;It does go to purpose, doesn&rsquo;t it? Because, I mean, public markets were originally developed to allow access to capital from widely distributed sources. You can get that from private markets.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Longo:</strong>&nbsp;And also, private equity, the conventional exit strategy, was going popular, but now we have continuation funds. We have &ndash; I&rsquo;m trying to think of the right phrase. A secondary market now, where those kinds of investments can be traded privately without going to &ndash; and you can realise your investment without having to go public. So, I think there&rsquo;s a lot going on there.</p>
<p>And I suppose the only other point I would make, and we haven&rsquo;t talked about superannuation a lot, is the discussion paper really wants to highlight that as well, that we need to understand the role of super in our markets. Which I think, by the way, is positive. But we still need to understand it.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rigotti:</strong>&nbsp;Look, we&rsquo;re at a time. There&rsquo;s a whole lot of stuff in there, but one thing I&rsquo;d encourage you to think about on the public and private markets; what&rsquo;s the role of directors across those two markets? So, if they do think there&rsquo;s a contribution directors can make to evolving both, because the better outcome for the country is you have strong public markets and investment in the private markets, and you regulate it to an appropriate level. Easy to say, hard to achieve.</p>
<p>Look, can you please thank the Chair? We&rsquo;re out of time.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For January</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-january-2025319/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-january-2025319/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for January 2024. The next release, which will report on data for February 2025, is scheduled for April 16, 2025.</p>
<p>The sum total in January of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC outflow of $48.8 billion. Of this, net foreign private outflows were $74.8 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $26.0 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in January; their net purchases were $0.2 billion. Net purchases by private foreign investors were $59.2 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $59.0 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of<br />$45.4 billion.<br />After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign sales of long-term securities are estimated to have been<br />$45.2 billion in January.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $32.3 billion. Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $53.9 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $57.5 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website here.&nbsp;<br /><br />About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data. These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy. For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data. The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries. In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data. For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, everyone &ndash; welcome to ISDA&rsquo;s first ever Athens Derivatives Forum. First, I&rsquo;d like to thank the Hellenic Capital Market Commission (HCMC) for its invaluable support in making this inaugural event possible. I&rsquo;d also like to thank our sponsor, the Hellenic Bank Association &ndash; we really appreciate your support.</p>
<p>The genesis of this event was a conversation with HCMC chair Vassiliki Lazarakou about a year ago. She suggested it would be a good time to hold an event on derivatives in Greece given the strong growth and development of the Greek economy, increased capital markets and financing activity, and the growing need for robust risk management tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased we&rsquo;ve been able to act on her suggestion. I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing Ms. Lazarakou&rsquo;s remarks shortly, and I&rsquo;d like to thank her for her support and encouragement in getting this event off the ground.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Greece has come a long way since the sovereign debt crisis more than a decade ago. The country is now very much an EU success story, with GDP growth of 2.1% in 2024, outperforming the euro area average and making it one of the fastest growing economies in the EU. This is projected to continue, with the European Commission forecasting growth of 2.3% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026.</p>
<p>Critically, the good economic fundamentals and continued fiscal reforms have meant Greece is now rated investment grade by Fitch Ratings, Moody&rsquo;s Ratings and S&amp;P Global once again. In announcing its upgrade just last week, Moody&rsquo;s cited stronger public finances, a reduction in the debt burden and improved health of the banking sector as among the reasons for its decision.</p>
<p>This has had a knock-on impact on the country&rsquo;s capital market and participation by both domestic and international investors. In particular, Greece is once again seen as an attractive investment opportunity for overseas institutions, increasing the depth and liquidity of local financial markets.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the EU is focused on competitiveness and strategic partnerships.&nbsp; There were two important reports released in 2024, before the formation of the new European Commission.</p>
<p>One report from former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta on the future of the EU single market highlighted three broad themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accelerated integration of key sectors, including telecoms, energy and finance.</li>
<li>Investment in knowledge, including digital innovation and sustainability.</li>
<li>Regulatory simplification to encourage economic competitiveness.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other, from another former Italian prime minister and former president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, covered the future of European competitiveness and highlighted similar topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Annual investment of over &euro;700 billion to support energy, defense and digitization to ensure EU greater self-sufficiency.</li>
<li>Improved industrial coordination to enable greater autonomy.</li>
<li>Regulatory reforms to help EU competitiveness internationally.</li>
<li>Advancement in skills to support the innovation economy.</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategic plans will require massive coordination and long-term commitment. But they will also require hundreds of billions of euros in annual investment. The demands for funding have only become larger with geopolitical changes that are prompting a rethink of Europe&rsquo;s defense strategy.</p>
<p>European capital markets, including those in Greece, will play a critical part in supporting and enabling the massive investment needed by governments and the private sector, and derivatives will play an equally important role.</p>
<p>Derivatives are an essential component of any robust, vibrant and competitive economy, because they allow companies to transfer risk, manage liquidity needs and enhance returns. They help create certainty by enabling firms to lock in financing terms, reduce costs, dampen the impact of market volatility and enhance financial performance. This allows companies to plan confidently and make strategic investments, contributing to business expansion and economic growth.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we published a new report to mark our 40th anniversary, which shows that 87% of nearly 1,200 companies across seven major stock indices use derivatives for a variety of purposes. That includes blue-chip multinational corporations, agricultural companies, asset managers, pension funds and banks.</p>
<p>This vast universe of companies all over the world use derivatives because they find them useful, and because they create value by enhancing predictability and protecting against losses.</p>
<p>To give a couple of examples, an academic study of almost 7,000 firms in 47 countries found that companies using derivatives had lower cashflow volatility, reduced financing costs, higher returns, and greater investment capacity.</p>
<p>Another study of over 14,000 companies by the Bank for International Settlements showed those using derivatives to manage interest rate risk on their debt faced smaller declines in equity value after rate hikes.</p>
<p>From manufacturers that use interest rate swaps to lock in predictable debt costs, to exporters that use derivatives to secure stable conversion rates when receiving overseas revenues, to energy producers and distributors that hedge oil, gas or electricity prices to help protect consumers against sudden price rises, derivatives play a critical role in creating certainty and stability, which gives companies the confidence to borrow, invest and hire.</p>
<p>ISDA has played a key role in derivatives markets since our inception 40 years ago. A fundamental part of our mission has been to develop robust legal standards and documentation, starting with the publication of the ISDA Master Agreement, which sets out the terms for a derivatives trading relationship and allows two counterparties to net their various obligations into a single payment in the event of a default.</p>
<p>This has continued to be a priority for ISDA, and our suite of standard industry documents and best practices now runs into the hundreds &ndash; with one of the most recent additions being the ISDA Global Financial Power Purchase Agreement Confirmation Template.</p>
<p>Consistent with the Letta and Draghi reports is the underlying theme of improving EU competitiveness and cost-efficiency.&nbsp; When it comes to addressing efficiency in derivatives markets, ISDA has a plan. For years, we have been working to develop mutualized industry solutions to solve common industry challenges.</p>
<p>This includes the ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model (ISDA SIMM), which provides a common methodology for the calculation of regulatory initial margin requirements, cutting costs for market participants and mitigating the potential for disputes. The ISDA SIMM is widely used around the world to support the efficient exchange of initial margin and has strong support from the official sector.</p>
<p>Another example is the ISDA Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative, which uses the open-source Common Domain Model to transform an industry-agreed interpretation of new or amended regulatory reporting rules into unambiguous, machine-executable code. This makes implementation of reporting requirements more efficient and cost effective and reduces the potential for regulatory penalties for misreported data.</p>
<p>Our newest solution is the ISDA Notices Hub, which enables the instant delivery and receipt of critical termination notices through an online platform, reducing the risk and potential losses associated with a delay in terminating a derivatives trade. We&rsquo;ll be rolling out this solution in June, so please do look out for that.</p>
<p>ISDA is a global association with over 1,000 member firms from 76 countries, and our focus is to foster safe, efficient derivatives markets around the world. Several of the large Greek banks are already members, so if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about the benefits of membership, please do reach out to me or one of my colleagues or visit the ISDA website.</p>
<p>In my remarks, I&rsquo;ve briefly sketched out the positive outlook for the Greek economy and outlined the vital role that derivatives play in fostering healthy, competitive and liquid financial markets.

<title>Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-2025319/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-issues-fomc-statement-2025319/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. Beginning in April, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion to $5 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; and Jeffrey R. Schmid. Voting against this action was Christopher J. Waller, who supported no change for the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings.</p>

<title>CFTC: Generative AI Is Making It Easier For Fraudsters To Fool The Public</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new Commodity Futures Trading Commission customer advisory says generative artificial intelligence is making it increasingly easier for fraudsters to create convincing scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the latest Office of Customer Education and Outreach customer advisory,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2025/03/AI_fraud.pdf"><em>Criminals Increasing Use of Generative AI to Commit Fraud</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>crooks are using AI to create fake&nbsp;<span>images, voices, videos, live-streaming video chats, social media profiles, and malicious websites designed to look like legitimate financial trading platforms.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCEO advisory describes how fraudsters use AI to create fraudulent identifications with phony photos and videos that can appear very real if one is not familiar with the advances of AI technology. The fraudsters also are using AI to forge government or financial documents.&nbsp;<span>An&nbsp;</span>FBI&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203#fn1">public service announcement</a>&nbsp;also warns the public about how criminals are using AI to commit fraud and how the technology is being used in relationship investment scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fraudsters can use new technologies to mask their identities, not only in still photographs, say, in social media profiles, but also in video chats that alter their facial features and voices to match,&rdquo; said OCEO Director Melanie Devoe. &ldquo;Identifying real from fake can be difficult. The best defense is to never give money to people you only meet online.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advisory provides specific actions people should take to protect themselves, including strengthening social media account privacy settings and keeping personal or sensitive information private, especially from people they only know online or callers using phone numbers they don&rsquo;t recognize<span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></p>
<p>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups.

<title>Three Of The World’s Largest Financial Institutions Join The Canton Network’s Global Synchronizer Foundation - The Additions Of Goldman Sachs, HKFMI, And Moody’s Ratings To The Foundation Further Strengthen Canton’s Decentralized Financial Ecosystem</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/three-of-the-worlds-largest-financial-institutions-join-the-canton-networks-gl-2025319/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Global Synchronizer Foundation, in conjunction with the Canton Network, the world&rsquo;s only public layer one blockchain network with control and privacy, today announced that Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong FMI Services Limited, and Moody&rsquo;s Ratings have joined the Global Synchronizer Foundation (GSF) as its newest members. The additions to the GSF underscore the growing momentum and trust Canton Network fosters across the financial services industry.</p>
<p>These institutions' collective commitment to participation in the GSF comes at a pivotal moment for the Canton Network, as the momentum behind tokenized assets grows and market leaders seek to unlock the potential of synchronized financial markets. Their inclusion reinforces the adoption of a decentralized financial infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, control, and seamless interoperability&mdash;a combination essential for regulated financial institutions.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the Global Synchronizer Foundation, I am pleased to welcome our new members and their valuable industry perspectives. Each of them contributes to strengthening the governance while ensuring the Global Synchronizer of the Canton Network remains an open, fair, and trusted blockchain infrastructure," said Jorgen Ouaknine, GSF Chairperson and Global Head of Innovation &amp; Digital Assets at Euroclear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joining the Global Synchronizer Foundation aligns with our ongoing commitment to driving blockchain innovation in regulated financial markets,&rdquo; said Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Goldman Sachs Digital Assets. &ldquo;We are excited to be part of the GSF and look forward to contributing to the Canton Network&rsquo;s growing ecosystem&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our participation in the GSF highlights a significant step in our robust Digital Economy preparedness strategy,&rdquo; said Fabian Astic, Managing Director and Global Head of Digital Economy at Moody&rsquo;s Ratings. &ldquo;This collaboration underscores our commitment to helping market participants understand the risks and opportunities of Digital Finance, and to meeting stakeholders where they are in their preferred digital channels. It also provides us with an opportunity to further engage with leading institutions working towards enhanced transparency, security, and scalability in the digital financial markets of the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Decentralized Governance</i></b></p>
<p>The Global Synchronizer is a cornerstone of the Canton Network&rsquo;s decentralized infrastructure, providing real-time synchronization and interoperability for regulated financial assets. Unlike traditional systems that rely on centralized governance and data silos, the Canton Network is governed by a community of participants, including financial institutions, fintech innovators, and service providers. This structure ensures that no single entity controls the network, enabling greater trust, resilience, and innovation.</p>
<p>As part of the GSF, Goldman Sachs, HKFMI, and Moody&rsquo;s Ratings will play an important role in the ongoing governance and expansion of this decentralized ecosystem. The GSF is an independent U.S.-based entity composed of forward-thinking market participants dedicated to ensuring that the Global Synchronizer is governed transparently in a decentralized manner with organizational neutrality to maintain its integrity. The Linux Foundation supports the GSF under an open governance model that fosters trust and neutrality.</p>
<p><b><i>Driving Industry Innovation and Growth</i></b></p>
<p>With the new additions joining the ranks of more than 30 GSF participants, including Broadridge, Tradeweb, and Digital Asset, the Canton Network continues to build on its reputation as a market-leading infrastructure. The addition of these industry leaders reflects the accelerating demand for a decentralized public blockchain network with configurable privacy capable of handling the unique challenges of global capital markets.</p>

<title>Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission Announces Mandatory Clearing Order For New Taiwan Dollar Interest Rate Swap, Effective July 1</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/taiwan-financial-supervisory-commission-announces-mandatory-clearing-order-for-n-2025319/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/taiwan-financial-supervisory-commission-announces-mandatory-clearing-order-for-n-2025319/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has announced that the mandatory clearing regulations for New Taiwan Dollar Interest Rate Swap (TWD IRS) will take effect on July 1, 2025. Starting from this date, banks, securities firms, bills finance companies, insurance companies, trust enterprises, leverage transaction merchants, and other financial institutions designated by the FSC will be required to submit their TWD IRS transactions, accepted for clearing by the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX), for central clearing.</p>
<p>TAIFEX has been designated by the FSC as the clearing institution for over-thecounter (OTC) derivatives and has been officially recognized as a Qualifying Central Counterparty (QCCP) by the FSC. In addition, TAIFEX has obtained relevant clearing institution qualifications from international regulatory bodies, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Financial Services Agency of Japan (JFSA). These recognitions affirm that Taiwan's regulatory framework and clearing system meet international standards, facilitating foreign institutional participation in the OTC derivatives market. With QCCP status, both domestic and foreign financial institutions will benefit from a reduced counterparty credit risk capital charge of as low as 2% when calculating capital requirements for cleared contracts. This effectively lowers capital costs and improves capital utilization efficiency.</p>
<p>Since launching OTC clearing services in July 2022, TAIFEX has continuously enhanced market infrastructure to ensure that the clearing system meets the needs of financial institutions. TAIFEX has also provided one-on-one guidance and assistance to help financial institutions smoothly participate in central clearing. Currently, 45 banks and securities firms have already joined as clearing members or clients, and three more financial institutions are set to join by the end of March, demonstrating that market participants are well-prepared for compliance with the mandatory clearing requirements. The FSC&rsquo;s announcement of the implementation of the TWD IRS mandatory clearing mechanism is expected to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>TAIFEX reminds firms that do not currently engage in TWD IRS transactions to onboard as either clearing members or clients before conducting such transactions. Additionally, financial institutions should ensure that their counterparties are also eligible for central clearing to comply with regulations. TAIFEX will continue to offer guidance and consultation services to assist new participants in adapting to the central clearing mechanism. Relevant information is available on the TAIFEX website under the OTC Central Clearing InfoHub.</p>
<p>Central clearing is a global trend, as regulators worldwide mandate financial institutions to clear specific OTC derivatives to mitigate systemic risk. With the support and guidance of regulatory authorities, Taiwan&rsquo;s upcoming implementation of the TWD IRS mandatory clearing requirement will further enhance market resilience, improve capital efficiency for financial institutions, and ensure alignment with international financial markets.</p>

<p id="continue-jump">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cash consideration for the Acquisition, of &pound;22.50 per TISE ordinary share, values the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of TISE at approximately &pound;70.4 million (<span class="xn-money">$91.5 million</span><span>1</span>), representing approximately &pound;66.4 million (<span class="xn-money">$86.4 million</span><span><sup>1</sup></span>), net of proceeds received from the expected exercise of options subsisting under the TISE Share Plans. MIH East Holdings currently owns 29.46% of the issued ordinary share capital in TISE.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Guernsey, TISE provides financial markets and securities services to public and private companies.

Gallagher</span>, Chairman and CEO of MIH. "We are committed to growing our international business and believe that investing additional resources in TISE will help expand its reach and capabilities. We look forward to working with the TISE team to develop new relationships with member firms and issuers and collaborate on opportunities for TISE's future growth."</p>
<p>"This offer is a testament to the significant progress we have made in executing our strategy to grow and diversify the business, as well as an endorsement of Guernsey as a leading international finance centre. Transformed from a local stock and bond market, today TISE is an established operator of public markets with an enlarged portfolio of financial markets and securities services for both public and private companies," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Anderson Whamond</span>, Chair of TISE. "The recommended cash acquisition recognises the strength of the business and enables our shareholders to realise the value of their investment. We are excited about the opportunities to collaborate with MIH to expand TISE's offering across&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Europe</span>&nbsp;and internationally."</p>
<p>TISE's board of directors intends to unanimously recommend the acquisition, which is intended to be effected by means of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part VIII of the Companies Law of Guernsey. The Acquisition is subject to the approval of the requisite majority of TISE ordinary shareholders and the satisfaction of other regulatory approvals, among other conditions, further details of which are set out in the announcement released today regarding the Acquisition.</p>

Further information on the LTI programmes is available in NZX&rsquo;s annual report. </span></p>
<p><span> NZX also advises that a portion of the performance rights issued to the members of its executive and management teams in 2020 and 2022 and in one case 2023, have vested. These vested performance rights give the holder the options to acquire ordinary shares in NZX. NZX has issued ordinary shares to each holder that has exercised the options. NZX also confirms that 643,500 of performance rights relating to TSR-based LTI and other performance hurdles lapsed on 31 December 2024. </span></p>

<title>ASIC Puts Car Finance Under The Microscope Including Outcomes For Regional And First Nations Consumers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC is launching a review into the motor vehicle finance sector this month with the aim to drive better consumer outcomes, particularly for those living in regional and remote locations, including First Nations communities.<span style="font-size: 11px;">ASIC will look at compliance of lenders, brokers and other intermediaries, and will also review how loan defaults, hardship practices and dispute resolution processes are managed.</span></p>
<p>The review will cover the practices of seven lenders and pinpoint opportunities for improvement across the sector. ASIC will also identify brokers and intermediaries to be included in its review as the project progresses.</p>
<p>We will take enforcement action to protect consumers where appropriate.</p>
<p>Our focus will be on the motor vehicle finance sector broadly, noting misconduct in used car finance sold to vulnerable consumers remains a&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/asic-enforcement-priorities/" title="ASIC enforcement priorities">key enforcement priority</a>&nbsp;for ASIC in 2025.</p>
<p>ASIC currently has proceedings against car finance company Money3 Loans Pty Ltd for alleged breaches of responsible lending obligations (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-126mr-asic-sues-money3-loans-for-responsible-lending-breaches/" title="23-126MR ASIC sues Money3 Loans for responsible lending breaches">23-126MR</a>). ASIC also has proceedings against car dealership Diamond Wheels, Keo Automative, and a former director, for allegedly providing unlicensed car loans to consumers, many of whom paid an excessive interest rate (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-209mr-asic-sues-south-west-sydney-car-dealership-for-alleged-unlicensed-lending/" title="24-209MR ASIC sues south-west Sydney car dealership for alleged unlicensed lending">24-209MR</a>). We continue to investigate other matters in the sector.</p>
<p>This project seeks to strengthen processes, practices and compliance across the car finance industry and address the potential for consumer harm. ASIC aims to improve the experiences of consumers, who are borrowing money to buy a car, particularly people residing in regional and remote locations, including First Nations peoples.</p>
<p>Initial high-level insights from ASIC&rsquo;s review will be published in the second half of 2025, followed by a more detailed public report.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Improving consumer outcomes is a key strategic priority for ASIC. Misconduct impacting First Nations people is also an enduring enforcement priority.

<title>Crime Stoppers And The BC Securities Commission Encourage Anonymous Tips, As AI-Enabled Fraud Spreads In B.C</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/crime-stoppers-and-the-bc-securities-commission-encourage-anonymous-tips-as-ai-2025318/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fraudsters are increasingly depending on artificial intelligence (AI) to create fake identities and scam us out of our money. Chatbots, deepfakes and fake reviews are often successful in leading unsuspecting victims to financial loss, identity theft, and other serious consequences.</p>
<p><span>This month, Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers (MVCS) and the BC Securities Commission (BCSC) are urging British Columbians not to fall victim to AI-generated scams and report information anonymously to either agency.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Like any crime, anyone with information about a fraud that could help police or agencies like the BCSC catch fraudsters can be submitted to Crime Stoppers ANONYMOUSLY,&rdquo; said Linda Annis, Executive Director of Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers. &ldquo;You can certainly call police but an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers means no one will know who you are. The BCSC can also accept information anonymously through its Whistleblower Program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frauds with the highest level of financial impact are investment fraud, phishing, and romance scams designed to get victims to send money, or give away sensitive information like social insurance numbers, passwords or banking details.</p>
<p>The BC Securities Commission has launched an edgy new fraud prevention ad campaign to help British Columbians avoid becoming a victim to AI investment scams.</p>
<p>The<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25YYb_Ymr9Y" target="_blank"><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not All F**ked&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>campaign</a>&nbsp;acknowledges the anxiety many feel about AI while encouraging British Columbians to watch out for red flags of any investment scam including claims of guaranteed high returns with no risk, pressure to commit quickly, unanswered questions, or exploitation of family, friendship or social connections to create a sense of trust.</p>
<p><span>A special BCSC microsite&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.avoidaiscams.ca/" target="_blank"><span>avoidAIscams.ca</span></a><span>&nbsp;offers tips and information for investors to protect themselves from AI investment scams.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;AI is a new tool for fraudsters to use to deceive investors, but the warning signs are much the same as other types of investment fraud,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the first line of defense. So, it&rsquo;s more important than ever that you pause, think critically, and do your own research before investing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) says Canadians lost more than&nbsp;$638 million to fraud in 2024, and the problem gets worse every year. Losses reported to the CAFC since 2021 total more than $2 billion, with only an estimated five to 10 per cent of fraud actually being reported.</p>
<p><span>About Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers</span></p>
<p>Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers is a non-profit society and registered charity that receives anonymous tip information about criminal activity and provides it to investigators. Anonymous tips may be provided through Crime Stoppers&rsquo; downloadable&nbsp;<span>&ldquo;P3&rdquo; app</span>, calling Crime Stoppers at&nbsp;<span>1-800-222-8477</span>, online at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.solvecrime.ca/" target="_blank">solvecrime.ca</a><span>,</span>&nbsp;or by following the link on the Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/metrovancouvercrimestoppers/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers accepts tips in 115 different languages and will pay a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest, a charge, recovery of stolen property, seizure of illegal drugs or guns, or denial of a fraudulent insurance claim.

<title>Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Launches 3 New Bullet Indices - Tel-Bond Bullet 2029 ILS, Tel-Bond Bullet 10/2028 CPI And Tel-Bond Bullet 2029 Israel Meitav Mutual Funds Will Be The First To Launch Tracking Funds On The 3 Indices</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>In November 2024, TASE launched 3 new bullet indices, comprising bonds with a same-year final maturity. This initiative aligns with TASE's strategic plan to expand the variety of investment products available to investors, and to encourage competition that will generate a broader range of products at competitive prices for the public.&nbsp; Bullet indices are designed to allow investors to fix the yield to maturity of a bond portfolio with specific characteristics. Unlike most indices, Bullet indices have a final date of redemption and cease to exist upon the redemption of their final constituent bond. This defensive product caters to investors who aim to lock in the yield to maturity of a diversified bond portfolio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>With the introduction of the three new indices, the Tel-Bond family now encompasses 48 indices, providing investors with a comprehensive suite of investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Over the past year, which was characterized by low risk appetite, bullet funds have emerged as one of the most popular and highly recommended investment products.</p>
<p>Meitav Mutual Funds will be the first to launch investment products on the 3 indices, and TASE expects to see more companies launch new products on bullet indices. The new funds will offer some of the lowest management fees in this category.</p>
<p>The novelty of the index lies in its use of government bonds or T-bills as a substitute for the bond that is redeemed during the redemption year, whereby the proceeds from the final redemption of corporate bonds are reinvested into a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; with a weight equivalent to that of the redeemed bond. For each index, a specific series is designated as filler bond, and the weight of the filler bond in the index increases over the index&rsquo;s redemption year, as the constituent corporate bonds are redeemed, ultimately resulting in an index comprised solely of filler bonds. When the filler bond reaches maturity, the index is terminated.</p>
<p>The launch of bullet-type indices in the bond market is gaining momentum, and this segment already features three index Administrators calculating more than 40 indices, with products tracking those indices totaling NIS 3.2 billion.</p>
<p>TASE will continue to expand the variety of investment products available to the public to enhance competition and reduce index product costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following is a description of the 3 new bullet indices:<br /><br /></p>

<title>IETA Calls For Clarity On Role Of Carbon Credits In EU Environmental Claims Rules</title>

<p>
<div class="elementToProof">Ahead of technical negotiations for the EU Green Claims Directive, IETA calls for clarity on the future use of emission reduction and removal credits to encourage the responsible use of credits in corporate environmental claims.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The proposal for the Green Claims Directive seeks to establish rules for the substantiation of business-to-consumer corporate environmental claims in the EU, including on the use of carbon credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">While the Commission has refrained from proposing explicit rules on the use of credits in claims, there is a push from the European Parliament to limit the use of carbon credits in corporate claims, and to set further conditions beyond disclosure requirements  for how these credits can be used.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The purpose of the Directive is to protect EU consumers from misleading claims about companies&rsquo; environmental performance. IETA urges EU policymakers to provide clarity on how carbon credits can be transparently and accurately reported without restricting the  use of credits in corporate claims.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;Companies should be able to use emission reduction and removal credits for compensation claims to drive the climate ambition we need today,&rdquo; </i></span>said <b>Andrea Abrahams, Managing Director at IETA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;These claims should not be limited to residual emissions of a company at the point of net zero, which has been proposed in ongoing negotiations,&rdquo;</i></span> <b>Abrahams added</b>. <span><i>&ldquo;A requirement for residual emissions would only deter companies from engaging in the necessary climate action on the pathway to net zero.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Moreover, the European Parliament has proposed to set limits on the claims a company can make based on the type of carbon removal credit used, whether nature-based or engineered. IETA urges EU negotiators to recognise the role for both nature-based and engineered  removals, from the EU CRCF as well as equivalent international schemes, in delivering net zero.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">The Directive will be discussed in trilogue negotiations over the coming weeks, with a provisional agreement expected before the summer recess.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<title>Almost Three Quarters Of Senior Global Financial Services Professionals Expect Financial Crime Risk To Rise In 2025 – Kroll</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Cybersecurity threats and data breaches rank as top risk factor, cited by 68% of those who expect an increase &nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></i></li>
<li><i>Half (49%) say that keeping up with evolving regulations is the biggest challenge in sanctions compliance<b>&nbsp;</b></i></li>
<li><i>Just one-third (33%) of professionals feel &ldquo;very prepared&rdquo; to address geopolitical risks over the next 12 months</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.kroll.com/en">Kroll</a>, the leading independent provider of global financial and risk advisory solutions, has today released the 2025 Financial Crime Report, finding that over 71% of executives across financial and professional services anticipate a rise in financial crime risks in 2025.</p>
<p>The report highlights cybersecurity, AI, regulatory complexity, geopolitics and sanctions as key issues in the fight against fraud and financial crime in 2025.</p>
<p><img alt="Financial Services Professionals Expect Financial Crime Risk to Rise in 2025" src="https://media-cdn.kroll.com/jssmedia/kroll-images/insights/financial-crime-report-2025/financial-crime-2025-prchart.svg" />&nbsp;<span>Figure 1: How do you expect financial crime risks to change, if at all, over the next 12 months?</span></p>
<h3>Cybersecurity Leads the Charge in Risk Exposure</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity threats have been a growing trend in recent years, and the data shows that concern is on the rise and the perception of AI in financial crime compliance is shifting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over two thirds (68%) of financial services professionals who expect financial crime risk to increase in the year ahead identify cybersecurity as the biggest driver of exposure and nearly half of organizations (49%) expect to invest in AI solutions as part of their efforts to tackle financial crime.</li>
<li>However, just a fifth (20%) of respondents believe AI has had a &ldquo;very positive&rdquo; effect on their financial crime compliance framework &ndash; down from 37% in 2023.</li>
<li>Over a quarter (27%) of organizations have AI and machine learning as an established part of their financial crime compliance programs, exceeding 2023 levels (24%).</li>
<li>AI is primarily being used to identify suspicious behavior (63%), followed by network analysis (54%) and identifying risk signals (44%), as firms seek to enhance detection capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Evolving Regulation Raising Concerns</h3>
<p>Financial and professional services firms are preparing for greater enforcement action on regulations and evolving compliance challenges in 2025 &ndash; but a significant portion lack confidence in their ability to adapt, particularly with sanctions.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li>Nearly half of respondents (49%) say keeping up with regulatory changes is the biggest challenge in sanctions compliance, up from one-third (34%) in 2023.</li>
<li>Globally, just under two in five (39%) senior financial professionals say that they are &ldquo;very confident&rdquo; in their organization&rsquo;s sanctions screening capabilities, with the U.K. (34%) trailing the global average.</li>
<li>While 37% of organizations screen entirely in-house, using a third party (34%) and hybrid approach (28%) are becoming increasingly common.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Risks High on the Agenda</h3>
<p>2024 was a year of notable geopolitical events and 2025 has already begun with arguably more disruption than was seen through last year. Indeed, organizations are factoring this into their ongoing compliance efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking ahead through 2025, just one-third (33%) of respondents say that they are &ldquo;very prepared&rdquo; to address geopolitical risks over the next 12 months and only 38% are &ldquo;very confident&rdquo; in their financial compliance program&rsquo;s ability to detect emerging geopolitical threats.</li>
<li>Among those who were less than &ldquo;very confident&rdquo; in their program&rsquo;s ability to assess their supply chains for threats, more than half (56%) of global respondents identified cybercrime as the biggest challenge to their programs in 2025. This was followed by political instability (35%) and geopolitical risk (26%).</li>
<li>The insurance sector appears particularly exposed to geopolitical challenges, with nearly three-fifths (58%) of professionals expressing concern over potential new economic and financial sanctions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/our-team/david-lewis">David Lewis</a>, Managing Director, Investigations, Diligence and Compliance at Kroll says, &ldquo;From cybersecurity threats to geopolitical uncertainty, firms in 2025 are facing an incredibly complex risk environment. The changing nature of risk analysis means that businesses are expected to stay abreast of a variety of risk factors, but this becomes increasingly difficult the faster that illicit actors develop new tricks and tools.</p>
<p>What is measured can be managed, as the saying goes, and our 2025 Financial Crime Report is intended to give compliance and security teams a better measurement of the risks they face today. Firms that can best direct efforts to meet this changing landscape will be the ones that succeed, even as the outlook for financial crime grows more concerning by the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/our-team/brent-tomlinson">Brent Tomlinson</a>, Co-President of Risk Advisory at Kroll, says, &ldquo;It is a worrying, but not surprising, revelation that sophisticated financial risk and compliance leaders feel less prepared than ever to prevent and mitigate rising financial crime risks in today&rsquo;s complex global environment. We are facing a geopolitical landscape of increased macro uncertainty, more aggressive threat actors and diminished regulatory predictability.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re yet to see exactly what this year will hold, financial crime remains a major global concern and professionals in all sectors will need to be on the top of their game, partnering with experts on risk analysis, decision-making support, and mitigation plans, if they are to protect and grow their businesses.&rdquo;</p>

<title>DTCC’s NSCC To Increase Clearing Hours To Support Extended Trading - Move Builds Upon NSCC’s Continued Efforts To Meet Evolving Client And Industry Needs While Delivering Increased Value To Member Firms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-nscc-to-increase-clearing-hours-to-support-extended-trading-move-builds-2025318/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-nscc-to-increase-clearing-hours-to-support-extended-trading-move-builds-2025318/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that its National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) subsidiary will increase clearing hours to support extended trading with implementation targeted for Q2 2026, subject to regulatory review and approval of any necessary rule changes. Extending clearing hours will deliver increased client value by maximizing liquidity and reducing counterparty risk as NSCC will be able to apply its central counterparty guarantee to overnight activity across different time zones for global participants.</p>
<p>NSCC implemented phase 1 of the new extended trading hours schedule in September 2024 by enabling market centers and trading platforms to submit trades at 1:30 AM ET, approximately 2.5 hours earlier. Under plans for phase 2, which will take effect in Q2 2026, NSCC will operate 24x5, from Sunday at 8:00 PM ET to Friday at 8:00 PM ET to support overnight trading activity from Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) and Exchanges. NSCC is aware that the industry has indicated a preference to establish standard operating hours across Exchange and ATS providers for the U.S. market, and NSCC will continue to work with SIFMA, regulators and the industry to support the alignment of extended trading hours and any required changes to post-trade processes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As interest in near round-the-clock trading of U.S. equities grows, we are meeting this demand by extending our clearing hours to support our clients and further strengthen the safety and soundness of the markets,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Brian Steele, Managing Director, President of Clearing and Securities Services at DTCC</span>. &ldquo;DTCC is committed to leading large-scale, industry-wide initiatives that deliver positive change for the industry and the investing public. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively across the industry towards a successful implementation. At the same time, we remain engaged with SIFMA to align to a consistent view of the U.S. trading day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA is working across our membership on the proposed expansion of trading hours,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Steve Byron, Managing Director, Head of Technology, Operations and Business Continuity at SIFMA</span>. &ldquo;SIFMA and its membership are supportive of the establishment of a consistent U.S. trading day across exchanges which enables increased access to U.S. markets for a global client base. The expansion of trading hours, however, presents several challenges for the industry that will need to be overcome to minimize disruption to firms and existing post-trade clearing and settlement processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Dmitri Galinov, 24 Exchange CEO and Founder</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;This is a significant moment for round-the-clock trading that will provide immense global benefits. As the first national securities exchange in the U.S. that is approved to offer trading of U.S. securities 23 hours each workday, we applaud DTCC for further expanding the clearing hours offered through the NSCC. The move will support extended trading on the 24X National Exchange that we are currently building and will benefit the global broker-dealer institutions it will serve.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Blue Ocean ATS officially launched, we recognized the void in the after-hours markets and set out to empower investors worldwide to trade stocks beyond traditional hours,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Brian Hyndman, CEO of Blue Ocean Technologies.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Today, we are seeing success in our mission by affording investors more choices, tools, and data to trade while navigating volatile markets confidently, leveraging the extended NSCC hours that were introduced in September. We look forward to the additional advancements in 2026.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"DTCC's decision to extend NSCC's clearing hours is a monumental advancement that underscores the growing legitimacy and demand from the investment community for continuous trading," said&nbsp;<span>Jason Wallach, CEO of Bruce Markets</span>. "This move aligns with our vision at Bruce Markets to modernize U.S. equities trading by providing robust, secure, and dependable access during non-traditional hours. It highlights the growing demand and natural progression toward a 24-hour trading day, creating a more inclusive and responsive trading environment across global time zones."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cboe has been a leader in expanding market access, offering overnight trading for SPX options and VIX options and futures, 24x5 trading in our FX markets, and early trading hours on our U.S. equities exchange,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Oliver Sung, Head of North American Equities at Cboe Global Markets</span>. &ldquo;As we now look to leverage our global technology platform and proven market expertise to enable 24x5 trading for U.S. equities &ndash; subject to regulatory review &ndash; we are pleased to see DTCC&rsquo;s support and commitment to providing the critical clearing infrastructure that will be an essential component to a successful implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overnight trading represents the next step in the evolution of the U.S. Equity markets, offering a pivotal opportunity to broaden investor access and redefine the trading ecosystem. We recognize the magnitude of this change and the need for the industry to come together to ensure a seamless transition for market participants,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Kevin Kennedy, Executive Vice President and Head of North American Markets at Nasdaq</span>. &ldquo;As part of that collaboration, we are proud to partner with the DTCC and NSCC with the goal of providing extended clearing hours that support a robust trading environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The New York Stock Exchange is proud to be the first established equity exchange to file and receive SEC approval to extend trading hours for U.S. listed companies and funds, providing access to investors in various time zones worldwide,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Kevin Tyrrell, Head of Markets at NYSE</span>. &ldquo;This initiative highlights the continued advancement of our capital markets and the increasing global demand for U.S. listed securities. We look forward to continuing to work with the DTCC and the broader industry to further this effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;RQD is uniquely positioned with a flexible clearing platform that enabled us to quickly adopt the earlier clearing hours offered by NSCC,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Michael Sanocki, CEO of RQD</span>. &ldquo;This capability positions us to be an example of the benefits that the shift in trading hours can bring to global market participants, such as executing trades seamlessly, efficiently, and securely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele added, &ldquo;We are pleased to have worked with 24 Exchange, Blue Ocean Technologies, Bruce Markets, Cboe Global Markets, Nasdaq, NYSE and RQD, as well as SIFMA and other key stakeholders across the industry, as we extend NSCC&rsquo;s clearing hours. Reducing the time between trade execution and NSCC&rsquo;s trade clearance and guarantee process is critical in reducing counterparty risk and bringing increase safety and soundness to markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>EEX Open To Bite Sized Deals After Nasdaq Power Merger Pulled - Huw Jones, Mondo Visione CEO Insights</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>EEX, Europe's biggest energy exchange, will continue to grow rapidly and is open to acquisitions in Europe and elsewhere, though big ticket takeovers in the region, Japan and the United States are effectively ruled out due to an already strong market position, its CEO Peter Reitz has said.</p>
<p>A planned EEX merger with Nasdaq's European power trading arm in 2024 fell apart in the face of competition concerns.</p>
<p>"We're always open for M&amp;A transactions in any part of the world, including Europe, but obviously we already have a strong position with our venues in Europe, the US and Japan, so in that field there may be limited targets for acquisitions in the business," Reitz said.</p>
<p><img alt="EEX-Herr-Reitz" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/EEX-Herr-Reitz.jpg" title="EEX-Herr-Reitz" /></p>
<p><i>Peter Reitz, Chief Executive Officer</i></p>
<p>"We have acquired adjacent businesses that help our growth in the core markets over time, and that's something we will continue to do, so we are open to further M&amp;A activities also in that field," Reitz said, adding there was "nothing concrete" to announce anytime soon.</p>
<p>EEX saw growth of 63% in its main power derivatives market in 2024, with the fast clip continuing into January.</p>
<p>"We're quite optimistic that the growth trend that we've seen over the years will continue," Reitz said.</p>
<p>With the potential to convert over-the-counter (OTC) or privately traded contracts between banks, customers and brokers into on-exchange volumes now dwindling, Reitz said the main driver of growth in the coming years will be new customers and customer groups joining the exchange, including commodity hedge funds and algorithmic traders that significantly increase liquidity in the market.</p>
<p>"That's something all the existing customers benefit from, and it increases their opportunities of trading and their volume, so it's really helping the market get to a completely new level."</p>
<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022 triggered huge volatility and price spikes in Europe's energy markets as the region began weaning itself off Russian energy supplies.</p>
<p>A peace deal this year would help lower prices and boost competitiveness in the economy, Reitz said.</p>
<p>"It will have an impact on volatility and risk premiums that we see in the market, and so it will have an impact on price levels. You can already see that currently more in the gas market than in the power market," Reitz said.</p>
<p>EEX competes in Europe with the InterContinental Exchange (ICE) and pan-European exchange Euronext has hopes that its Nord Pool arm will give EEX a run for its money in the spot market.</p>
<p>"It's healthy competition and that keeps us on our toes, but it doesn't keep me awake at night because we have a very strong position in this market, having a great team that is very close to the customers, understanding their needs and developing the right solutions for it," Reitz said.</p>
<h4>Market Deregulation</h4>
<p>EEX's roots go back 25 years to a handful of people setting up the Leipzig Power Exchange with about 40 market participants focused on the German power market. Reitz joined as CEO in 2011, when the company employed about 120 people in just one location.</p>
<p>Fast forward a quarter of a century and EEX employs nearly 1,200 people based in 23 locations on five continents, and is the largest power trading platform in Europe, Japan and the United States with nearly 1,000 direct market participants in total.</p>
<p>"A lot of things come together when you see growth like this, and it all starts with the right regulatory environment we have," Reitz said, adding that deregulation of the energy market across Europe dismantled regional monopolies to trigger heady growth.</p>
<p>Another driver of growth has been the shift of trading from OTC to an exchange such as EEX, coupled with the contracts being centrally cleared, such as by EEX's clearing arm, Reitz said.</p>
<p>"When I started in 2011, about 10% of the trading in power was happening on exchanges and that has almost turned around completely. We're now closer to 90% exchange traded and cleared in some of our markets, and that has been a growth driver for us."</p>
<p>EEX's longstanding takeover spree coupled with the organic growth has seen the company expand enormously over the years, with two key transactions singled out by Reitz: the takeover of French power exchange Powernext in 2008 to bolster its footprint in the spot power market; and the acquisition of U.S. power exchange Nodal in 2017, turning the company into a major international player in energy.</p>
<h4>Helping Green Transition</h4>
<p>EEX is positioning itself to take advantage of different aspects of how economies are shifting to net-zero carbon emissions targets over coming years.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The exchange trades contracts under the EU's emissions trading system (ETS), a 20-year old set of rules that require polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions. EEX provides a platform for auctions to sell emission allowances that companies must have if they want to emit carbon dioxide into the air. The EU contract is up for renewal in 2027.</p>
<p>As part of a post-Brexit 'reset' of relations with the EU, Britain is expected to link its own emissions trading market with that of the EU, and Reitz said this would help create a regional price for carbon as a step towards a global price, which remains a "long journey" given the need for political will in countries like the United States.</p>
<p>"A lot of things we do are helping to decarbonize the economy and setting a price for carbon is just one element of it," Reitz said.</p>
<p>EEX is also moving deeper into so-called guarantees of origin or verifying that a source of power is green so that it can be separately traded.</p>
<p>In mid-February, EEX introduced a Greek power futures contract to reflect that country's significant investments in renewable energy, with the contracts tailored to the length of sunshine expected a few hours or days ahead in a sign of how hedging has become supply rather than demand driven.</p>
<p>Reitz is also confident that another essential piece in the transition puzzle will be the use of hydrogen for storing energy longer than current battery technology can.</p>
<p>"We are positioning ourselves very early on in this hydrogen market, which is still in its very early stages. We've developed an index for green hydrogen and a trading platform for hydrogen, so it's something where we're just helping to get this market off the ground," Reitz said.</p>
<p>Reitz is a veteran by exchange industry standards, having stayed so long at the top of EEX.</p>
<p>"We've been building businesses together with our customers, and that is the secret to the success. If you have success, then you enjoy what you are doing and you continue doing it."</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Global financial markets experienced heightened volatility in February, driven by President Trump's new trade and tariff policies. Despite the turbulence, the FTSE Mondo Visione Index closed the month at an all-time high of 90,434.08 points, marking a 5.6% increase from January's close of 85,623.44.</p>
<h4>Top Performing Exchanges by Market Capitalisation</h4>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of February were:</p>

<p>Conversely, India's Multi Commodity Exchange was the worst performer, reporting a 13.8% drop in share price. India's BSE (-13.6%) and Brazil's B3 (-7.5%) were close behind.</p>
<h4>Tariff Policies Add to Market Challenges</h4>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione and Co-founder of the Index commented on the month's volatility:</p>
<p>"Global markets faced turbulence as President Trump announced a series of new tariffs set for 2025. These include a 20% duty on Chinese goods, 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and reciprocal tariffs targeting countries imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Navigating February's financial landscape was like solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded."</p>

<p>Today (18 March), the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced details of the launch of the procurement process for the pilot Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT) issuance.</p>
<p>HMT has published additional information, engagement questions and has issued a Preliminary Market Engagement Notice through the contract finder service. This provides further information on the scope of the DIGIT pilot and seeks views from potential suppliers including the financial services sector, to inform the development and delivery of DIGIT.</p>
<p>In November 2024, the Chancellor of the Exchequer&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/mansion-house-2024-speech">announced at Mansion House</a>&nbsp;the launch of a pilot Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT) issuance, leveraging cutting-edge distributed ledger technology (DLT). This announcement was followed by a&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-11-18/hcws228" rel="external">Written Statement to Parliament</a>, outlining further details of the issuance and highlighting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to engaging with the sector in 2025.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement represents the first step of the Government&rsquo;s work with the sector towards achieving a successful DIGIT issuance. This exercise will allow the Government to understand the current landscape of services available, or in development, in the UK, as well as to gain insight into what potential investors want to see from a DIGIT issuance to help inform HMT&rsquo;s commercial strategy.</p>
<h3 id="the-digit-pilot">The DIGIT Pilot</h3>
<p>DIGIT will support the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the UK as a world-leading and global financial centre. As other financial hubs explore DLT, the potential for significant growth in this area is clear. By launching now, the Government is positioning the UK financial services sector to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>The pilot is seeking to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the Government to explore how DLT can be applied to UK sovereign debt issuance processes.</li>
<li>Catalyse the development of UK based DLT infrastructure and the adoption of DLT across UK financial markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pilot&rsquo;s initial design features have been set in order to meet these aims and include DIGIT being digitally native, short-dated, issued on a platform operating within the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/digital-securities-sandbox" rel="external">Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS),</a>&nbsp;and independent of the Government&rsquo;s main debt management programme.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>HMT and the DMO are seeking responses to the questions in the Preliminary Market Engagement Notice by 11.59pm on 13 April 2025.</p>

<title>First Regulated Financial Market Infrastructure For Trading And Settlement Of Digital Assets In Switzerland</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>BX Digital is the first Swiss financial market infrastructure to receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA for a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) trading facility, laying the foundation for a leading regulated platform for digital assets &ndash; a groundbreaking milestone for the Swiss financial market.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Boosting innovation in the Swiss financial centre, playing a pioneering role in Europe</b></li>
<li><b>Providing access to trading new types of digital assets</b></li>
<li><b>Fast, cost-effective and secure transactions thanks to public blockchain (Ethereum)</b></li>
<li><b>Settlement of the cash leg with a direct link to the payment system of the Swiss National Bank</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;The granting of the licence* by FINMA to operate a DLT trading facility is an important step in setting new standards for capital market efficiency and customer access in the digital asset space. Regulated secondary markets have been lacking so far. BX Digital aims to become the leading Swiss financial market infrastructure for trading and decentralised settlement of digital assets.&rsquo;, explains Dr. Lidia Kurt, Chief Executive Officer of BX Digital.</p>
<p>The central element of the new DLT trading facility is the settlement in Swiss francs and the transfer of assets on a public blockchain &ndash; without the need for intermediaries such as central securities depositories (CSDs). This not only saves time and money but also enables the trading of tokenised assets such as shares, bonds and funds to be traded between market participants such as banks and securities firms. This greatly simplifies processes while ensuring the highest level of security and control over assets. Payments and asset transfers at BX Digital are based on verified delivery versus payment (DvP) agreements. A direct connection to the Swiss National Bank's payment system enables seamless integration with existing banking systems.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are very excited to launch this new type of financial market infrastructure. By integrating a public blockchain into the existing financial system, BX Digital is making a significant contribution to the efficiency of the capital market and the breakthrough of digital assets,&rsquo; says Andreas Ruflin, Chief Digital Officer of BX Digital.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To ensure the necessary liquidity, BX Digital offers market participants regulatory certainty, sets clear quality standards for trading and ensures the presence of market makers. In close collaboration with its sister company, the Swiss stock exchange BX Swiss, a ground-breaking and highly reliable platform has been developed in a short period of time. The level of interest is tremendous. We have already been able to attract an ecosystem of partners and got banks and issuers excited about our new financial market infrastructure,&rsquo; says Lucas Bruggeman, Chief Executive Officer of BX Swiss Exchange and Chairman of the Board of Directors of BX Digital.</p>
<p>BX Digital is part of Boerse Stuttgart Group, the sixth largest exchange group in Europe. &lsquo;We are convinced of the benefits of blockchain technology for the European capital market. As pioneers, we want to shape the digital European market infrastructure for tokenised assets and thus lay the foundation for the completion of the capital market union. BX Digital is the first step, and our digital European issuance and settlement platform will follow soon,' said Dr. Matthias Voelkel, Chief Executive Officer of Boerse Stuttgart Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*FINMA has granted BX Digital authorisation to operate a DLT trading facility, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. The authorisation will become legally effective once these conditions have been met. BX Digital will not commence operations and accept clients until these conditions are met.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Authorises Offa For Home Purchase Plans</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-authorises-offa-for-home-purchase-plans-2025318/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-authorises-offa-for-home-purchase-plans-2025318/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has authorised Offa, the UK's leading Islamic property finance fintech, to provide home purchase plans (HPPs), the Sharia-compliant alternative to conventional residential mortgages, for customers across the UK.</p>
<p>The authorisation will soon allow Offa, which has been expanding rapidly via acquisitions, staff hires and product launches, to become the third active provider of HPPs in the market.</p>
<p>Offa believes that this is the first licence by the FCA for a home purchase plan to a newly-authorised entity in more than seven years. It is another major accomplishment for Offa, the first Sharia-compliant bridging finance provider and the team that&nbsp;previously introduced the first Sharia-compliant buy-to-let (BTL) product to the UK.</p>
<p>Sultan Choudhury OBE, Executive Chairman at Offa, said: &ldquo;This is a significant and hard-won milestone for us at Offa. The real winners of course will be our customers, who will now gain greater access to our fast and easy Islamic home finance services thanks to our modern, tech-driven and paperless systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By combining our teams&rsquo; decades of industry experience with the latest technology, we are bringing Islamic finance into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, leaving behind the onerous paperwork and cumbersome systems that many customers have typically had to suffer in the past Gaining this important authorisation is another step toward achieving that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riaz Husain, Chairman of Offa Money Ltd, added: &ldquo;Receiving this authorisation from the FCA will provide reassurance to our customers that Offa is adhering strictly to regulations as we provide high quality, faith-based Islamic home finance products to aspiring property investors and landlords across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since charging interest is forbidden in Islamic finance, a Home Purchase Plan involves the Islamic finance principles of co-ownership-with-leasing where customers acquire the property in partnership with Offa and make monthly payments to increase their share, over time owning it. Sharia-compliant BTL is based on the same principle except that those customers make payments from received rental profits.</p>
<p>The company recently acquired Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Alburaq Sharia-compliant home finance portfolio in a landmark deal utilising a unique funding structure, including more than 350 home purchase plans.</p>
<p>Offa provides an ethical finance model designed in accordance with Islamic finance principles, which means not charging interest and investment into sectors deemed harmful to society &ndash; such as alcohol, tobacco, animal testing, and the arms trade.</p>

<p>This draft Statutory Instrument (SI) forms part of the Chancellor&rsquo;s Mansion House 2024 commitments and is part of a wider package of reforms to boost UK capital markets&rsquo; attractiveness.</p>
<p>At Mansion House 2024, the Chancellor announced the government&rsquo;s intention to make further technical changes to the wholesale markets framework. This included a commitment to commence the revocation of the detailed firm-facing regulations within the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) Organisational Regulation (Org Reg) so they can be replaced in the FCA and PRA rulebooks.</p>
<p>To deliver on this commitment, HM Treasury will (1) restate elements of the regulation that defines regulatory activity and (2) commence the revocation of firm-facing provisions which can benefit from delegation to the expert regulators who have day-to-day experience of supervising financial services firms. The Treasury will do this alongside the FCA and PRA delivering their replacement rules in H2 2025.</p>
<p>The near-final version of the Statutory Instrument takes forward this approach, restating the sections of the Org Reg that are being maintained in legislation. The government invites any technical comments by 14 April 2024.</p>

<title>Active Super Ordered To Pay $10.5 Million Penalty In ASIC’s Third Greenwashing Court Action</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Court today imposed a penalty of $10.5 million against Active Super for greenwashing misconduct.</p>
<p>In June 2024, the Federal Court found that Active Super contravened the law when it invested in various securities that it had claimed were eliminated or restricted by its environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment screens.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This is a significant penalty that sends a strong message to companies making sustainable investment claims that those claims need to reflect the true position.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This case demonstrates ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to taking on misleading marketing and greenwashing claims made by companies promoting financial services. It is our third greenwashing court outcome, and we will continue to keep greenwashing in our sights.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Active Super claimed in its marketing that it eliminated investments that posed too great a risk to the environment and the community, including gambling, coal mining and oil tar sands. Following the invasion of Ukraine, Active Super also made representations that Russian investments were &lsquo;out&rsquo;.</p>
<p>However, contrary to these representations, Active Super held direct and indirect investments in companies such as SkyCity Entertainment Group Ltd (gambling), Gazprom PJSC (Russian entity), Shell Plc (Oil tar sands) and Whitehaven Coal (Coal mining).</p>
<p>His Honour, Justice O&rsquo;Callaghan said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not disputed that LGSS&rsquo;s contraventions were serious. LGSS benefitted from its misleading conduct by misrepresenting the &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; nature of a significant part of its investments, which on any view enhanced its ability to attract investors to the Active Super fund and enhanced its reputation as a provider of investment funds with ESG characteristics. As a result, investors lost the opportunity to invest in accordance with their investment values.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Further, the contravening conduct continued over an extensive period of time (approximately two and a half years); the likely causes of it were never explained; it concerned substantial investments; it was likely to have led to investors losing confidence in ESG programs; and the failure by LGSS to have in place properly functioning systems and processes designed to ensure that its representations were not false or misleading was the responsibility of senior management. Further, when confronted with the allegations by ASIC, LGSS ran a host of contrived arguments in its defence at trial.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Active Super was a profit to member superannuation fund that merged with Vision Super on 1 March 2025. Prior to its merger, as at 30 June 2024, Active Super managed approximately $14.7 billion in superannuation assets for 86,547 members.</p>
<p>The below two visual representations were published in Active Super&rsquo;s Impact Report and are subject of ASIC&rsquo;s proceeding:</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Files Criminal Charges Against David McEwen</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has filed criminal charges against former financial adviser David McEwen, for failing to comply with an FMA stop order, due to concerns he is still contacting potential investors.</p>
<p>The FMA issued Mr McEwen and a number of entities associated with him a stop order in December 2023 that prohibited him from:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Making offers, issues, sales or other disposals of McEwen and Associates&rsquo; financial products,</li>
<li>Distributing any restricted communication that relates to an offer of McEwen and Associates&rsquo; financial products,</li>
<li>Accepting further contributions, investments, or deposits in respect of McEwen and Associates&rsquo; Financial Products.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;McEwen and Associates&rsquo; financial products&rsquo; was defined to mean, among other things, financial products offered by Mr McEwen or a number of entities associated with him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA alleges that Mr McEwen failed to comply with the stop order by continuing to make offers and accept contributions for financial products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA understands Mr McEwen has lived abroad since November 2023. Mr McEwen has been served with the charges, has entered a not-guilty plea and did not attend Court. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement Margot Gatland said: &ldquo;We are concerned that Mr McEwen is continuing to flout the prohibitions of the stop order and may be causing potential harm to investors in doing so. I strongly recommend that investors contacted by Mr McEwen or entities associated with him, in relation to the offer of a financial product, report it to the FMA.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charges were filed in the Auckland District Court.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced conditional approval of the application for financial technology (fintech) company SmartBiz Loans to change the business model of CenTrust Bank, N.A., Northbrook, Illinois, upon its acquisition of CenTrust Bank, N.A.</p>
<p>Upon acquisition, CenTrust Bank, N.A. was renamed SmartBiz Bank, N.A. CenTrust further applied to change its business model to conduct small business lending activities on a nationwide basis.</p>
<p>The OCC granted a change to the business model after thorough review of SmartBiz and its current operations. In granting this application, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all new entrants to the federal banking system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A safe, sound and fair fintech business model has a place in today&rsquo;s federal banking system,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood. &ldquo;This conditional approval demonstrates the OCC&rsquo;s commitment to a regulatory framework that supports innovations in banking that expand access to financial services for consumers and communities across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal banking system includes more than 1,000 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the United States that range in size from community banks under $10 billion in assets focused on meeting local needs to the largest internationally active banks. These banking companies conduct a wide array of businesses that range from retail and wholesale banking activity to trust, credit card and other more narrowly focused services. The institutions that make up the federal banking system conduct approximately 66 percent of the banking activity in the United States, hold more than $16 trillion in assets combined, and manage more than $67 trillion under their custody and fiduciary control.</p>

<title>SEC Charges New Jersey Investment Adviser And His Firm With Fraud And Other Violations - Defendants Disregarded Their 2021 Settlement And Continued Their Fraud Unabated, Causing $1.6 Million In Harm To Their Fund And The Fund’s Retail Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has filed charges against David Yow Shang Chiueh&nbsp;of East Hanover, New Jersey and his investment advisory firm, Upright Financial Corp., for misconduct and for investing more than 25 percent of Upright Growth Fund&rsquo;s assets in a single company over multiple years, causing losses of $1.6 million.</p>
<p>In November 2021, Chiueh and Upright&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2021/33-11010.pdf">settled</a>&nbsp;SEC charges that they, as investment advisers to Upright Growth Fund, violated its policy by investing more than 25 percent of its assets in one industry between July 2017 and June 2020, committing fraud and breaching their fiduciary duties. Despite being ordered to stop this conduct, the SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges, the defendants continued their fraud by violating the 25 percent industry concentration limit and making misrepresentations about it between at least November 24, 2021, and June 23, 2024. As a result, the complaint alleges that the defendants&rsquo; decision to wait more than two-and-a-half years to sell the relevant stock resulted in losses of approximately $1.6 million to the fund and its investors.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges the defendants engaged in further misconduct during this same period when Chiueh operated the fund&rsquo;s board without the required number of independent trustees and misrepresented the independence of one in filings. The defendants also failed to provide or withheld key information from the board, according to the complaint, and they hired an accountant for the fund without the required vote by the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged, the defendants not only ran the fund contrary to its fundamental investment policies, but they actively misled investors and the fund&rsquo;s board about their conduct,&rdquo; said Corey Schuster, Chief of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;Undeterred by their prior SEC settlement involving these very same issues, we allege that the defendants repeatedly violated fundamental rules designed to protect investors in mutual funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws, including provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and Investment Company Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Stephen Holden and Ming Ming Yang, and supervised by Lee A. Greenwood and Mr. Schuster, all of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit, as well as Debra Jaroslawicz, senior trial counsel in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Jaroslawicz, Mr. Holden, and Ms. Yang.</p>

<title>Remarks To The Investment Company Institute’s 2025 Investment Management Conference, Mark T. Uyeda, SEC Acting Chairman, San Diego, CA, March 17, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you, Paul [Cellupica], for the thoughtful introduction and I appreciate the invitation to address the ICI&rsquo;s 2025 Investment Management Conference. First, I&rsquo;d like to congratulate Dorothy Donohue on her well-earned retirement. Dorothy has had an impressive career spanning both public and private service, with a deep knowledge of the fund industry and its legal framework. I have worked with her on many issues over the years. She will be missed, and I wish her well on her next chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year &ndash; 2025 &ndash; marks the start of a new presidential administration, which holds tremendous potential. It has been a privilege to serve these past couple of months as the Acting Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>This year also marks a personal milestone &ndash; my thirtieth year of legal practice, which started out as a first-year associate in the &rsquo;40 Act practice of a major law firm. The practice was led by Richard &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Phillips, one of the legends of the securities bar and, equally important, a former member of the SEC staff. Dick served the Commission during the 1960s in several capacities, including assistant to the chairman, assistant general counsel, and staff director of the SEC Corporate Disclosure and Investment Company Studies.</p>
<p>During that time, I learned a few things. First, I could distinguish between an open-end and a closed-end fund. And second, I learned to have a lot of respect for the SEC staff.</p>
<p>Thus, I jumped at the opportunity to join the staff in 2006. Since then, I have had many roles at the Commission, both as part of the executive staff and in the Division of Investment Management. I have been detailed to work on issues related to funds and asset managers at the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Senate Banking Committee. These experiences, and the terrific people with whom I have worked in public service, have contributed to how I now oversee and manage the Commission as acting Chairman during this transition period.</p>
<p>I am pleased to share my perspective today on my views as to the Commission&rsquo;s upcoming work.</p>
<h2>II. A Blueprint for SEC Rulemaking Processes</h2>
<p>A core responsibility held by each SEC commissioner is the power to vote on how the agency should exercise its authority granted by the federal securities laws. Some of these votes are on the Commission&rsquo;s various rule proposals and adoptions that govern market participants.</p>
<p>My roles as counsel to multiple commissioners, as well as being a rule-writer on the staff in the Division of Investment Management, have given me a unique view into all aspects of the rulemaking process. Rulemaking, when properly conducted, is not an easy task. But the legal and policy changes implemented through rulemaking can have profound effects on investors and the markets. It was a particular privilege to lead the rulemaking team that finalized the mutual fund summary prospectus rule in 2009. I saw first-hand the importance of a robust and informed rulemaking process in producing practical rules that serve the Commission&rsquo;s mission. Not to mention, of course, that this process is required by law.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>During the past four years, however, I have expressed my concern about the changes to the Commission&rsquo;s rulemaking processes &ndash; which were not for the better.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;I have described these changes as &ldquo;rulemaking shortcuts,&rdquo; often taken in the name of expediency. Unfortunately, these shortcuts have returned to haunt the Commission in subsequent litigation. One of my objectives will be to set forth a blueprint for restoring the Commission&rsquo;s rulemaking processes to the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; among regulatory agencies. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Meaningful Engagement with Stakeholders</h3>
<p>The blueprint should start with restoring historical rulemaking comment periods. Recognizing the need for safeguards on federal agencies&rsquo; rulemaking authority, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Many of you are familiar with the &ldquo;notice and comment&rdquo; approach to rulemaking that is a key procedural requirement of that Act. An agency generally must publish a notice in the Federal Register and provide the public the opportunity to comment on the proposal.&nbsp;The notice requirement must &ldquo;afford[] interested persons a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Act does not provide a minimum period to receive comments on rule proposals.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;But, a comment period of at least 60 days has been endorsed by the Administrative Conference of the United States for significant regulatory actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Further, executive orders issued by multiple past presidents from both political parties have all recognized the importance of a minimum 60-day comment period.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>During the past four years, a significant number of proposals had comment periods shorter than 60 days&mdash;45-day, and even 30-day, comment periods were the norm. This represented a notable shift from the Commission rulemaking process, which generally had 60-day comment periods, or even 90-day comment period for more complex rulemakings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;This represented a significant deviation from everything that I had been taught about rulemaking as a member of the staff in my nineteen years with the Commission.</p>
<p>Providing thoughtful comments on rule proposals is even more challenging when the rule proposal is dense and the scope of the rulemaking is over-broad. It is nearly impossible when the Commission asks for public comment on multiple proposals affecting the same stakeholders at the same time. I was concerned to see this dynamic in considering the Commission&rsquo;s 2022 proposal on open-end fund liquidity and swing pricing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The scope of this proposal covered not only amendments to the 2016 liquidity risk management rule for funds, but went significantly further. Notably, it also proposed substantial changes to fund reporting requirements, mandatory swing pricing for funds, and a 4:00 pm &ldquo;hard close&rdquo; requirement. Commenters focused significantly on the swing pricing and hard close requirements, which would have fundamentally altered the way that open-end funds operate. The Commission later adopted only a subset of the proposal&mdash;the changes to Form N-PORT and N-CEN reporting requirements&mdash;without much public comment on those specific aspects to help us weigh the costs and benefits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>There is a tool at the Commission&rsquo;s disposal that could have been used when confronted with a comment file revealing the need for additional input. Indeed, the Commission has used this tool to great success in the past, although rarely in recent years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;This tool is the practice of re-proposing rules where appropriate, or in certain circumstances, re-opening the comment file for a rule proposal. Re-proposing rules has the benefit of taking into account issues that commenters have raised in iterating on the prior rule proposal. It also can respond to changed conditions in the markets. Re-proposal is also appropriate when significant time has passed since the original proposal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;While it is unlikely that every aspect of a Commission rulemaking proposal will be deemed perfect by commenters, some proposals generate comments that may affect important parts of the proposal. Thus, when significant changes to a proposal is contemplated, the Commission would be well-served to make use of re-proposals to focus attention on those changes.</p>
<h3>A Framework for Getting &ldquo;Back to Basics&rdquo; on Rulemaking Processes</h3>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s blueprint should include some &ldquo;back to basics&rdquo; steps to help ensure that each rulemaking proposal is as well-reasoned as possible. All Commission rulemaking actions should begin with an identification of the rule&rsquo;s purpose. What problem is the Commission trying to solve, and is it squarely within its statutory authority to engage in rulemaking to solve that problem?</p>
<p>Public engagement is often important in determining if there is a problem to solve in the first place, and if so, the range of potential solutions. The simplest form of engagement is a meeting between stakeholders and the staff or Commissioners. Under this Administration, the Commission&rsquo;s doors are open, and we are ready to have a productive dialogue. Some topics benefit from stakeholders having the opportunity to engage not just with us, but with each other. For these, public roundtables can be good options. Requests for information, concept releases, and advance notices of proposed rulemaking are additional means for obtaining feedback. These can help shape proposals, including by soliciting particular data to inform our efforts. Finally, investor testing can be particularly helpful in assessing disclosure effectiveness.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;As a sidebar on disclosure&mdash;and to build on a key lesson from investor testing&mdash;one area I would like to explore is how funds can trim their summary prospectuses to the 3-4 pages the Commission originally envisioned, from the bloated 12-15 pages often seen today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Once the problem has been identified, there are two additional steps in our decision-making. First, is the proposed regulation likely to be effective or ineffective? Second, is the proposed regulation likely to be costly or not costly? We should strive for regulations that are both effective and not costly. Engagement with our stakeholders, as well as a robust comment period, help the Commission and staff experts weigh the question of whether a proposal will likely be effective.</p>
<p>A proper economic analysis will help us distinguish between approaches that are effective and efficient, versus those that are effective but costly. The Commission is required by statute to consider efficiency, competition, and capital formation in its rulemaking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Our Division of Economic and Risk Analysis has developed robust procedures that build on this statutory mandate, recognizing that high-quality economic analysis is an essential part of our rulemaking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>In my view, there remain areas where we could update these procedures to improve our assessment of rules&rsquo; economic impacts. Compliance, attorney, and other professional costs evolve substantially over time, and our staff is currently refining processes for ensuring that our estimates of these burden inputs are as up-to-date as possible. Another area where we could improve our burden analysis is how we think about rules&rsquo; impacts on small entities. The definitions our rules use for small funds and advisers were last updated over 25 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;We are statutorily required to consider our regulations&rsquo; impact on small entities&mdash;but when our rules define only a tiny fraction of firms as &ldquo;small,&rdquo; I question how meaningful this consideration can be.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;There are not many fund complexes with net assets of $50 million or less<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;and it would seem strange to treat a $60 million fund complex the same as an $11.6 trillion fund complex. I have asked the staff to develop recommendations on amending the small entity definitions, and I look forward to considering these.</p>
<h3>Further Policy Development-- Where Do We Go From Here? &nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s blueprint needs to prioritize effective and cost-efficient regulations that respect the limits of our statutory authority. We must be clear-eyed about how existing proposals fare under this rubric. Using this framework for analysis, the Commission could consider options that include withdrawing or re-proposing existing rule proposals. My concerns with some existing rule proposals, including those addressing the safeguarding of advisory client assets, outsourcing by investment advisers, ESG disclosures for funds and advisers, and digital engagement practices, are a matter of public record.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;With respect to the safeguarding proposal, commenters expressed significant concern with the broad scope of the proposed safeguarding rule for investment advisers, which would extend the custodial requirements to virtually any asset, including crypto.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Given such concern, there may be significant challenges to proceeding with the original proposal. As such, I have asked the SEC staff to work closely with the crypto task force to consider appropriate alternatives, including its withdrawal.</p>
<p>In terms of recently-adopted rules, consideration should be given as to whether changed circumstances weigh in favor of taking a pause. We are reviewing and considering further action on whether certain rules that the Commission has adopted, but which are not yet effective, is appropriate. Some of these rules have been challenged in court. As one example, I have directed the staff to develop recommendations on re-proposing certain aspects of the recently-adopted Form N-PORT reporting requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;Additional input could help us consider if we struck the right balance or if there is new information in the time since commenters last weighed in that could inform a reconsideration. For instance, commenters raised concerns about more-frequent public disclosure of funds&rsquo; portfolio holdings. Among other issues, are these concerns heightened by continuing advances in artificial intelligence? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We also could consider extending or delaying the compliance dates for recently-adopted rules. This can assist firms by providing additional time to implement new rules in an orderly manner, when we become aware of challenges associated with the timing of the initial compliance dates. We used this approach earlier this year in the context of Form PF amendments<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;and then, last Friday, for fund names.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;The staff is also considering recommending that the Commission extend the effective date for the recent amendments to Form N-PORT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning to future rulemaking, the Commission should act like a super-sized freighter, not a speed boat &ndash; and that means returning to a smoother regulatory course than the rapid changes that have been promulgated over the last four years. Investors and the industry must be able to rely on us to act consistent with precedent and through an informed and thorough public process. Above all, we should be guided by our three-part mission: to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.</p>
<h2>III. Capital Raising and Investor Protection: Two Sides of the Same Coin</h2>
<p>Just as our capital formation efforts lead to benefits for investors, the Commission&rsquo;s investor protection role is crucial to facilitating the growth of capital markets. Simply put, investors who believe that our markets are rife with fraud will not invest. Our Division of Enforcement has a crucial mission to root out fraudulent actors from our markets and to take remedial action against market participants who do not abide by the statutes and regulations in place.</p>
<p>However, enforcement is not the sole tool of the Commission in order to achieve regulatory compliance. When there are areas where we observe compliance inconsistencies, we should remind firms of their obligations in order to flag common issues and, in the case of new requirements, ensure a smooth transition. The recent Accounting and Disclosure Information publication, or &ldquo;ADI,&rdquo; issued by staff in the Division of Investment Management this January provides an example of one way that we can do this effectively.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;The Commission has adopted a number of rules that rely on the use of layered disclosure principles, requiring funds to deliver certain concise, investor-friendly information directly, with additional detail available online for those investors who want more information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>The ADI publication was based on a staff review of current website posting practices under these rules and others that require information to appear online, including our summary prospectus rules and rules for funds operating as exchange-traded funds. The staff review found some common instances of non-compliance with the associated rules. For example, funds using a summary prospectus failed to include website addresses on the covers of their summary prospectuses indicating where the required online documents resided, and failed to include required hyperlinking within and between posted documents. And a number of ETFs did not include the information required by rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, such as historic premium and discount information. If we are to continue to move forward in an increasingly digital world, compliance with basic posting requirements is essential.</p>
<p>We should also periodically consider whether our Enforcement resources are being appropriately deployed in keeping with our investor protection mandate. I am particularly concerned about fraud targeting seniors. These individuals are relatively more likely to have amassed wealth over time, and they can be easy targets for financial abuse. Protecting seniors is a priority of the Commission, and this work ranges from enforcement, public education and outreach, and the development of regulatory policy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;The Commission has historically held &ldquo;senior summits&rdquo; in coordination with state securities regulators, FINRA, and others. These were paused following the financial crisis in 2008. Nearly 17 years later, the time is past due to reconvene these or similar events. Much has changed during this period&mdash;for example, senior fraud has become highly technological, reflecting seniors&rsquo; embrace of smart phones and social media. We need to take these developments into account in focusing on how seniors can safely prepare for their golden years.</p>
<h2>IV. Facilitating Innovation and Retirement Savings</h2>
<p>Finally, this brings me to the next theme I&rsquo;d like to explore&mdash;how can we be more flexible in our regulatory approach to facilitate appropriate innovation? As an agency we should be asking, how can this innovation best serve the interests of American investors, and how can innovation help meet the particular challenges these investors face today?</p>
<p>The last four years have been marked by an inflexible approach to innovation. We are not merit regulators. Not all products will succeed, but that does not make them inappropriate. As an example, the ETF market has grown enormously in the last 20 years, covering everything from broad market indexes to niche sectors and alternative asset classes. However, for every three ETFs launched in the last ten years, one has shut down.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;In my view, this doesn&rsquo;t reveal a general concern about ETFs as a product. Instead, this shows the natural process of experimentation, and market forces of supply and demand at play.</p>
<p>I keep this in mind as an example of the truly exciting things we can accomplish for investors if we embrace product innovation. While this innovation can be facilitated through rulemaking, I would be remiss not to mention another path for experimentation&mdash;the exemptive application process. We view this process as a laboratory where we can review new ideas from market participants. This gives the opportunity to consider the benefits of new products, as well as potential risks to investors and the market.</p>
<p>You will recall that ETFs started through the exemptive application process, and eventually the Commission codified certain conditions for ETFs to operate without obtaining an exemptive order.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;ETFs now account for approximately 30% of total net assets that investment companies manage.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-ici-031725#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;One innovation may be funds offering both mutual fund and ETF share classes. More than two years have passed since the most recent set of exemptive applications for ETF share class relief was filed. I have directed the Commission staff to prioritize their careful review of the many applications filed for this relief, and I look forward to considering their recommendations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One challenge for the fund industry to explore is how products can be developed that help Americans who have saved in IRAs and 401(k)s successfully manage their finances in retirement. Americans have a significant fear of running out of money. However, they should also be able to use their savings to enjoy their retirement years. Even if a worker has theoretically saved enough for a comfortable retirement, how can he or she be sure that the family&rsquo;s nest egg is not drawn down too soon, or too quickly?</p>
<p>This complex problem requires not only the best innovative minds in the industry to develop financial products that meet this need, but also collaboration between the SEC, Department of Labor, and state insurance regulators. We should be committed to coordinating closely with these parties as we consider the needs of investors and their retirement investments. During the first Trump Administration, there was a close relationship between the SEC and the Department of Labor on retirement security issues. I have already reached out to the new leadership at DOL and hope that we can have a similar relationship.</p>
<h2>V. Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude my remarks &ndash; a lot of which have been focused on SEC rulemaking &ndash; I am reminded of the Navy SEALs, who train a few miles away from here in the surf off Coronado. The SEALs have a saying, &ldquo;slow is smooth and smooth is fast,&rdquo; which is a reminder to take the time to do things carefully and methodically, rather than rush and risk&nbsp;actions that are not fully thought through. The same can be said for agency rulemaking and minimizing our risk to future litigation challenge.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention and I would like to invite you to discuss any of these points with me and my staff. I would be remiss if I did not take the opportunity to thank the hardworking staff of the Commission who are dedicated to fulfilling our mission. As an SEC employee for nearly 19 years, I continue to be inspired by their diligence and professionalism. Thank you and enjoy your conference.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS) has issued its official Notice of Election for the upcoming election of two members of the CalPERS Board of Administration.</p>
<p>Two seats on the board, representing all CalPERS members, will appear on the fall ballot.</p>
<p>The Notice of Election provides the timeline for the fall 2025 election, eligibility and nomination requirements for members interested in filing to become a candidate, access to required forms, and notice of an incumbent&rsquo;s intent to run for re-election.</p>
<p>Nomination petitions with required signatures, as well as candidate statements, and the nomination acceptance/ballot designation form are due by 5:00 p.m. on May 15. Candidate statement addenda are due by June 2. Ballots will then be mailed August 29, 2025, and votes must be received by September 29.</p>
<p>Votes will be processed on September 30. Voting options including online, by phone, and by mail will be available to all eligible voting members.</p>
<p>The board seats elected by retired and active members are currently occupied by David Miller and Jose Luis Pacheco. Their four-year terms expire on January 15, 2026. Miller was first elected to the CalPERS Board in 2018 and is serving in his second term. Pacheco was first elected to the CalPERS Board in 2022 and is serving his first term. CalPERS members will cast separate votes for the two positions.</p>
<p>These positions represent all CalPERS members, so both retired and active members will be eligible to vote.</p>
<p>A runoff election may be held if no candidate receives a majority of votes cast in the election.</p>
<p>Information on the upcoming election and resources for members and candidates are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/about/board/board-elections" title="Board Elections">www.calpers.ca.gov/boardelections</a>.</p>
<p>The 13-member CalPERS Board of Administration sets policy and oversees the administration of retirement and health benefits on behalf of California public employers, and their active and retired employees. The board also oversees administration of the pension fund&rsquo;s investments. Under the California Constitution, the CalPERS Board has exclusive authority to administer the CalPERS Pension Fund.</p>
