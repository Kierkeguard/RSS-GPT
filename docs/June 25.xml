</ul>
<p>The companies listed on BME's growth markets (<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx">BME Growth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup</a>) have once again demonstrated their growth capacity, with a compound annual growth rate of 27.7% in their revenue over the past ten years. This data consolidates the role of these markets as key platforms for driving the development of innovative and high-potential companies in Spain. In the last year, the turnover of these companies grew by 6.5%.<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx"></a></p>
<p>The expanding companies, a segment that includes the companies with the highest projection within these markets, have recorded even more notable growth, with an annualized increase of 30.6% in their revenue over the same period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of operating profitability, the total EBITDA of BME Growth and Scaleup companies has grown by 23% annually over the last decade, and by 23.3% in the last year alone. Expanding companies have shown particularly dynamic behaviour, with an annualised growth of 27.6% over 10 years and 32% in the last fiscal year.</p>

</div>
<p>All of this has occurred in a context marked by high uncertainty stemming from the international geopolitical environment, which has affected financial markets, supply chains, and financing costs. Despite these challenges, BME Growth and Scaleup companies have maintained a solid and sustained growth trajectory.</p>
<p>These data consolidate BME Growth and Scaleup as reference environments for companies seeking financing, visibility, and professionalization on their path towards sustainable growth.</p>
<p>The growth markets of BME welcomed 23 new companies last year and so far in 2025, another five have already debuted.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4><b>KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>A weaker US Dollar, stable oil prices, and dovish fiscal policy in China and Europe provides a positive back drop for Emerging Markets</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Companies in China and India are driving innovation, benefiting from consumption-led growth across Emerging Markets and beyond</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Latin American equity and bonds, supported by attractive valuations, stand to benefit from United States strategic retrenchment</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Chile&rsquo;s landmark pension reform signals political consensus around the importance of growth</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Pedestrian index returns over the past 15 years underline the importance of investing actively in these markets</b></li>
</ul>
<p>On Thursday 5 June, Aubrey Capital Management (&ldquo;Aubrey&rdquo;) and LarrainVial hosted a high-level investment seminar in London, bringing together investment professionals, economists, policymakers and clients to examine how shifting global power dynamics are reshaping the investment opportunity in Emerging Markets.</p>
<p>The event,&nbsp;<i>Navigating Shifting Narratives in Emerging Markets</i>, featured presentations from Louis-Vincent Gave, Co-Founder and CEO of Gavekal, John Ewart, Investment Manager (Aubrey), Camila Guzm&aacute;n, Portfolio Manager (LarrainVial Asset Management), and former Chilean Finance Minister, Ignacio Briones. The speakers were joined in discussions by Aubrey&rsquo;s Founder and Investment Manager, Andrew Dalrymple, and Fernando Larra&iacute;n C.,<b>&nbsp;</b>President of LarrainVial. Anna Macdonald, Head of Private Clients at Aubrey, moderated the seminar.</p>
<p>Louis-Vincent Gave opened the event by framing 2025 as a year of global inflection, reflecting on the rise of &ldquo;Fortress America&rdquo;. John Ewart provided a company-level view of the opportunities in Emerging Markets, focusing on Asia. He emphasised the growth of domestic consumption in countries like India and China and presented several examples of world-class businesses in areas such as electric vehicles, e-commerce and fintech. Camila Guzm&aacute;n offered a strong case for Latin American Equities, describing the region as &ldquo;under-owned, undervalued, and under-touched.&rdquo; Former Chilean Finance Minister Ignacio Briones gave a detailed presentation on Chile&rsquo;s recent pension reform, which was passed earlier this year after more than a decade of political debate.</p>
<p>The seminar took place in the historic Livery Hall of the City of London&rsquo;s Guildhall, and was attended by over 130 people representing financial institutions, pension funds, wealth managers, intermediaries and consultants, who braved the London weather. Representatives from the UK and Chilean governments were also present, led by Lord Roger Liddle, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Trade Envoy for the Andean region, and Her Excellency Ximena Fuentes, Ambassador of Chile to the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Rings Bell On New Type Of Private Stock Market In Growth Boost</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>A new type of private stock market will be launched later in 2025 after the FCA announced the final rules for its Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>PISCES is a new type of platform where shares in private companies can be traded. It will open the door to more opportunities for investors, facilitating their access to growth companies. Private companies can tap into a broader range of investors and asset managers and PISCES offers exits for shareholders to sell up.</p>
<p>As companies choose to stay private for longer, there is demand for investors to trade private company shares easily and efficiently in an organised marketplace. PISCES meets this demand by allowing secondary trading of these shares. Companies can set the floor and ceiling of share prices, and have a say over who can buy their shares.</p>
<p>Access to PISCES will be limited to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, sophisticated investors and employees of participating companies. Investors will be provided with information about the risks involved to help them make informed decisions.</p>
<p>As set out in the FCA&rsquo;s letter to the PM outlining the regulator&rsquo;s approach to support growth, PISCES can unlock capital investment and liquidity.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This bold design rebalances risk, but it is bold risk-taking that made the UK the leading financial centre it is today. The new platforms will give investors greater access and confidence to invest in exciting new companies, while early backers and employees can sell up and invest again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;PISCES is the latest step in the FCA&rsquo;s wide-ranging reforms to the UK&rsquo;s markets to boost growth and competitiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emma Reynolds, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:</p>
<p>'PISCES is a great example of industry, regulators and the government working together to go further and faster on innovative reforms to strengthen UK capital markets, supporting economic growth and putting more money in people&rsquo;s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
<p>'I welcome the FCA's announcement, which follows our legislation and opens PISCES to industry. This also builds on our announcements on a stamp taxes on shares exemption for PISCES transactions, and on employees retaining the tax advantages on eligible shares traded.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the Policy Statement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-29-private-intermittent-securities-and-capital-exchange-system" title="PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox arrangements">PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox Arrangements</a>&nbsp;(June 2025).</li>
<li>The platform will be delivered through a sandbox, which will allow the FCA to test the design before finalising a permanent regime in 2030. The sandbox is now open, with shares likely to be traded later in 2025. Trading systems could include periodic auctions, as well as occasional and time-limited periods of continuous trading.</li>
<li>PISCES will be developed using a financial markets infrastructure (FMI) sandbox. This will be the second use of the FMI Sandbox powers after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-12-digital-securities-sandbox-joint-policy-statement-final-guidance" title="PS24/12: Digital Securities Sandbox joint Policy Statement and Final Guidance">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>.</li>

<li>The sandbox environment will allow government and regulators to check it is working properly. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms wishing to run a PISCES platform will have to apply to the FCA, and once approved will be able to run intermittent trading events. The FCA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/update-pisces-pre-application-support" title="Update on PISCES and pre-application support">pre-application support</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/pisces/sandbox-apply-run-platform" title="PISCES Sandbox: apply to run a platform">application support</a>&nbsp;for firms interested in applying to be a PISCES operator.</li>
<li>The regulator and government will use any lessons from the sandbox period to improve the regime before making it permanent.&nbsp;</li>

The momentum we are seeing in Sukuk issuances signals a maturing financial ecosystem where local ambition meets global capital flows.

<title>ASIC Clears Path For Faster IPOs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Entities listing on the ASX via the fast-track process now have access to a shorter initial public offering (IPO) timetable designed to reduce deal execution risk as part of a two-year trial announced by ASIC today.</p>
<p>ASIC will now informally review eligible offer documents two weeks prior to public lodgement, which could reduce the IPO timetable by up to a week.</p>
<p>The changes mean ASIC will engage with an issuer prior to the exposure period, which decreases the need for supplementary and replacement documents and extensions to the exposure period. This also reduces the risk that market volatility and consequential pricing changes may impact investor interest in the IPO.</p>
<p>The changes also include a &lsquo;no action&rsquo; position by ASIC that now allows eligible companies to accept retail investor applications during the public exposure period for new listings, cutting down the administrative timeline of the IPO process.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the initiatives had been developed in response to the decline in Australian IPOs and public companies, highlighted in ASIC&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/dp-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-a-discussion-paper-on-the-dynamics-between-public-and-private-markets/" title="DP Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets">discussion paper on the evolving dynamics between public and private markets</a>, and form part of the agency&rsquo;s regulatory simplification focus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Creating a more streamlined IPO process underscores our commitment to ensuring our public markets remain attractive to companies and investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Greater deal certainty for companies should help deliver more IPOs, which means more investment opportunities so companies can expand, increase jobs and ultimately economic growth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our initial public offerings are the lowest they have been in over a decade, and companies are de-listing. Meanwhile, our secondary capital raising settings continue to be globally recognised for their speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earlier this year, we outlined our concerns for the future of public markets and called for actionable ideas to ensure our markets remain open, efficient and attractive to investors. I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to work with industry participants and mobilise our teams to respond to actionable ideas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we do not see regulatory settings as the silver bullet, we have received lots of ideas and are considering further regulatory adjustments to support a strong and well-functioning market,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>The changes still allow for concerns to be raised during the public exposure period and the issue of shares and quotation will still only occur once the exposure period has ended.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s new approach comes into effect today, and is the first in a series of regulatory changes it is considering to enhance and improve the attractiveness of Australia&rsquo;s public markets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On 26 February 2025, ASIC released a discussion paper which explored the changing dynamics in capital markets in Australia and abroad, including declining listings on public markets, the rapid growth in investment capital allocated to private markets and the growing significance of superannuation funds in markets.</p>
<h2>Trial process</h2>
<p>The trial process is available to entities seeking the ASX fast-track listing (Eligible Entities / Eligible Companies) as part of a two-year trial starting today. ASX Fast-track is available to entities that will have a market capitalisation greater than $100 million upon listing and no ASX imposed escrow.</p>
<p>Eligible Entities can provide a pathfinder prospectus or pathfinder PDS to ASIC on a confidential basis, at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement for review. A pathfinder prospectus or PDS is a draft document distributed to professional or sophisticated investors which does not seek subscriptions from retail investors and is designed to facilitate the pricing of securities.</p>
<p>ASIC will endeavour to complete its review of the Pathfinder in the 14-day period prior to formal lodgement. ASIC will then generally not need to extend the 7-day exposure period to 14 days after lodgement other than where material new information comes to light or is included in the lodged prospectus / PDS. ASIC will retain its ability to use stop orders up until listing.</p>
<h2>Conditions of trial</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entity must be eligible for the ASX Fast Track application process.</li>
<li>Entities must email the Pathfinder to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:prelodgement@asic.gov.au">prelodgement@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement.</li>
<li>The Pathfinder must not differ in any material respect from the lodged prospectus / PDS other than for final pricing, offer amount and related metrics / financial information and as otherwise agreed with ASIC.</li>
<li>Normal ASIC review processes may apply in situations where there is an extended delay between the informal review completing and formal lodgement.</li>
<li>A Pathfinder review by ASIC does not endorse the contents of the Pathfinder or preclude ASIC or a third party from taking action in respect of the lodged prospectus / PDS or the offer it contains.</li>
<li>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the trial at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ASIC no-action position</h2>
<p>ASIC is also announcing a class no-action position where an Eligible Company accepts an application during the exposure period. This aligns the process for prospectuses with PDSs, simplifying the process by removing the need to wait for the exposure period to lapse.</p>
<p>ASIC does not intend to take action for a contravention of subsections 727(3) or (6) of the Corporations Act where a person accepts an application for non-quoted securities offered under a disclosure document during the period referred to in subsection 727(3) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s no-action position applies only to the offers of non-quoted securities under a disclosure document issued by an Eligible Company in accordance with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act made during the trial period.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s general policy on &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; positions also applies. Their status is set out in Regulatory Guide 108&nbsp;<em>No-action letters</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-108-no-action-letters/" title="RG 108 No-action letters">RG 108</a>). In particular, it should be noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>a no-action letter is an expression of regulatory intention about how to exercise ASIC&rsquo;s powers. The purpose of a no-action letter is to provide an indication as to the future regulatory action that we might take. Entities do not need to apply to ASIC to avail themselves of this no-action position.</li>
<li>an ASIC no-action letter does not necessarily preclude third parties (including the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions) from taking legal action in relation to the same conduct or conduct of that kind. Nor does it prevent a court from holding that particular conduct infringes the relevant legislation. ASIC does not represent that the conduct covered by the no-action letter will not be held to contravene the relevant legislation. Nor does ASIC undertake to intervene in an action brought by third parties in respect of such conduct.</li>
<li>a no-action letter is not a guarantee that ASIC will not take action in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position during the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position at any time.</p>

<p>Global financial markets continued their upward momentum in May 2025, fueled by the evolving landscape of White House tariff policies.

<title>Remarks At The Roundtable On DeFi And The American Spirit, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the panelists and attendees today for the Commission&rsquo;s fifth roundtable organized by the Crypto Task Force, entitled &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Reflecting on the &ldquo;American Spirit&rdquo; brings to mind the expedition of Merriweather Lewis and William Clark. About 220 years ago on May 14, 1804, Lewis and Clark set out to explore the new Louisiana Territory, purchased the prior year by President Thomas Jefferson.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The size of the United States had doubled overnight, but there were no reliable maps or established routes through the new land. Despite this daunting challenge, Lewis and Clark entered the wilderness to carry out their mission.</p>
<p>While perhaps not nearly as fraught with personal danger, the Commission is similarly navigating through challenging new terrain and plunging into the regulatory wilderness under the leadership of Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force. While the Commission&rsquo;s tools &ndash; such as roundtables, public consultation, and economic analysis &ndash; may be different, I am confident that our expedition can succeed in updating our rulebook to open up new opportunities for American investors and businesses.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s treatment of decentralized finance and other emerging technologies over the past four years was not conducive to regulatory transparency and discouraged entrepreneurs and those developing DeFi from engaging with the Commission. However, that approach has recently changed under the Crypto Task Force, which is charged with coordinating the Commission&rsquo;s effort to find answers to many pressing questions. Thus far, they have changed the SEC&rsquo;s posture on crypto, embraced difficult regulatory questions, and promoted transparency by engaging with the market participants driving innovation and change.</p>
<p>This SEC is committed to high quality regulation. High quality regulation takes time and administrative processes matter. For those who are involved in the development of DeFi, please be patient and work with the Commission and its staff towards achieving the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Although I am uncertain as to what &ldquo;perfect regulation&rdquo; may look like, the path towards it begins with seeking input from the public. This journey towards regulatory clarity will likely be frustrating, and may move in fits and starts. However, by learning from DeFi innovators and advocates, the Commission has a better chance at regulating securities transactions involving DeFi and protecting American investors who utilize decentralized financial services and products.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s participants will provide knowledge and insight about DeFi&rsquo;s development and the existing regulatory barriers preventing growth. Such contributions will help the Commission attempt to strike the proper balance between its role as a regulator and its mandate to foster competition, efficiency, and capital formation.</p>
<p>In DeFi, there is a new landscape of opportunities. People can transact directly with each other without relying on banks or other centralized intermediaries. The Commission should not refrain from engaging in oversight of novel areas simply because it involves thinking outside the existing framework.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The legacy regulatory regime under the federal securities laws presupposes the existence and necessity of numerous intermediaries. I look forward to hearing from today&rsquo;s panelists as to whether such presumptions remain necessary.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>In which types of situations do DeFi systems and smart contracts potentially eliminate the need for a financial intermediary and how?</li>
<li>In what situations should DeFi systems be deemed to fall outside the scope of the securities laws?</li>
<li>What key safeguards are necessary when the securities laws apply to these arrangements?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s journey took time to complete and carved out an important path to facilitate westward expansion. In so doing, they provided a valuable contribution to American progress. Today&rsquo;s roundtable reflects the SEC&rsquo;s commitment to continued progress and its willingness to consider the role of emerging technologies. As the Commission continues to move through the regulatory wilderness, it should remain true to its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation in its efforts to respond to market innovation.</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to the conversation.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Final Crypto Task Force Roundtable: Where We Go From Here, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. As we begin the final event of this Crypto Task Force series, I think this is a good opportunity to reflect on what has come out of these roundtables and where the Task Force, and the Commission, are going from here.</p>
<p>These roundtables have highlighted that &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; is far from a monolith. We have heard a markedly diverse set of viewpoints, from many different segments of the industry.</p>
<p>We have heard, for example, from many non-SEC registered entities with varying views on whether they or their products should be required to register and be subject to SEC jurisdiction. I expect that this will be a key theme of today&rsquo;s DeFi panel. Back in November 2021, I wrote an article<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;detailing my views on the opportunities and challenges of DeFi, which I believe require industry and regulatory collaboration to develop compliant solutions. The issues I raised in that article related to market structure, transparency, and retail investor protection, among others, still remain questions today, so I look forward to hearing the panelists&rsquo; views on how we should approach these challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond issues related to registration and jurisdictional lines, other roundtables have focused on current SEC registrants who want to continue operating under SEC oversight, but with altered regulatory requirements tailored to new types of products and technologies.</p>
<p>In addition to these varied and sometimes competing regulatory views, we have heard different opinions on the technologies underlying digital asset products and services. We have heard panelists highlight advantages or disadvantages of particular technologies, and give differing predictions on their capabilities to function effectively as part of a large, complex securities market.</p>
<p>In sum, these roundtables have given us a lot to grapple with, to say the least. While the series was billed as a &ldquo;spring sprint towards crypto clarity,&rdquo; I am unsure whether we&rsquo;ve identified much that can be simply or quickly clarified. When it comes to crypto, it does not appear to me that the SEC is facing problems with ready or easy solutions. What we are facing is heightened expectations of rolling out major changes &mdash;quickly&mdash; to pave the way for crypto expansion into the capital markets.</p>
<p>With issues this complex and stakes this high, it&rsquo;s better to do it right than fast. We need to grapple with the tough questions through the legally sanctioned process of formal rulemaking, as Chairman Atkins alluded to earlier, with full opportunity for notice and comment and public interest findings. I look forward to engaging with my fellow Commissioners, the staff, and the public on what I hope will be a thoughtful and mission-driven rulemaking process for this space. Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins, Commissioner Crenshaw, and Commissioner Uyeda, and thank you all for joining us in-person or online for the final afternoon of the Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s Spring Sprint roundtable series: &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you especially to our moderator, Troy Paredes, who is returning after his excellent performance at our first roundtable back in March. Troy, we are grateful to have you here again as we wrap up. I also appreciate today&rsquo;s panelists for being part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Over the past four months, the Task Force has held roundtables on security status, trading, tokenization, and custody.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These roundtables have provided invaluable input to the Commission, the Task Force, and the rest of the Commission staff&mdash;input that has informed our views and improved our efforts. The Task Force, which hit the ground running in a sprint of roundtables, intends to keep running the clarity marathon, and the perspectives of roundtable participants will help determine the course.</p>
<p>Our final roundtable is on DeFi, or decentralized finance. You may ask: What business does the SEC have in talking about regulating DeFi? Absolutely none is a reasonable answer, so with that, we will wrap up this roundtable: Thank you everyone for attending! OK, not so fast. Life is not that simple. Even getting to&nbsp;<i>no</i>&nbsp;regulation requires some talking.</p>
<p>What is DeFi? Bitcoin is &ldquo;decentralized finance,&rdquo; but it may not be what first comes to mind when we think of DeFi. Google says DeFi is &ldquo;a blockchain-based financial system that aims to replace traditional financial institutions with peer-to-peer transactions and smart contracts.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;DeFi brings to mind decentralized networks, which enable people to trade tokens and derivatives, engage in lending, or participate in prediction markets. Although sometimes referred to as DeFi &ldquo;platforms,&rdquo; DeFi is not a&nbsp;<i>place</i>&nbsp;people go to access services that someone else provides and controls; it is software code that people use to engage in the activity of transacting without a centralized intermediary. To channel one of today&rsquo;s panelists, I do not go to a decentralized exchange; I make a decentralized exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>DeFi defies our traditional, permissioned world of intermediaries. It enables a person to engage with her peers through a protocol that is open to everybody on the same transparent terms: no need to get consent from any centralized gatekeeper. At its core, DeFi, which blockchain technology enables, is about the freedom to transact with your peers without permission, interference, or intermediation. And that is why DeFi resonates so deeply with the American spirit.</p>
<p>Also resonant with the American spirit is the ability of people to publish written material without permission. Code is protected speech. Because the First Amendment protects someone who writes a DeFi software protocol and publishes it, the SEC has no authority to demand pre-publication approval rights even for code that could be used to exchange securities. The SEC must not infringe on First Amendment rights by regulating someone who merely publishes code on the basis that others use that code to carry out activity that the SEC has traditionally regulated. If somebody else subsequently violates the law using the software protocol, the user&mdash;not the developer of the software&mdash;should face the music.</p>
<p>But sometimes the writer of a protocol used to exchange securities does more than merely publish it. She also might operate, administer, or maintain a platform through which the code can be accessed and that takes custody of client assets or makes execution decisions for clients. In this and other instances, the coder or her platform might be subject to regulation for that conduct. If that conduct relates to securities, the SEC might have a role to play.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Centralized entities that use DeFi protocols that someone else wrote to serve clients do not get a regulatory pass either. Nor can centralized entities avoid regulation by hiding behind a &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; label; that is DINO, or DeFi-In-Name-Only.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;With centralized entities comes the potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, principal-agent problems, information asymmetries, and other issues common in the traditional finance world&mdash;all the issues DeFi is designed to address. The SEC&rsquo;s efforts are best spent protecting investors, not from their own use of open-source software code to engage in transactions with their peers, nor from writers of such code, but from providers of financial services.</p>
<p>I hope that today&rsquo;s discussion will help us ensure that SEC regulation is able to reach activities and entities properly within its ambit regardless of what label they bear, without prohibiting the exercise of individuals&rsquo; rights to publish code and interact with that code. I now will hand it off to Troy. Thank you all for being here, and I look forward to the discussion.</p>

Coburn was the only person with the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract, as he was the only person with access to the private key for the administrator account, which could be used to change the permissible fees for transacting using EtherDelta or the address of the account to which those fees were directed. The order book sat on a centralized server that was maintained by EtherDelta, rather than on the Ethereum Blockchain. https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2018/34-84553.pdf</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood today released a letter in response to correspondence from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors requesting the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) rescind its preemption regulations.</p>
<p>In the letter, Acting Comptroller Hood reaffirmed the OCC&rsquo;s support and defense of preemption as a cornerstone of the dual banking system that is fundamental to the operation of the federal banking system. The OCC&rsquo;s preemption regulations are consistent with federal law, Supreme Court precedent, and a powerful enabler of local and national prosperity and growth.</p>

<title>US Financial Groups Urge Administration To Address Pattern Of Data Security Lapses At Regulators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, MFA and SIFMA called for significant reforms to how federal financial regulators handle sensitive data following the latest in a series of data breaches that exposed over 148,000 private correspondences containing sensitive supervisory information about U.S. financial institutions. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/data-security-joint-trades/">letter</a>&nbsp;addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the organizations identified concerns with regulators&rsquo; data management practices spanning the previous administration. Weaknesses were identified in February 2025; however, growing threats from hostile nation-states targeting U.S. critical infrastructure serve as a reminder of the urgency to address vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[G]overnment agencies are increasingly the target of persistent and sophisticated nation-state attacks that could disrupt financial markets and our economy,&rdquo; the organizations wrote. &ldquo;It is imperative that federal regulators recognize that they are equally a target of malicious actors and implement the same or substantially similar cybersecurity and incident response practices that they expect financial institutions to maintain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Financial institutions are legally required to share sensitive, proprietary and non-public information with their regulators as part of the supervisory process. This information can range from capital and liquidity management to cybersecurity protocols. However, centralizing large amounts of data can create a prime target for illicit actors seeking to harm U.S. economic security. Government agencies, including regulatory agencies, are increasingly the target of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, both the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency &mdash; the Treasury bureau responsible for supervising the U.S. banking system &mdash; have suffered significant cyber incidents. The latest dates back to 2023 and was identified in early 2025. Here are the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackers compromised the OCC&rsquo;s systems in May 2023.</li>
<li>The OCC did not learn of the suspicious activity until February 2025 &mdash; meaning, hackers likely had access to the OCC&rsquo;s systems for over a year and a half.</li>
<li>The breach exposed an estimated 148,000 emails, some of which may have contained highly sensitive supervisory information that could give hostile nation states ample information to harm America&rsquo;s financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These weaknesses point to a pattern of problems in how U.S. agencies secure data and are held accountable. To mitigate risk and prevent similar problems in the future, the groups made four recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold agencies to the same security and data protection standards as private companies.</li>
<li>Avoid centralizing sensitive data that could affect entire economic sectors and instead allow companies to maintain control and access to their data.</li>
<li>Require regulatory agencies to notify affected companies when things go wrong.</li>
<li>Limit data collection to only what is necessary.</li>
</ol>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you and good afternoon.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is a great pleasure to be with you today. Let me begin by thanking Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force for their organizing today&rsquo;s event, and Commissioner Crenshaw and Commissioner Uyeda for their participation.&nbsp; Of course, I very much thank the roundtable panelists and our moderator, Troy Parades, for their voluntary contribution of time and talent to our endeavor.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s roundtable is titled &ldquo;DeFi and&nbsp;<i>the American Spirit</i>.&rdquo; This is an apt title because the American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, movement.</p>
<p>Blockchains, of course, are a very creative and potentially revolutionary innovation that have us rethinking evidence of ownership and transfer of intellectual and economic property rights.&nbsp; They are shared databases that enable ownership of a type of digital property called crypto assets without reliance on an intermediary or central party. Instead, these peer-to-peer networks incorporate an economic mechanism to encourage participants to validate and maintain the database in accordance with the network&rsquo;s rules. These are free market systems where users pay demand-based fees to network participants to have their transactions included within a so-called &ldquo;block&rdquo; of data with finite storage capacity.</p>
<p>The prior U.S. government administration discouraged Americans from participating in these market-based systems by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions. I am grateful to the Division of Corporation Finance staff for clarifying its view that voluntary participation in a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake network as a &ldquo;miner,&rdquo; &ldquo;validator,&rdquo; or &ldquo;staking-as-a-service&rdquo; provider is not within the scope of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; As happy as I am over that step, it is not a duly promulgated rule with the force of law, so we cannot stop there.&nbsp; The Securities and Exchange Commission must adopt a regulation based on the authority that Congress has given us.</p>
<p>Another core feature of blockchain technology is the ability for individuals to have self-custody of crypto assets in a personal digital wallet. The right to have self-custody of one&rsquo;s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet. I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially where intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.</p>
<p>The prior President&rsquo;s administration undermined innovation in self-custodial digital wallets and other on-chain technologies by asserting through regulatory actions that the developers of such software may be conducting brokerage activity. Engineers should not be subject to the federal securities laws solely for publishing this type of software code. As one court put it, it would be irrational to hold the developer of a self-driving car liable &ndash; here, quoting from the court&rsquo;s decision &ndash; &ldquo;for a third-party&rsquo;s use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank. In those circumstances, one would not sue the car company for facilitating the wrongdoing; they would sue the individual who committed the wrong.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are developing software applications that are designed to function without administration by any operator. The idea of self-executing software code that is accessible to everyone, but controlled by no one, and that enables private, peer-to-peer transactions may sound like science fiction. But, blockchain technology makes possible an entirely new class of software that can perform these functions without an intermediary. I do not believe that we should allow century-old regulatory frameworks to stifle innovation with technologies that could upend and most importantly improve and advance our current, traditional intermediated model.&nbsp; We should not automatically fear the future.</p>
<p>These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises. While centralized platforms waivered and failed under recent stresses, many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Most current securities rules and regulations are premised upon the regulation of issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries. I have asked the Commission staff to explore whether further guidance or rulemaking may be helpful for enabling registrants to transact with these software systems in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>I also am excited about the use of on-chain software systems by issuers and intermediaries to eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity. Current securities regulations already contemplate the use of new technologies by issuers and intermediaries, but I have asked the staff to consider whether amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules and regulations would be better suited to provide needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries who seek to administer on-chain financial systems.</p>
<p>While the Commission and its staff work to propose fit-for-purpose rules of the road for on-chain financial markets, I have directed the staff to consider a conditional exemptive relief framework or &ldquo;innovation exemption&rdquo; that would expeditiously allow registrants and non-registrants to bring on-chain products and services to market. An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump&rsquo;s vision to make America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the planet&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with to certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the discussions to follow.</p>
