<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information and Health, Mr Tan Kiat How,<br /><br />Chongqing Municipal People&rsquo;s Government Vice Mayor Xu Jian,<br /><br />His Excellency, Ambassador Cao Zhongming,<br /><br />Bank Indonesia Executive Director Pak Yoga Affandi,<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen,<br /><br />1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Singapore for the CCI-ILSTC Trade and Financial Conference. Today&rsquo;s Conference is especially meaningful for three reasons.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>First, it marks the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative or CCI. The value of the CCI as an important driver for cross-border connectivity cannot be understated. Since the CCI&rsquo;s inception, there has been sustained growth in trade volumes in both directions. And finance has been an important driver, with over US$21.69 billion in cross-border financing deals since the CCI&rsquo;s inception.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>Second, the Conference reflects strong interest and active participation of financial institutions from both sides, working hard on new areas to explore partnerships, and work on cross-border financing deals together. All this is taking place against the backdrop of expanding financial collaboration at the China-Singapore Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation which covers RMB cooperation, capital market connectivity, as well as digital and sustainable finance.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>Third, this Conference brings together, for the first time, the CCI Financial Summit and the CCI-ILSTC International Cooperation Forum. This new format seeks to bring our financial services and trade ecosystems even closer together, more effectively catalysing the discovery of new linkages and business opportunities. This is timely as ASEAN is also Chongqing&rsquo;s largest trading partner accounting for more than 16% of Chongqing&rsquo;s total trade.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;<span> </span>As CCI enters its next decade, we look to how Western China and ASEAN can deepen cooperation, harness key structural trends, and identify new opportunities in future-oriented areas such as green finance and digital connectivity. This will improve the quality and scope of cross-border financial services, enabling our financial sectors to better serve the real economy. In doing so, financial institutions can also help businesses with their green transition efforts and capitalise on digitalisation trends to enhance their business models.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span>Both China and ASEAN will require a vast amount of green financing and investments to transition our economies towards a sustainable, low carbon future.&nbsp;<br /><br />7.&nbsp;<span> </span>Banks from China and Singapore, together with the Singapore Exchange, have been engaging Chongqing corporates on green financing opportunities. For instance, last year, the EU, China and Singapore announced the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy, or M-CGT which enhances the comparability of green taxonomies across the EU, China and Singapore. With the M-CGT, corporates from the three regions will benefit from a common framework which aligns their green activities with international standards, making it easier to access cross-border green financing.&nbsp;<br /><br />8.&nbsp;<span> </span>Aside from capital markets, our financial institutions have also been active in supporting Chongqing&rsquo;s decarbonisation journey. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DBS Bank&rsquo;s provision of a green loan to Singapore Power Group in 2025, to support the district cooling and heating system project at Raffles City Chongqing. This will reduce its carbon footprint by about 30 percent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>OCBC Bank&rsquo;s arranging of a green syndicated loan for EBA Investments<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/opening-remarks-by-mr-leong-sing-chiong-at-the-cci-ilstc-conference#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;in 2024, for their Chongqing IMIX+ Project in the Chaotianmen Business District. This loan, which references internationally recognised Green Loan Principles, helps promote carbon neutrality for the project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span> </span>Meanwhile, digital technology has great potential to break down barriers and make cross-border trade simpler, more efficient, and potentially enhance SME trade connectivity between China and ASEAN.&nbsp;As SMS Tan mentioned in his remarks earlier, Proxtera's network of digital marketplaces will enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Chongqing and the Western Region to access a greater network of buyers and suppliers. The integration of trade discoverability and financing functions on the Proxtera platform can also help these SMEs overcome some of the challenges and complexities of cross-border trade as they seek to access new markets.<br /><br />10.&nbsp;<span> </span>In closing, there is much potential to further grow the trade and financial connectivity between Chongqing and ASEAN. Under the umbrella of the CCI, we hope to bring new ideas, innovations and initiatives that will ensure sustainable growth across our regions. This is in keeping with the JCBC objective of fostering an all-round, high-quality, future-oriented partnership.<br /><br />11.&nbsp;<span> </span>Thanks, and I wish you all a fruitful Conference for the rest of the day.</p>

<title>Opening Remarks At The ASIC Symposium On Australia’s Public And Private Markets, Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo, 10 June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The future direction of our public and private markets affects almost every Australian &ndash; and will undoubtedly help shape our economy.</li>
<li>We have a window of opportunity to design the public markets we want to see &ndash; and grease the wheels a bit to get public listings moving.</li>
<li>At the same time, we are at a turning point that could alter the trajectory of private markets to instil further market integrity and confidence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Good evening, everyone. It&rsquo;s good to see the room just about full.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you to ASIC&rsquo;s Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s Public and Private Markets and acknowledge all of our guests. This is the second symposium ASIC is doing, and I hope it will be a permanent feature of our work. Some of you might remember last year we did a symposium on AI &ndash; a subject we&rsquo;ll no doubt have to return to at some point.</p>
<p>Tonight, you&rsquo;ll be hearing from market participants interacting directly with ASIC to answer a very significant question &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>where do we go from here</strong>?</p>
<p>This question affects almost every Australian. Every worker saving for their future retirement. Every mum-and-dad investor trying to get ahead. And every entrepreneur with the next great idea.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s role in this discussion</h2>
<p>On that, many of our conversations have focused on whether ASIC has a role in regulating private markets. I want to be clear that ASIC is in no rush to regulate.</p>
<p>The intent of this work has always been to sharpen our understanding of private markets. The very significant capital in this part of the system is made up of Australians&rsquo; superannuation and insurance monies, so quite frankly it is in the public interest that ASIC take a closer look and lead the debate.</p>
<p>So far what we have heard is that there is an openness to increased supervision and consistent standard-setting across areas like valuations, managing conflicts of interest and fee disclosure.</p>
<p>But fundamentally we need to be very clear about the problem we are solving before jumping to regulation. I&rsquo;ve said many times before regulatory complexity is a problem in Australia, and we need to simplify our approach.</p>
<h2>Today ASIC is moving from listening mode to action mode</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that as a result of our consultation, there are many actionable ideas on the table.</p>
<p>Ideas to help make our markets more open, more accessible, and more attractive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now looking at which ones we can bring to the front burner to fuel growth and activity in our markets. We&rsquo;re moving from listening to action.</p>
<p>This morning&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/" title="25-096MR ASIC clears path for faster IPOs">announcement about changes to the IPO process</a>&nbsp;is an example &ndash; and I hope the beginning of several more.</p>
<p>This change reflects feedback that while our regulatory guardrails are sound, it&rsquo;s time to grease the wheels a bit to get public listings moving.</p>
<p>So, we are creating a more streamlined IPO process which reduces the execution risks associated with listing.</p>
<p>The trial will commence immediately, and I&rsquo;m pleased to say we&rsquo;ve already received enquiries from interested parties.</p>
<p>While regulatory settings aren&rsquo;t a silver bullet, I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to mobilise our teams on simple, common-sense solutions supported by industry &ndash; and there&rsquo;ll be more to come.</p>
<p>I should call out, by the way, the various people in the market who worked so closely with ASIC to get us to where we were this morning. There&rsquo;s a lot of goodwill and professionalism reflected in that engagement.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage and work with industry, Treasury, our peers at other Australian regulators &ndash; some of whom are here tonight &ndash; and broader stakeholders.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to next steps, we&rsquo;ll share our views on how to strengthen our public markets during quarter three of this year.</p>
<p>And in quarter four we&rsquo;ll announce our proposed roadmap for private markets.</p>
<p>This work will be supported in the coming months by our ongoing surveillances, views from market experts and ongoing stakeholder feedback.</p>
<p>To wrap up.</p>
<p>While many of the responses to our discussion paper focused on the here and now, it is critical that we keep an eye on the medium to longer term horizon.</p>
<p>This could be a watershed moment for Australia&rsquo;s markets.</p>
<p>We have a window of opportunity to design the public markets we want to see, not just tomorrow but in five- and 10-years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re at a turning point that could alter the trajectory of private markets to instil further market integrity and confidence.</p>
<p>From here on, our work must look ahead.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a modern, confident, ambitious regulator, ASIC is proud to be leading these issues of the day which will undoubtedly help shape Australia&rsquo;s economy, so that it is fit for the future.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to this evening&rsquo;s discussions. Thank you.</p>

<title>EACH Calls For An SIU That Further Strengthens Capital Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Association of CCP Clearing Houses (EACH) calls for a EU Savings and Investment Union (SIU) that further strengthens capital markets. EACH Members would like to underline the following key messages included in the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eachccp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EACH-Response-Commission-targeted-consultation-on-EU-capital-markets-integration.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">response</a>&nbsp;to the European Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations-0/targeted-consultation-integration-eu-capital-markets-2025_en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consultation</a>&nbsp;on the Savings and Investment Union (SIU):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Supervision</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members point out that the EMIR 3<sup>&nbsp;</sup>supervisory system for CCPs came into force relatively recently in December 2024. It is therefore still being tested at this initial stage of application and it may be too early to objectively analyse its implications. Nevertheless, there is a majority support within the EACH Membership in favour of a more centralised supervision for CCPs in the EU to different degrees, although certain CCPs have expressed support towards the EMIR 3 status quo. EACH Members would also like to caution against models such as regional supervisory hubs or establishing supervisory colleges with enhanced powers.</li>
<li><b>Recommendations on possible streamlining and simplification of EU law</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH supports removing overlapping reporting requirements between different legislations such as EMIR, REMIT, MAR, MiFID and MiFIR, as well as ensuring a level playing field between EU and non-EU CCPs and non-centrally cleared markets, especially in the context of requirements concerning e.g. anti-procyclicality and margin transparency. EACH also calls for the implementation of the appropriate measures to incentivise clearing by fund managers, insurers and public entities, as well as a reflection on how the principle of proportionality is applied in the context of the DORA framework. Furthermore, Members put forward detailed proposals linked to the ESMA Draft RTS on EMIR 3 approval procedures, underlining the need for leaner and clearer processes.</li>
<li><b>Lowering barriers in post-trading</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members propose to create incentives for the missing Member States and market participants to migrate flows to T2S. Furthermore, we suggest a series of changes to the SFD and FCD legislations to address specific issues concerning the clearing sector such as need to ensure protection under the SFD for all CCPs/clearing houses for their default management rules and procedures, as well as the necessity to expand the list of collateral eligible under the FCD to cover all assets acceptable as collateral.</li>
<li><b>Outsourcing and DLT</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH calls for a clear guidance based on existing rules in the context of outsourcing, and provides an analysis of the advantages and drawbacks&nbsp;regarding the use of DLT in the clearing sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, pending the crucial final publication of the ESMA RTS about the approval procedures for products and changes to risk models, the EMIR 3 level 1 text has represented a major step forward in reducing unnecessary regulatory burden for the market while maintaining financial stability safeguards. The SIU project may be inspired by the achievements of the EMIR 3 level 1 text.</p>

<title>ISDA: Creating Value – IQ June 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-creating-value-iq-june-2025-2025610/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-creating-value-iq-june-2025-2025610/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ever since its establishment 40 years ago, ISDA has worked to enhance the safety and efficiency of derivatives markets. That has motivated everything we do &ndash; from the development of standard documentation and the rollout of new digital solutions to our responses to regulatory consultations.</p>
<p>In our view, safe and efficient markets are critical prerequisites for liquidity and competition &ndash; and that matters. Without deep and liquid markets, it would be more difficult and expensive for corporations, governments, pension funds and insurance companies to use derivatives to transfer unwanted risks, enhance returns and manage their liquidity needs.</p>
<p>The impact of that would be significant. According to a new ISDA report on the value of derivatives, 87.1% of nearly 1,200 major companies in seven major stock indices use over-the-counter derivatives for a variety of reasons, including locking in financing terms, reducing costs and enhancing financial performance. This helps create predictability, which gives companies the<br />confidence to borrow, invest and hire.</p>
<p>In this issue of IQ, we spotlight that report and explore how and why different types of firms use derivatives and the value they bring to individual companies and the broader economy.</p>
<p>The report was published to coincide with ISDA&rsquo;s 40th anniversary, and we continue our&nbsp;<span>IQ</span>&nbsp;anniversary series by looking at how ISDA and its members have worked to address some of the biggest challenges ever to face derivatives markets &ndash; from the rollout of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives to the transition from LIBOR. The solutions that were developed &ndash; the ISDA<br />Standard Initial Margin Model and the IBOR fallbacks &ndash; are great examples of ISDA fulfilling its core mission: maintaining the safety and efficiency of derivatives markets.</p>
<p>This issue also includes a review of ISDA&rsquo;s 39th Annual General Meeting, which took place in Amsterdam last month, with nearly 800 delegates from around the world. The flagship event was an opportunity to reflect on ISDA&rsquo;s achievements over the past 40 years and to consider the future trends that will shape the derivatives market. Save the date for ISDA&rsquo;s 40th AGM, which will take place in Boston on April 28-30, 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4445469-1&amp;h=966934093&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2F24exchange.com%2F&amp;a=24+Exchange" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">24 Exchange</a>&nbsp;announced today that the first stage of&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4445469-1&amp;h=339402676&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fequities.24exchange.com%2F&amp;a=24X+National+Exchange" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">24X National Exchange</a>&nbsp;(the "Exchange") will launch on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 29, 2025</span>. This milestone marks the debut of the first national securities exchange designed for global access and approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer 23-hour weekday trading of U.S. equities.</p>
<p>Beginning on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 29</span>, 24X National Exchange will offer trading of U.S. equities from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET</span>&nbsp;on weekdays.</p>
<p>The new Exchange will enable both institutional and retail investors anywhere in the world to trade U.S. equities via participating broker-dealers across nearly the entire day, five days a week. It will operate under full SEC regulatory oversight and with all the standard investor protections afforded to national exchanges.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange will focus its initial efforts on meeting the growing demand for overnight trading in U.S. equities among tech savvy retail investors throughout the APAC region.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange CEO and Founder&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Dmitri Galinov</span>&nbsp;said: "We're proud to lead the next chapter in exchange evolution as we bring extended hours trading to retail traders around the world. With this first stage launch, we're one big step closer to making 23-hour weekday trading a reality for U.S. equities worldwide. 24X National Exchange will enable unprecedented access, flexibility, and speed for market participants in every global location whenever they want to trade.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange received SEC approval last November to operate 23/5 trading hours, subject to the implementation of necessary modifications to Equity Data Plans and a subsequent rule filing with the SEC confirming compliance with the Securities Exchange Act.</p>
<p>Pending final approvals and market infrastructure alignment, 24X National Exchange will transition to operating from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday</span>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">8:00 p.m. ET on Friday</span>, with a one-hour daily operational pause for software maintenance and testing. The launch date for the Exchange's second stage will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>"The initial launch of 24X National Exchange is the culmination of years of innovation, regulatory engagement, and commitment to global market access," Galinov added. "Setting the launch date for our new Exchange is a defining moment &ndash; not just for our company, but for the future of U.S. equity trading."</p>
<p>24X National Exchange is built on a robust, high-performance technology infrastructure powered by MEMX Technologies, ensuring a seamless, resilient, and cost-effective trading experience.</p>
<p>Like NYSE and NASDAQ, 24X National Exchange will observe U.S. market holidays.</p>

<title>FTSE Russell And StepStone Announce Proposed Partnership</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, an LSEG business, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stepstonegroup.com/">StepStone</a>&nbsp;announced today they have signed a proposed partnership to jointly develop private asset indices, data, and analytics products.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>The proposed partnership will combine FTSE Russell&rsquo;s expertise in design, development, calculation and management&nbsp;of category defining indices across asset classes, with StepStone&rsquo;s leading private markets solutions platform and deep data driven insights across multiple private market asset classes.</p>
<p>The partnership encompasses the development and delivery of market leading reference indices for a full spectrum of private asset allocations, allowing asset owners to better benchmark the performance of private markets portfolios within a total &ldquo;real return&rdquo; portfolio view and asset managers to develop products tracking these daily indices.</p>
<p>FTSE Russell and StepStone expect the initial cohort of daily indices to be launched this year, with further indices and supporting analytical tools to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Fiona Bassett, CEO, FTSE Russell, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our agreement with StepStone and its intended delivery of private asset indices and benchmarking tools further strengthens FTSE Russell&rsquo;s position as a leading multi-asset class index and benchmark provider. With the continued growth in private asset allocation and growing client demand, it is essential for us not only to deliver leading indices in this asset class but to work with partners aligned to our commitment to transparency, rules-based methodologies, robust data provenance and investability. With StepStone&rsquo;s broad, in-depth private markets dataset, we have chosen a great partner with which to build this offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mike McCabe, Head of Strategy, StepStone, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As private markets have become more meaningful components of investors&rsquo; portfolios, the need for integrating views of risk and return across the total portfolio has become critical for investment decision makers.&nbsp; With a growing portion of the global economy remaining private not only for longer, but potentially indefinitely, we need to pave a pathway for further easing the access to differentiated sources of investment returns.&nbsp; Partnering with FTSE Russell will unleash the power and scale of our private markets data &ndash; contained within our proprietary technology platform, SPI by StepStone &ndash; to drive these goals forward.&nbsp; FTSE Russell&rsquo;s leading index, benchmarking and technology platform underpinned by its client-centered approach gives us confidence that in partnering we can deliver a solution that is consistent with our mission to be the trusted partner of choice in private markets solutions globally.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announces that Mr. Kevin Carmichael has been sentenced to four years in jail for defrauding investors in Strike Holdings Inc., as well as making misleading statements to investors and trading securities without registration. In addition to the jail term, Mr. Carmichael was also ordered to pay restitution to harmed investors totaling $22.7 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael was a director and officer of both Strike Holdings and a related company, KM Strike Management (KMSM). He entered a guilty plea in the Ontario Court of Justice on January 8, 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carmichael&rsquo;s actions had a profound impact on investors, creating stress and hardship in the lives of hard-working people who put their trust in him,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President, Enforcement, at the OSC. &ldquo;Misleading investors through falsified reports is illegal, and the OSC will continue to take action to protect investors, and the integrity of our capital markets. We also want to thank the Halton Region Police Service for their support on this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael was co-accused with Michael Aonso, the other director and officer of Strike Holdings and KMSM. Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Aonso were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/michael-aonso-and-kevin-carmichael-charged-securities-act-offences">charged in March 2022</a>. Mr. Aonso pleaded guilty in November 2024 to unregistered trading and illegal distribution of securities.

<h4>Background:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In June 2019, knowing Strike&rsquo;s TD accounts held only about USD $230,000, Carmichael approached TD Bank and claimed Strike had USD $97M on deposit. He provided forged statements to TD Bank in support of the claim that TD had lost the funds through fraud or error. In early 2021, Strike raised over $900,000 by issuing a debenture to fund litigation against TD Bank to &ldquo;recover&rdquo; the $97M. Carmichael participated in the debenture raise knowing he had forged the documents on which the proposed litigation was based.</li>

<title>EBA Publishes No Action Letter On The Interplay Between Payment Services Directive (PSD2/3) And Markets In Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a&nbsp;No Action letter advising the EU Commission, EU Council and EU Parliament to ensure that, in the long term, EU law needs to avoid a dual authorisation under two pieces of EU law for the activity of transacting electronic money tokens (EMTs). While the existing Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) still applies, the letter advises national competent authorities (NCAs) to enforce authorisation of PSD2 for a specified subset only of crypto asset service providers (CASPs) that transact EMTs, to do so only after a transition period that ends on 2 March 2026, and then to deprioritise specified PSD2 provisions.</span></p>
<p>The letter assesses the provisions set out in MiCA and PSD2 and advises NCAs under PSD2 to view the transfer of crypto assets as a payment service under PSD2 where they&nbsp;entail EMTs and are carried out by the entities on behalf of their clients. It sets out provisions&nbsp;to regard the custody and administration of EMTs as a payment service and to regard a custodial wallet as a payment account where the wallet is held in the name of one or more clients and allows to send and receive EMTs to and from third parties.</p>
<p>For these services, the No Action letter advises NCAs to require an authorisation under PSD2 only from 2 March 2026 onwards and, during the authorisation process, to apply streamlined procedures that make maximum use of information that legal entities provide during their CASP authorisation process.</p>
<p>Once an authorisation as a payment services provider is held, NCAs are advised not to prioritise the supervision and enforcement of several elements of PSD2, such as safeguarding, the disclosure of information to consumers (pertaining to the level of applicable charges, the maximum execution time of payment transactions, the unique identifier such as IBAN, and open banking). However, NCAs are also advised to insist on the compliance with other PSD2 provisions, such as strong customer authentication (SCA) for&nbsp;accessing custodial wallets that qualify as&nbsp;payment account&nbsp;and the initiating of EMT transfers, the reporting of payment fraud,&nbsp;and the cumulative calculation of own funds requirements. This is to ensure equally high standards of consumer protection regardless of whether a consumer is using EMTs or more traditional funds as a means of payment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, NCAs are advised not to consider as payment services (and therefore not to subject to the application of PSD2, including its provisions on licensing)&nbsp;the &lsquo;exchange of crypto-assets for funds&rsquo; and &lsquo;exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets&rsquo; as defined in MiCA. Additionally,&nbsp;the EBA advises NCAs&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to regard as a payment service cases where&nbsp;crypto-asset service providers intermediate the purchase of any crypto-assets with EMTs, and,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to enforce the application of PSD2 nor to require an authorisation under PSD2 in such cases.</p>
<p>This advice will result in a large number of EMT transactions not&nbsp;being subject to&nbsp;PSD2 requirements during the intervening period while the Directive still applies.&nbsp;The EBA bases this advice solely on the acknowledgement that any alternative advice would require a much larger number of CASPs to obtain a second authorization. The&nbsp;EBA considers such an alternative to be undesirable, given the&nbsp;burden that dual authorisation would impose on CASPs.</p>
<p>By contrast, the EBA does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;base this advice on the conviction that an authorisation as a CASP under MiCA is sufficient to address the risks that arise from EMT transactions. On the contrary, the success of PSD1, PSD2 and EMD over the past 15 years in bringing about a secure and competitive market for payment services in the EU has shown that for retail payments to be able effectively to fulfil their role in a modern society, consumers and other market actors should be adequately protected and have a high degree of confidence in the stability of the market and the reliability of payment transactions.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has issued the letter in response to a request received from the European Commission in December 2024 to address, in close cooperation with ESMA, issues arising from the interplay between MiCA and PSD2.&nbsp;The EBA&rsquo;s competence to deliver the letter in the form of an Opinion is based on Article 9c of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>

<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning five individuals and five sham charities located abroad that are prominent financial supporters of Hamas&rsquo;s Military Wing and its terrorist activities.&nbsp; The individuals and entities sanctioned today are responsible for funding Hamas&rsquo;s Military Wing under the pretense of conducting humanitarian work, both internationally and in Gaza. &nbsp;Treasury is also targeting a separate fraudulent charity linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action underscores the importance of safeguarding the charitable sector from abuse by terrorists like Hamas and the PFLP, who continue to leverage sham charities as fronts for funding their terrorist and military operations,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender</strong>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Treasury will continue to use all available tools to prevent Hamas, the PFLP, and other terrorist actors from exploiting the humanitarian situation in Gaza to fund their violent activities at the expense of their own people.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Today&rsquo;s action, which is being taken pursuant to the counterterrorism authority in Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, highlights the abuse of the nonprofit sector by terrorist financiers to illicitly generate, store, and move funds.&nbsp; The PFLP was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. Department of State in October 1997 and October 2001, respectively. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Natasha Vij Greiner, Director of the Division of Investment Management, will depart the agency effective July 4, 2025, after more than 23 years of public service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natasha&rsquo;s steadfast leadership and strong judgment have been invaluable assets to the SEC throughout her long and distinguished career,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;I am grateful for her strategic counsel since I&rsquo;ve become Chairman. Her unwavering commitment to the agency&rsquo;s mission and her ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes with clarity will have a lasting effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management's work is critical to ensuring that investors have access to high-quality investment opportunities from which they can make well-informed investing decisions. It has primary responsibility for administering the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which includes overseeing investment companies (e.g., mutual funds, closed-end funds, business development companies, unit investment trusts, variable insurance products, and exchange-traded funds) and investment advisers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I reflect on my 23 years at the SEC, I am filled with gratitude for the incredible journey across the divisions of Investment Management, Enforcement, Examinations, and Trading and Markets,&rdquo; said Ms. Greiner. &ldquo;It has been an extraordinary privilege to serve in various capacities at the SEC, culminating as Director of the Division of Investment Management. Throughout my tenure, I have witnessed firsthand the dedication and integrity of the staff that define this remarkable agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Greiner was named Director of the Division of Investment Management in March 2024. She previously served as Deputy Director of the Division of Examinations and as the National Associate Director of the Investment Adviser/Investment Company examination program, which includes the Private Funds Unit, and was the Associate Director of the Home Office IA/IC examination program.</p>
<p>She began her SEC career in the Division of Examinations (formerly OCIE) as a broker-dealer examiner and has served in a variety of roles across the agency, including Acting Chief Counsel and Assistant Chief Counsel in the Division of Trading and Markets, where she provided legal and policy advice to the Commission on rules affecting market participants and the operation of the securities markets. Before that, Ms. Greiner worked in the Division of Enforcement, including in its Asset Management Unit, where she investigated possible violations of the federal securities laws and litigated matters in federal district court and administrative proceedings.</p>
<p>Throughout her career at the SEC, Ms. Greiner has been consistently recognized for her outstanding achievements and efforts. She received the Chairman&rsquo;s Award for Excellence in 2015 and again in 2018, and she received the Chairman&rsquo;s Award for Serving the Interests of Main Street Investors in 2019.</p>
<p>Ms. Greiner received her J.D. from The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law and graduated cum laude with a B.S. degree from James Madison University.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it will immediately resume processing new and pending registration applications of investment advisers with their principal office and place of business in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement follows successful discussions between staff from the SEC and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regarding (1) the ability of FINMA-supervised, SEC-registered investment advisers located in Switzerland to provide their books and records, including personal data, directly to SEC staff, and (2) the SEC&rsquo;s ability to conduct on-site visits of these entities in Switzerland, consistent with the U.S. securities laws and Swiss law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased to announce that the SEC stands ready to provide prompt consideration of the registration applications from Swiss investment advisers. These applications have languished for too many years, and it is well past time that we resume this process,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;Longstanding interest from foreign investment advisers in registration demonstrates the value of the U.S. regulatory framework, and we look forward to expanding access to U.S. capital markets. I thank my FINMA counterparts for their collaboration and welcome their actions to make this possible.&rdquo;</p>

In the last year, the turnover of these companies grew by 6.5%.<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx"></a></p>
<p>The expanding companies, a segment that includes the companies with the highest projection within these markets, have recorded even more notable growth, with an annualized increase of 30.6% in their revenue over the same period.</p>

<h4><b>KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>A weaker US Dollar, stable oil prices, and dovish fiscal policy in China and Europe provides a positive back drop for Emerging Markets</b></li>

<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Pedestrian index returns over the past 15 years underline the importance of investing actively in these markets</b></li>
</ul>
<p>On Thursday 5 June, Aubrey Capital Management (&ldquo;Aubrey&rdquo;) and LarrainVial hosted a high-level investment seminar in London, bringing together investment professionals, economists, policymakers and clients to examine how shifting global power dynamics are reshaping the investment opportunity in Emerging Markets.</p>
<p>The event,&nbsp;<i>Navigating Shifting Narratives in Emerging Markets</i>, featured presentations from Louis-Vincent Gave, Co-Founder and CEO of Gavekal, John Ewart, Investment Manager (Aubrey), Camila Guzm&aacute;n, Portfolio Manager (LarrainVial Asset Management), and former Chilean Finance Minister, Ignacio Briones. The speakers were joined in discussions by Aubrey&rsquo;s Founder and Investment Manager, Andrew Dalrymple, and Fernando Larra&iacute;n C.,<b>&nbsp;</b>President of LarrainVial. Anna Macdonald, Head of Private Clients at Aubrey, moderated the seminar.</p>
<p>Louis-Vincent Gave opened the event by framing 2025 as a year of global inflection, reflecting on the rise of &ldquo;Fortress America&rdquo;. John Ewart provided a company-level view of the opportunities in Emerging Markets, focusing on Asia. He emphasised the growth of domestic consumption in countries like India and China and presented several examples of world-class businesses in areas such as electric vehicles, e-commerce and fintech. Camila Guzm&aacute;n offered a strong case for Latin American Equities, describing the region as &ldquo;under-owned, undervalued, and under-touched.&rdquo; Former Chilean Finance Minister Ignacio Briones gave a detailed presentation on Chile&rsquo;s recent pension reform, which was passed earlier this year after more than a decade of political debate.</p>
<p>The seminar took place in the historic Livery Hall of the City of London&rsquo;s Guildhall, and was attended by over 130 people representing financial institutions, pension funds, wealth managers, intermediaries and consultants, who braved the London weather. Representatives from the UK and Chilean governments were also present, led by Lord Roger Liddle, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Trade Envoy for the Andean region, and Her Excellency Ximena Fuentes, Ambassador of Chile to the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Rings Bell On New Type Of Private Stock Market In Growth Boost</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>A new type of private stock market will be launched later in 2025 after the FCA announced the final rules for its Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>PISCES is a new type of platform where shares in private companies can be traded. It will open the door to more opportunities for investors, facilitating their access to growth companies. Private companies can tap into a broader range of investors and asset managers and PISCES offers exits for shareholders to sell up.</p>
<p>As companies choose to stay private for longer, there is demand for investors to trade private company shares easily and efficiently in an organised marketplace. PISCES meets this demand by allowing secondary trading of these shares. Companies can set the floor and ceiling of share prices, and have a say over who can buy their shares.</p>
<p>Access to PISCES will be limited to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, sophisticated investors and employees of participating companies. Investors will be provided with information about the risks involved to help them make informed decisions.</p>
<p>As set out in the FCA&rsquo;s letter to the PM outlining the regulator&rsquo;s approach to support growth, PISCES can unlock capital investment and liquidity.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This bold design rebalances risk, but it is bold risk-taking that made the UK the leading financial centre it is today. The new platforms will give investors greater access and confidence to invest in exciting new companies, while early backers and employees can sell up and invest again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;PISCES is the latest step in the FCA&rsquo;s wide-ranging reforms to the UK&rsquo;s markets to boost growth and competitiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emma Reynolds, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:</p>
<p>'PISCES is a great example of industry, regulators and the government working together to go further and faster on innovative reforms to strengthen UK capital markets, supporting economic growth and putting more money in people&rsquo;s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
<p>'I welcome the FCA's announcement, which follows our legislation and opens PISCES to industry. This also builds on our announcements on a stamp taxes on shares exemption for PISCES transactions, and on employees retaining the tax advantages on eligible shares traded.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the Policy Statement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-29-private-intermittent-securities-and-capital-exchange-system" title="PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox arrangements">PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox Arrangements</a>&nbsp;(June 2025).</li>
<li>The platform will be delivered through a sandbox, which will allow the FCA to test the design before finalising a permanent regime in 2030. The sandbox is now open, with shares likely to be traded later in 2025. Trading systems could include periodic auctions, as well as occasional and time-limited periods of continuous trading.</li>
<li>PISCES will be developed using a financial markets infrastructure (FMI) sandbox. This will be the second use of the FMI Sandbox powers after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-12-digital-securities-sandbox-joint-policy-statement-final-guidance" title="PS24/12: Digital Securities Sandbox joint Policy Statement and Final Guidance">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>.</li>

<li>The sandbox environment will allow government and regulators to check it is working properly. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms wishing to run a PISCES platform will have to apply to the FCA, and once approved will be able to run intermittent trading events. The FCA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/update-pisces-pre-application-support" title="Update on PISCES and pre-application support">pre-application support</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/pisces/sandbox-apply-run-platform" title="PISCES Sandbox: apply to run a platform">application support</a>&nbsp;for firms interested in applying to be a PISCES operator.</li>
<li>The regulator and government will use any lessons from the sandbox period to improve the regime before making it permanent.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai today welcomed the listing of a USD 500 million Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Sukuk issued by Sharjah Islamic Bank (&ldquo;SIB&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Bank&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The perpetual, non-call six-year AT1 Capital Certificates were issued by SIB Tier 1 Sukuk IIND Ltd and are compliant with Basel III regulations. The issuance attracted strong interest from both regional and international investors, providing Sharjah Islamic Bank with additional capital to fuel its long-term growth plans.</p>
<p>This latest transaction brings the Bank&rsquo;s total outstanding on Nasdaq Dubai to USD 2.5 billion across five listings. It also reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s strategic role in advancing the Islamic capital markets ecosystem. To mark the occasion, HE. Ahmed Saad, DCEO of Sharjah Islamic Bank rang the market opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai in the presence of Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>
<p><b>H.E. Ahmed Saad, DCEO of Sharjah Islamic Bank, commented: </b>&ldquo;The successful listing of our USD 500 million perpetual Additional Tier 1 Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai marks a significant milestone in Sharjah Islamic Bank&rsquo;s strategic growth journey. This issuance reflects our strong fundamentals, robust investor confidence, and commitment to maintaining a solid capital base in line with Basel III requirements. We are proud to deepen our relationship with Nasdaq Dubai, a platform that continues to champion innovation and global best practices in Islamic finance. As we expand our presence in international markets, we remain committed to contributing to the sustainable development of the UAE&rsquo;s financial sector and the broader Islamic capital market ecosystem."<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM,</b> said: "This listing reflects more than capital raising &mdash;it's part of a broader shift as regional institutions like Sharjah Islamic Bank lead the deepening of local debt markets. As demand for diversified, Shariah-compliant instruments continues to grow, Nasdaq Dubai is proud to serve as a trusted platform for innovation in Islamic finance. The momentum we are seeing in Sukuk issuances signals a maturing financial ecosystem where local ambition meets global capital flows. SIB&rsquo;s continued engagement underscores the strategic role financial institutions play in building resilient, forward-looking capital markets across the UAE and beyond."</p>
<p>With this listing, the total value of Sukuk listed on Nasdaq Dubai has reached USD 95.7 billion, underlining its status as one of the world&rsquo;s largest venues for Islamic fixed-income securities.</p>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s broader debt capital market has now surpassed USD 136 billion across 160 listings, reflecting growing international confidence in Dubai as a gateway for capital flows between the Middle East and the world.</p>

<title>ASIC Clears Path For Faster IPOs</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos-2025610/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos-2025610/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Entities listing on the ASX via the fast-track process now have access to a shorter initial public offering (IPO) timetable designed to reduce deal execution risk as part of a two-year trial announced by ASIC today.</p>
<p>ASIC will now informally review eligible offer documents two weeks prior to public lodgement, which could reduce the IPO timetable by up to a week.</p>
<p>The changes mean ASIC will engage with an issuer prior to the exposure period, which decreases the need for supplementary and replacement documents and extensions to the exposure period. This also reduces the risk that market volatility and consequential pricing changes may impact investor interest in the IPO.</p>
<p>The changes also include a &lsquo;no action&rsquo; position by ASIC that now allows eligible companies to accept retail investor applications during the public exposure period for new listings, cutting down the administrative timeline of the IPO process.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the initiatives had been developed in response to the decline in Australian IPOs and public companies, highlighted in ASIC&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/dp-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-a-discussion-paper-on-the-dynamics-between-public-and-private-markets/" title="DP Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets">discussion paper on the evolving dynamics between public and private markets</a>, and form part of the agency&rsquo;s regulatory simplification focus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Creating a more streamlined IPO process underscores our commitment to ensuring our public markets remain attractive to companies and investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Greater deal certainty for companies should help deliver more IPOs, which means more investment opportunities so companies can expand, increase jobs and ultimately economic growth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our initial public offerings are the lowest they have been in over a decade, and companies are de-listing. Meanwhile, our secondary capital raising settings continue to be globally recognised for their speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earlier this year, we outlined our concerns for the future of public markets and called for actionable ideas to ensure our markets remain open, efficient and attractive to investors. I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to work with industry participants and mobilise our teams to respond to actionable ideas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we do not see regulatory settings as the silver bullet, we have received lots of ideas and are considering further regulatory adjustments to support a strong and well-functioning market,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>The changes still allow for concerns to be raised during the public exposure period and the issue of shares and quotation will still only occur once the exposure period has ended.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s new approach comes into effect today, and is the first in a series of regulatory changes it is considering to enhance and improve the attractiveness of Australia&rsquo;s public markets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On 26 February 2025, ASIC released a discussion paper which explored the changing dynamics in capital markets in Australia and abroad, including declining listings on public markets, the rapid growth in investment capital allocated to private markets and the growing significance of superannuation funds in markets.</p>
<h2>Trial process</h2>
<p>The trial process is available to entities seeking the ASX fast-track listing (Eligible Entities / Eligible Companies) as part of a two-year trial starting today. ASX Fast-track is available to entities that will have a market capitalisation greater than $100 million upon listing and no ASX imposed escrow.</p>
<p>Eligible Entities can provide a pathfinder prospectus or pathfinder PDS to ASIC on a confidential basis, at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement for review. A pathfinder prospectus or PDS is a draft document distributed to professional or sophisticated investors which does not seek subscriptions from retail investors and is designed to facilitate the pricing of securities.</p>
<p>ASIC will endeavour to complete its review of the Pathfinder in the 14-day period prior to formal lodgement. ASIC will then generally not need to extend the 7-day exposure period to 14 days after lodgement other than where material new information comes to light or is included in the lodged prospectus / PDS. ASIC will retain its ability to use stop orders up until listing.</p>
<h2>Conditions of trial</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entity must be eligible for the ASX Fast Track application process.</li>
<li>Entities must email the Pathfinder to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:prelodgement@asic.gov.au">prelodgement@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement.</li>
<li>The Pathfinder must not differ in any material respect from the lodged prospectus / PDS other than for final pricing, offer amount and related metrics / financial information and as otherwise agreed with ASIC.</li>
<li>Normal ASIC review processes may apply in situations where there is an extended delay between the informal review completing and formal lodgement.</li>
<li>A Pathfinder review by ASIC does not endorse the contents of the Pathfinder or preclude ASIC or a third party from taking action in respect of the lodged prospectus / PDS or the offer it contains.</li>
<li>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the trial at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ASIC no-action position</h2>
<p>ASIC is also announcing a class no-action position where an Eligible Company accepts an application during the exposure period. This aligns the process for prospectuses with PDSs, simplifying the process by removing the need to wait for the exposure period to lapse.</p>
<p>ASIC does not intend to take action for a contravention of subsections 727(3) or (6) of the Corporations Act where a person accepts an application for non-quoted securities offered under a disclosure document during the period referred to in subsection 727(3) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s no-action position applies only to the offers of non-quoted securities under a disclosure document issued by an Eligible Company in accordance with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act made during the trial period.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s general policy on &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; positions also applies. Their status is set out in Regulatory Guide 108&nbsp;<em>No-action letters</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-108-no-action-letters/" title="RG 108 No-action letters">RG 108</a>). In particular, it should be noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>a no-action letter is an expression of regulatory intention about how to exercise ASIC&rsquo;s powers. The purpose of a no-action letter is to provide an indication as to the future regulatory action that we might take. Entities do not need to apply to ASIC to avail themselves of this no-action position.</li>
<li>an ASIC no-action letter does not necessarily preclude third parties (including the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions) from taking legal action in relation to the same conduct or conduct of that kind. Nor does it prevent a court from holding that particular conduct infringes the relevant legislation. ASIC does not represent that the conduct covered by the no-action letter will not be held to contravene the relevant legislation. Nor does ASIC undertake to intervene in an action brought by third parties in respect of such conduct.</li>
<li>a no-action letter is not a guarantee that ASIC will not take action in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position during the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position at any time.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the panelists and attendees today for the Commission&rsquo;s fifth roundtable organized by the Crypto Task Force, entitled &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Reflecting on the &ldquo;American Spirit&rdquo; brings to mind the expedition of Merriweather Lewis and William Clark. About 220 years ago on May 14, 1804, Lewis and Clark set out to explore the new Louisiana Territory, purchased the prior year by President Thomas Jefferson.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The size of the United States had doubled overnight, but there were no reliable maps or established routes through the new land. Despite this daunting challenge, Lewis and Clark entered the wilderness to carry out their mission.</p>
<p>While perhaps not nearly as fraught with personal danger, the Commission is similarly navigating through challenging new terrain and plunging into the regulatory wilderness under the leadership of Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force. While the Commission&rsquo;s tools &ndash; such as roundtables, public consultation, and economic analysis &ndash; may be different, I am confident that our expedition can succeed in updating our rulebook to open up new opportunities for American investors and businesses.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s treatment of decentralized finance and other emerging technologies over the past four years was not conducive to regulatory transparency and discouraged entrepreneurs and those developing DeFi from engaging with the Commission. However, that approach has recently changed under the Crypto Task Force, which is charged with coordinating the Commission&rsquo;s effort to find answers to many pressing questions. Thus far, they have changed the SEC&rsquo;s posture on crypto, embraced difficult regulatory questions, and promoted transparency by engaging with the market participants driving innovation and change.</p>
<p>This SEC is committed to high quality regulation. High quality regulation takes time and administrative processes matter. For those who are involved in the development of DeFi, please be patient and work with the Commission and its staff towards achieving the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Although I am uncertain as to what &ldquo;perfect regulation&rdquo; may look like, the path towards it begins with seeking input from the public. This journey towards regulatory clarity will likely be frustrating, and may move in fits and starts. However, by learning from DeFi innovators and advocates, the Commission has a better chance at regulating securities transactions involving DeFi and protecting American investors who utilize decentralized financial services and products.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s participants will provide knowledge and insight about DeFi&rsquo;s development and the existing regulatory barriers preventing growth. Such contributions will help the Commission attempt to strike the proper balance between its role as a regulator and its mandate to foster competition, efficiency, and capital formation.</p>
<p>In DeFi, there is a new landscape of opportunities. People can transact directly with each other without relying on banks or other centralized intermediaries. The Commission should not refrain from engaging in oversight of novel areas simply because it involves thinking outside the existing framework.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The legacy regulatory regime under the federal securities laws presupposes the existence and necessity of numerous intermediaries. I look forward to hearing from today&rsquo;s panelists as to whether such presumptions remain necessary.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>In which types of situations do DeFi systems and smart contracts potentially eliminate the need for a financial intermediary and how?</li>
<li>In what situations should DeFi systems be deemed to fall outside the scope of the securities laws?</li>
<li>What key safeguards are necessary when the securities laws apply to these arrangements?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s journey took time to complete and carved out an important path to facilitate westward expansion. In so doing, they provided a valuable contribution to American progress. Today&rsquo;s roundtable reflects the SEC&rsquo;s commitment to continued progress and its willingness to consider the role of emerging technologies. As the Commission continues to move through the regulatory wilderness, it should remain true to its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation in its efforts to respond to market innovation.</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to the conversation.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Final Crypto Task Force Roundtable: Where We Go From Here, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. As we begin the final event of this Crypto Task Force series, I think this is a good opportunity to reflect on what has come out of these roundtables and where the Task Force, and the Commission, are going from here.</p>
<p>These roundtables have highlighted that &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; is far from a monolith. We have heard a markedly diverse set of viewpoints, from many different segments of the industry.</p>
<p>We have heard, for example, from many non-SEC registered entities with varying views on whether they or their products should be required to register and be subject to SEC jurisdiction. I expect that this will be a key theme of today&rsquo;s DeFi panel. Back in November 2021, I wrote an article<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;detailing my views on the opportunities and challenges of DeFi, which I believe require industry and regulatory collaboration to develop compliant solutions. The issues I raised in that article related to market structure, transparency, and retail investor protection, among others, still remain questions today, so I look forward to hearing the panelists&rsquo; views on how we should approach these challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond issues related to registration and jurisdictional lines, other roundtables have focused on current SEC registrants who want to continue operating under SEC oversight, but with altered regulatory requirements tailored to new types of products and technologies.</p>
<p>In addition to these varied and sometimes competing regulatory views, we have heard different opinions on the technologies underlying digital asset products and services. We have heard panelists highlight advantages or disadvantages of particular technologies, and give differing predictions on their capabilities to function effectively as part of a large, complex securities market.</p>
<p>In sum, these roundtables have given us a lot to grapple with, to say the least. While the series was billed as a &ldquo;spring sprint towards crypto clarity,&rdquo; I am unsure whether we&rsquo;ve identified much that can be simply or quickly clarified. When it comes to crypto, it does not appear to me that the SEC is facing problems with ready or easy solutions. What we are facing is heightened expectations of rolling out major changes &mdash;quickly&mdash; to pave the way for crypto expansion into the capital markets.</p>
<p>With issues this complex and stakes this high, it&rsquo;s better to do it right than fast. We need to grapple with the tough questions through the legally sanctioned process of formal rulemaking, as Chairman Atkins alluded to earlier, with full opportunity for notice and comment and public interest findings. I look forward to engaging with my fellow Commissioners, the staff, and the public on what I hope will be a thoughtful and mission-driven rulemaking process for this space. Thank you.</p>

<title>DeFining The American Spirit, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins, Commissioner Crenshaw, and Commissioner Uyeda, and thank you all for joining us in-person or online for the final afternoon of the Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s Spring Sprint roundtable series: &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you especially to our moderator, Troy Paredes, who is returning after his excellent performance at our first roundtable back in March. Troy, we are grateful to have you here again as we wrap up. I also appreciate today&rsquo;s panelists for being part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Over the past four months, the Task Force has held roundtables on security status, trading, tokenization, and custody.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These roundtables have provided invaluable input to the Commission, the Task Force, and the rest of the Commission staff&mdash;input that has informed our views and improved our efforts. The Task Force, which hit the ground running in a sprint of roundtables, intends to keep running the clarity marathon, and the perspectives of roundtable participants will help determine the course.</p>
<p>Our final roundtable is on DeFi, or decentralized finance. You may ask: What business does the SEC have in talking about regulating DeFi? Absolutely none is a reasonable answer, so with that, we will wrap up this roundtable: Thank you everyone for attending! OK, not so fast. Life is not that simple. Even getting to&nbsp;<i>no</i>&nbsp;regulation requires some talking.</p>
<p>What is DeFi? Bitcoin is &ldquo;decentralized finance,&rdquo; but it may not be what first comes to mind when we think of DeFi. Google says DeFi is &ldquo;a blockchain-based financial system that aims to replace traditional financial institutions with peer-to-peer transactions and smart contracts.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;DeFi brings to mind decentralized networks, which enable people to trade tokens and derivatives, engage in lending, or participate in prediction markets. Although sometimes referred to as DeFi &ldquo;platforms,&rdquo; DeFi is not a&nbsp;<i>place</i>&nbsp;people go to access services that someone else provides and controls; it is software code that people use to engage in the activity of transacting without a centralized intermediary. To channel one of today&rsquo;s panelists, I do not go to a decentralized exchange; I make a decentralized exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>DeFi defies our traditional, permissioned world of intermediaries. It enables a person to engage with her peers through a protocol that is open to everybody on the same transparent terms: no need to get consent from any centralized gatekeeper. At its core, DeFi, which blockchain technology enables, is about the freedom to transact with your peers without permission, interference, or intermediation. And that is why DeFi resonates so deeply with the American spirit.</p>
<p>Also resonant with the American spirit is the ability of people to publish written material without permission. Code is protected speech. Because the First Amendment protects someone who writes a DeFi software protocol and publishes it, the SEC has no authority to demand pre-publication approval rights even for code that could be used to exchange securities. The SEC must not infringe on First Amendment rights by regulating someone who merely publishes code on the basis that others use that code to carry out activity that the SEC has traditionally regulated. If somebody else subsequently violates the law using the software protocol, the user&mdash;not the developer of the software&mdash;should face the music.</p>
<p>But sometimes the writer of a protocol used to exchange securities does more than merely publish it. She also might operate, administer, or maintain a platform through which the code can be accessed and that takes custody of client assets or makes execution decisions for clients. In this and other instances, the coder or her platform might be subject to regulation for that conduct. If that conduct relates to securities, the SEC might have a role to play.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Centralized entities that use DeFi protocols that someone else wrote to serve clients do not get a regulatory pass either. Nor can centralized entities avoid regulation by hiding behind a &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; label; that is DINO, or DeFi-In-Name-Only.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;With centralized entities comes the potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, principal-agent problems, information asymmetries, and other issues common in the traditional finance world&mdash;all the issues DeFi is designed to address. The SEC&rsquo;s efforts are best spent protecting investors, not from their own use of open-source software code to engage in transactions with their peers, nor from writers of such code, but from providers of financial services.</p>
<p>I hope that today&rsquo;s discussion will help us ensure that SEC regulation is able to reach activities and entities properly within its ambit regardless of what label they bear, without prohibiting the exercise of individuals&rsquo; rights to publish code and interact with that code. I now will hand it off to Troy. Thank you all for being here, and I look forward to the discussion.</p>

Although the details in the settlement order are limited, the facts at issue there could help spur discussion of which types of activities the SEC should reach. Coburn was the only person with the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract, as he was the only person with access to the private key for the administrator account, which could be used to change the permissible fees for transacting using EtherDelta or the address of the account to which those fees were directed. The order book sat on a centralized server that was maintained by EtherDelta, rather than on the Ethereum Blockchain. https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2018/34-84553.pdf</p>

<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood today released a letter in response to correspondence from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors requesting the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) rescind its preemption regulations.</p>
<p>In the letter, Acting Comptroller Hood reaffirmed the OCC&rsquo;s support and defense of preemption as a cornerstone of the dual banking system that is fundamental to the operation of the federal banking system. The OCC&rsquo;s preemption regulations are consistent with federal law, Supreme Court precedent, and a powerful enabler of local and national prosperity and growth.</p>

<p>The Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, MFA and SIFMA called for significant reforms to how federal financial regulators handle sensitive data following the latest in a series of data breaches that exposed over 148,000 private correspondences containing sensitive supervisory information about U.S. financial institutions. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/data-security-joint-trades/">letter</a>&nbsp;addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the organizations identified concerns with regulators&rsquo; data management practices spanning the previous administration. Weaknesses were identified in February 2025; however, growing threats from hostile nation-states targeting U.S. critical infrastructure serve as a reminder of the urgency to address vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[G]overnment agencies are increasingly the target of persistent and sophisticated nation-state attacks that could disrupt financial markets and our economy,&rdquo; the organizations wrote. &ldquo;It is imperative that federal regulators recognize that they are equally a target of malicious actors and implement the same or substantially similar cybersecurity and incident response practices that they expect financial institutions to maintain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Financial institutions are legally required to share sensitive, proprietary and non-public information with their regulators as part of the supervisory process. This information can range from capital and liquidity management to cybersecurity protocols. However, centralizing large amounts of data can create a prime target for illicit actors seeking to harm U.S. economic security. Government agencies, including regulatory agencies, are increasingly the target of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, both the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency &mdash; the Treasury bureau responsible for supervising the U.S. banking system &mdash; have suffered significant cyber incidents. The latest dates back to 2023 and was identified in early 2025. Here are the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackers compromised the OCC&rsquo;s systems in May 2023.</li>
<li>The OCC did not learn of the suspicious activity until February 2025 &mdash; meaning, hackers likely had access to the OCC&rsquo;s systems for over a year and a half.</li>
<li>The breach exposed an estimated 148,000 emails, some of which may have contained highly sensitive supervisory information that could give hostile nation states ample information to harm America&rsquo;s financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These weaknesses point to a pattern of problems in how U.S. agencies secure data and are held accountable. To mitigate risk and prevent similar problems in the future, the groups made four recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold agencies to the same security and data protection standards as private companies.</li>
<li>Avoid centralizing sensitive data that could affect entire economic sectors and instead allow companies to maintain control and access to their data.</li>
<li>Require regulatory agencies to notify affected companies when things go wrong.</li>
<li>Limit data collection to only what is necessary.</li>
</ol>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you and good afternoon.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is a great pleasure to be with you today. Let me begin by thanking Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force for their organizing today&rsquo;s event, and Commissioner Crenshaw and Commissioner Uyeda for their participation.&nbsp; Of course, I very much thank the roundtable panelists and our moderator, Troy Parades, for their voluntary contribution of time and talent to our endeavor.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s roundtable is titled &ldquo;DeFi and&nbsp;<i>the American Spirit</i>.&rdquo; This is an apt title because the American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, movement.</p>
<p>Blockchains, of course, are a very creative and potentially revolutionary innovation that have us rethinking evidence of ownership and transfer of intellectual and economic property rights.&nbsp; They are shared databases that enable ownership of a type of digital property called crypto assets without reliance on an intermediary or central party. Instead, these peer-to-peer networks incorporate an economic mechanism to encourage participants to validate and maintain the database in accordance with the network&rsquo;s rules. These are free market systems where users pay demand-based fees to network participants to have their transactions included within a so-called &ldquo;block&rdquo; of data with finite storage capacity.</p>
<p>The prior U.S. government administration discouraged Americans from participating in these market-based systems by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions. I am grateful to the Division of Corporation Finance staff for clarifying its view that voluntary participation in a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake network as a &ldquo;miner,&rdquo; &ldquo;validator,&rdquo; or &ldquo;staking-as-a-service&rdquo; provider is not within the scope of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; As happy as I am over that step, it is not a duly promulgated rule with the force of law, so we cannot stop there.&nbsp; The Securities and Exchange Commission must adopt a regulation based on the authority that Congress has given us.</p>
<p>Another core feature of blockchain technology is the ability for individuals to have self-custody of crypto assets in a personal digital wallet. The right to have self-custody of one&rsquo;s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet. I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially where intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.</p>
<p>The prior President&rsquo;s administration undermined innovation in self-custodial digital wallets and other on-chain technologies by asserting through regulatory actions that the developers of such software may be conducting brokerage activity. Engineers should not be subject to the federal securities laws solely for publishing this type of software code. As one court put it, it would be irrational to hold the developer of a self-driving car liable &ndash; here, quoting from the court&rsquo;s decision &ndash; &ldquo;for a third-party&rsquo;s use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank. In those circumstances, one would not sue the car company for facilitating the wrongdoing; they would sue the individual who committed the wrong.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are developing software applications that are designed to function without administration by any operator. The idea of self-executing software code that is accessible to everyone, but controlled by no one, and that enables private, peer-to-peer transactions may sound like science fiction. But, blockchain technology makes possible an entirely new class of software that can perform these functions without an intermediary. I do not believe that we should allow century-old regulatory frameworks to stifle innovation with technologies that could upend and most importantly improve and advance our current, traditional intermediated model.&nbsp; We should not automatically fear the future.</p>
<p>These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises. While centralized platforms waivered and failed under recent stresses, many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Most current securities rules and regulations are premised upon the regulation of issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries. I have asked the Commission staff to explore whether further guidance or rulemaking may be helpful for enabling registrants to transact with these software systems in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>I also am excited about the use of on-chain software systems by issuers and intermediaries to eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity. Current securities regulations already contemplate the use of new technologies by issuers and intermediaries, but I have asked the staff to consider whether amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules and regulations would be better suited to provide needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries who seek to administer on-chain financial systems.</p>
<p>While the Commission and its staff work to propose fit-for-purpose rules of the road for on-chain financial markets, I have directed the staff to consider a conditional exemptive relief framework or &ldquo;innovation exemption&rdquo; that would expeditiously allow registrants and non-registrants to bring on-chain products and services to market. An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump&rsquo;s vision to make America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the planet&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with to certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the discussions to follow.</p>
