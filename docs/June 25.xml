<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Today ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse confirmed that Group Executive Listings Blair Beaton has decided to depart the business following an extended period of personal leave.</p>
<p>Ms Lofthouse said: &ldquo;Blair was a highly valued member of the ASX leadership team, and we are deeply grateful for his contribution to ASX over the past eight years. His dedication, diligence and enthusiasm were consistently evident in all his engagements, and in more recent times he has been a vocal and passionate advocate for ASX as the nation&rsquo;s premier listings venue. He leaves with our heartfelt best wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Beaton joined ASX in 2017 as Chief Strategy Officer and was appointed Group Executive, Listings in August 2022. In leading Listings Mr Beaton was responsible for the origination of listed primary and secondary equity and investment products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the time Mr Beaton was on leave, Group Executive Markets Darren Yip had been providing support and oversight of the Listings business. With Mr Beaton now having decided to step down, ASX will bring Listings together with Markets under Mr Yip&rsquo;s leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is effective immediately and we will be working through how best to ensure both businesses are working effectively together.</p>

<title>Malaysia’s Sustainability Reporting Aligns With Global ISSB Standards In IFRS Jurisdictional Profile</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation has recognised Malaysia&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability reporting in its recently issued Jurisdictional Profile. Malaysia is acknowledged as adopting the ISSB Standards with limited transition, representing the only jurisdiction in the ASEAN region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recognition in the Jurisdictional Profile underscores the global standing of Malaysia&rsquo;s National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launched in September 2024 and developed by the Advisory Committee on Sustainability Reporting (ACSR), the NSRF is a significant step in advancing Malaysia&rsquo;s corporate sustainability agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NSRF phases in the adoption of ISSB Standards, specifically IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. Starting with a &rsquo;limited transition&rsquo; approach, Malaysia extends certain transitional standard reliefs, including &lsquo;climate-first&rsquo; reporting and deferred Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach facilitates a smooth transition to full adoption of the ISSB Standards, while recognising the varying levels and maturity in sustainability practices and reporting across companies.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said that the ACSR welcomes the ISSB&rsquo;s endorsement, which represents an important recognition of our efforts in using the ISSB Standards as the baseline for sustainability disclosures in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ACSR is cognisant of the high standards the ISSB Standards has set for sustainability reporting, and the challenges this may pose to entities. We remain committed to equipping reporting entities to meet these requirements,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>To ensure the readiness of applicable entities, the NSRF introduced the PACE (Policy, Assumptions, Calculators, Education) initiative, providing training, tools and resources. This includes training on interoperability between the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and ISSB Standards conducted in March this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Other upcoming PACE initiatives include the development of Illustrative Sustainability Reports to guide company disclosures and an NSRF Preparers&rsquo; Programme to strengthen capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ACSR will also continue engaging with the industry to understand sector-specific challenges in adopting the ISSB Standards.</p>
<p>The first cohort of Jurisdictional Profiles was published by the IFRS Foundation on 12 June 2025. The publication provides transparency to capital markets on the adoption approaches of different jurisdictions.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority  Consults On Class Exemption For Buy-Backs Of Quoted Debt Securities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-consults-on-class-exemption-for-buy-bac-2025613/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is seeking feedback on a proposed class exemption for listed issuers from certain unsolicited offer regulations for buy-backs of their own quoted debt securities.</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director, Evaluation and Oversight Liam Mason said: &ldquo;One of our key priorities is to support innovation and growth by removing unnecessary regulatory burden. &nbsp;This consultation responds to feedback from the market that this is an area where changes could be made to make it easier for firms while still ensuring appropriate investor protection.</p>
<p>The purpose of the unsolicited offer regulations in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act) is to provide a comprehensive and robust framework to protect against &lsquo;low-ball&rsquo; unsolicited offers, as well as to allow the FMA, as the regulator, to take both a proactive and reactive approach to monitoring and enforcement.</p>
<p>However, where an issuer is seeking to buy back its own quoted debt securities, the regulations&rsquo; prescriptive disclosure and timing requirements may limit the flexibility of issuers to manage their debt efficiently.</p>
<p>If granted, the exemption would allow listed issuers to buy back their own quoted debt securities off-market, without needing to prepare certain information in a disclosure document or adhere to certain timing requirements. The exemption would be subject to conditions that the issuer must make available information about the offer to buy back the debt securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Issuers are already subject to ongoing disclosure and governance obligations under the FMC Act, as well as the listing rules of the relevant licensed market, and already have a relationship with their debt security holders. Therefore, the risks may be substantially lower compared to other unsolicited, potentially low-ball, offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>The consultation is open until 25 July 2025</span></p>
<p><span class="button-link--white"><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/business/focus-areas/consultation/consultation-proposed-class-exemption-for-listed-issuers-for-buy-backs-of-quoted-debt-securities/" title="Link to consultation page">View Consultation: Proposed class exemption for listed issuers for buy-backs of quoted debt securities</a></span></p>

<title>Press Conference By KATO Katsunobu, Japan Minister Of Finance And Minister Of State For Financial Services - Iwaki Shinkumi Bank</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, June 3,&nbsp;2025, 8:38&nbsp;am to 8:47&nbsp;am)</p>
<dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>I have a question about Iwaki Shinkumi Bank (credit cooperative). Regarding the fraudulent financing issue, the report published by the third-party committee on May 30 pointed out that there were cases in which important facts were concealed and false explanations were given during the investigation. It is also mentioned that there were attempts to conceal details in reporting to the Local Finance Bureau based on the judgment of the bank&rsquo;s headquarters. How do you perceive the bank&rsquo;s stance?</p>
<p>Also, what are your thoughts on ensuring the effectiveness of measures to demand improvements in such financial institutions?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>First, I understand that the third-party committee&rsquo;s investigation report released on the 30th of last week severely criticized the bank&rsquo;s uncooperative attitude during the investigation, including the destruction of important documents, and that such points were explained at the time of the announcement.&nbsp;While the report does mention that the investigation was voluntary and was unable to obtain sufficient cooperation, we find it deeply regrettable that Iwaki Shinkumi Bank still has no apparent attitude to clarify the truth, and we strongly urge the bank to reflect deeply on this matter.</p>
<p>Additionally, although separate from the third-party committee&rsquo;s investigation, there were reports that contradicted the facts, such as claiming that an internal investigation had been conducted despite it did not conduct, in response to the request for a report issued by the Local Financial Bureau in November last year. Although corrections were made to the report subsequently, it is extremely regrettable that accurate reports were not made from the outset. We promptly issued a request for reporting in February of this year, demanding clarification of the circumstances that led to the submission of a report that differed from the facts.</p>
<p>The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has begun on-site inspection to clarify the full details of this case and will continue to thoroughly confirm and verify the facts.<br />Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of the business improvement order, we believe it is necessary to improve the organizational culture of the bank, which has been identified as the underlying cause of the series of irregularities and the uncooperative response to the investigation by the third-party committee.</p>
<p>In the business improvement order issued on the 29th of last week, we have also requested a fundamental review of the bank&rsquo;s management structure and organizational culture, including the clarification of management responsibility and the pursuit of responsibilities from both civil and criminal perspectives.</p>
<p>We are aware that the bank has already announced that seven members, including the chairman, have resigned, and that it will renew its management structure by appointing executives from the Shinkumi Federation Bank and hiring external personnel with expertise in internal management.</p>
<p>The FSA will continue to conduct on-site inspections and other measures to confirm facts. At the same time, while taking into account the bank&rsquo;s issues pointed out by the third-party committee, the FSA will steadily pursue responsibilities from both civil and criminal perspectives. Additionally, the FSA will strongly instruct the bank in fundamentally reviewing its management structure and improving its operations, and will rigorously confirm and verify the progress of such efforts.</p>

<title>CFTC Announces Additional Cost Savings From Office Leases - Plan Saves Millions Over Short And Long Term</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-announces-additional-cost-savings-from-office-leases-plan-saves-millions-2025613/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-announces-additional-cost-savings-from-office-leases-plan-saves-millions-2025613/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the process of extending a lease at its current headquarters while buildout continues on its new offices. The one-year extension represents a 4.5 percent reduction in rental expenses, totaling nearly $1 million. This logical and fiscally responsible arrangement allows for staff to continue their work uninterrupted while the new facility is completed, in full compliance with the President&rsquo;s executive orders, and avoids the excess costs, inefficiencies and inconveniences of moving multiple times. The CFTC has already saved nearly $340,000 by renegotiating its lease at its Chicago branch office.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s new headquarters in an existing building in Southwest Washington is scheduled to come online in June 2026. The lease at the current headquarters in Northwest Washington expires on September 30, requiring a short-term solution. The CFTC was able to negotiate the one-year extension at the current facility at a meaningfully reduced rate. The lease at the new facility will be significantly reduced from the FY 2025 rate of over $21.37 million to just over $6 million.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are additional details about the extension:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The extension will not require additional funding from Congress</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s current rent expense is built into the existing budget.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Rental and payment line items in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/cj"><span>FY 2026 budget request</span></a><span>&nbsp;are unchanged from FY 2025 enacted levels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The extension is expected to result in savings of 4.5 percent compared with the lease expense in FY 2025.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>The CFTC considered various scenarios and determined that an extension was the most logical, efficient and responsible option.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC partnered with GSA in the search and acquisition process for the new HQ, including regarding contingencies in the event of delays in bringing the new HQ online. &nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While the CFTC has worked with GSA throughout the process, the CFTC negotiated directly with the lessor to extend the lease at the current HQ, as required by statute. This is consistent with decades of historical precedent and practice regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s independent leasing authority and the terms of an MOU with GSA, which covers leases at new facilities, not existing leases.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While the CFTC and GSA had planned to use temporary space from another federal agency that was in GSA&rsquo;s inventory after the expiration of the CFTC&rsquo;s HQ lease in September 2025, the agreement for the CFTC&rsquo;s temporary space was canceled by the other federal agency due to their mission needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Moving to a temporary space would have also cost millions to move staff and equipment to and from the temporary space as well as the setting up and decommissioning of that space.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Teleworking during this time is not a viable option&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC is committed to complying with President Trump&rsquo;s return-to-office executive orders, just like other Americans who go to work every day without special treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A teleworking posture would still require the CFTC to secure a physical space for its IT infrastructure and other critical services, which would require a lease and two moves, costing millions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC inspector general identified widespread and prolonged&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12051/oig_SROI_042425/download"><span>telework fraud</span></a><span>&nbsp;during the CFTC&rsquo;s post-COVID fully remote telework period of over four years. This has prompted an ongoing review of CFTC employee compliance with federal government laws and regulations regarding time and attendance to better safeguard American taxpayer dollars from waste and fraud by federal employees who have been collecting pay for time not actually worked. This ongoing review has identified additional instances of telework fraud and misuse of government property and paid official time. CFTC employees are the highest paid in the entire federal government, making nearly $250,000 per year on average.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Adopts New Framework For Distributing Disgorged Funds Collected To Harmed Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-502/osc-notice-publication-osc-rule-11-502-distribution-amounts-received-osc-under-disgorgement-orders">final rules</a>&nbsp;to implement a new statutory framework that will facilitate distributing amounts collected by the OSC under disgorgement orders to harmed investors. Disgorgement is a type of monetary sanction imposed by the Capital Markets Tribunal or the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Disgorgement sanctions require the respondent in a proceeding to pay any amounts obtained because of their non-compliance with securities law or commodity futures law.</p>
<p>Once the rules come into force, under the new process, the OSC will highlight each disgorgement order on a new section of the OSC website and provide investors with the ability to register their contact information if they would like to be contacted about a potential future distribution of disgorged amounts collected under the order. This new section of the website will also allow investors to stay informed about any amounts collected under the order, and whether the OSC has started a distribution. It will also outline how investors can submit claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new distribution framework provides investors who are harmed by misconduct that results in a disgorgement order with a streamlined and transparent framework to recover parts of their losses from amounts collected by the OSC,&rdquo; said Naizam Kanji, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Legal and Governance, Ontario Securities Commission. &ldquo;While the OSC will also continue using no contest settlements and receiverships to return money to harmed investors in appropriate cases, this new process is an important addition to the OSC&rsquo;s investor redress toolkit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pending the coming into effect of legislative amendments to the Ontario&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>,&nbsp;<em>Commodity Futures Act</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Securities Commission Act, 2021,</em>&nbsp;the new rules are expected to come into force in late summer or early fall 2025. The new rules follow careful consultation with stakeholders and support the implementation of the modernized distribution framework prescribed by the 2023 legislative amendments to the Ontario&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>,&nbsp;<em>Commodity Futures Act</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Securities Commission Act, 2021</em>. The introduction of this new statutory distribution framework aligns the OSC with other Canadian and international regulators with similar distribution frameworks.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>BC Securities Commission Launches Scamtones To Help Seniors Avoid Investment Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-launches-scamtones-to-help-seniors-avoid-investment-fra-2025612/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The BC Securities Commission (BCSC) is turning up the volume on fraud prevention with a new ad campaign that uses custom ringtones to help seniors and their families recognize and avoid investment scams.</span></p>
<p>Investment fraud is one of the most common and most devastating crimes affecting seniors in British Columbia, and it&rsquo;s evolving fast. Scammers use artificial intelligence and exploit digital illiteracy to target older adults, preying on their trust and financial hopes.</p>
<p>To help seniors and their families recognize the warning signs before it&rsquo;s too late, the BCSC is distributing&nbsp;<em>Scamtones</em>, a collection of five custom ringtones that turn every unknown call into a reminder about fraudulent schemes.&nbsp;<em>Scamtones</em>&nbsp;deliver anti-fraud messages in a variety of musical styles &ndash; classic rock, country, Motown and jazz &ndash; while highlighting a key red flag of investment fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scammers may be calling your grandparents more than you are,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Education. &ldquo;<em>Scamtones</em>&nbsp;is meant to spark conversations between seniors and their &nbsp;more tech-savvy relatives about investment fraud in the digital era. These ringtones are a reminder for older adults to pause and think twice about picking up or responding to a suspicious call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ringtones are available on&nbsp;<a>Scamtones.ca</a>, a new microsite where British Columbians can listen to and download the ringtones, as well as find vital resources on investment fraud and elder financial abuse.</p>
<p>The campaign launches ahead of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEADD) on June 15, and aims to shine a spotlight on a growing crisis.</p>
<p>In 2024 alone, global fraud losses linked to elderly victims reached an estimated $77.7 billion, according to the Nasdaq Global Financial Crime Report. In Canada, reported fraud losses topped $638 million, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, with seniors among the most targeted. Seniors make up approximately 19 per cent of the Canadian population and are among the fastest-growing demographics in Canada, according to Statistics Canada. Investment scams are one of the most common types of fraud targeted toward seniors.</p>
<p>Older adults are vulnerable due to a variety of factors: social isolation and cognitive decline can make it harder for them to spot a scam, and fear of losing independence can make them wary of asking for help.&nbsp;Many are drawn to promises of high returns and low risk, hoping to stretch their retirement savings or leave a legacy for loved ones.</p>
<p>Resources about elder financial abuse are available on the BCSC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/avoid-fraud/identify-frauds-and-scams/elder-financial-abuse/" target="_blank">InvestRight.org website</a>, including tips on how to initiate a conversation with a loved one about financial abuse, information about why having a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/news-and-insights/investing-articles/the-value-of-choosing-a-trusted-contact-person/" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;is important, and instructions on how to report suspected investment fraud.</p>
<p><span>Additional Quotes</span></p>
<p><span>Dan Levitt, B.C. Seniors Advocate</span></p>
<p>"Financial abuse &ndash; especially investment fraud &ndash; often goes unreported, yet its consequences can strip seniors of their independence and devastate entire families. As more seniors embrace technology to stay connected, tools like Scamtones provide an engaging way to help them recognize the warning signs of fraud and protect themselves with confidence.&rdquo;<br /><span><br />Laura Tamblyn Watts, President and CEO, CanAge</span></p>
<p>"Scammers exploit the trust and goodwill of seniors, making financial fraud a growing threat. As technology advances, distinguishing a legitimate call from a scam is more challenging than ever.&nbsp;<em>Scamtones</em>&nbsp;is a great resource to help families start crucial conversations about spotting investment scammers &ndash; empowering seniors to hang up, ask the right questions, and safeguard their hard-earned savings."</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Proposes Amendments To Modernize And Streamline Mining Disclosure Standards</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-proposes-amendments-to-modernize-and-streamli-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is seeking feedback on proposed amendments to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/43-401">National Instrument 43-101<em>&nbsp;Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</em></a>.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments are intended to clarify, harmonize and streamline Canada&rsquo;s mining disclosure regime without introducing any new requirements. The proposed amendments would update and enhance the standards for disclosing scientific and technical information about mineral projects to address evolving disclosure practices and policy considerations identified by CSA staff, and to reflect changing industry and investor expectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to provide investors with clear, reliable information about mineral projects so they can make informed decisions, without imposing an undue regulatory burden on mining issuers,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;By modernizing and streamlining the disclosure regime, we aim to maintain Canada&rsquo;s position as the global standard for mining disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to National Instrument 43-101&nbsp;<em>Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</em>&nbsp;are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove or replace certain definitions and requirements that have become outdated.</li>
<li>modernize and streamline certain requirements to reflect current industry practice.</li>
<li>provide clarification and guidance on certain definitions and requirements.</li>
<li>make other minor language changes to clarify disclosure requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed amendments are published for a 120-day comment period and are available on CSA member websites.</p>
<p>In April 2022, the CSA published CSA Consultation Paper 43-401&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2022/04/6006038-CSA-Notice-43-401-consultation-paper-NI-43-101.pdf">Consultation on National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</a></em>&nbsp;to inform this project. The CSA received valuable feedback from a large number of market participants, which it has considered.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ISDA Launches Pre-Adherence Period For Notices Hub</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-launches-pre-adherence-period-for-notices-hub-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-launches-pre-adherence-period-for-notices-hub-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has begun a pre-adherence process for the ISDA Notices Hub, enabling firms to sign up to a free protocol that will allow them to use the new platform when it launches on July 15.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, time-critical termination notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods including physical delivery, using company address details listed in the agreement. The protocol will change all agreements between adhering firms to allow them to use the ISDA Notices Hub &ndash; a secure online platform managed by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of termination notices and waivers and help ensure address details for physical delivery are up to date.</p>
<p>Delays and uncertainty over the delivery of notices can lead to losses running to millions of dollars. This can occur if a counterparty has moved offices without updating the address details in their documentation. More recent issues emerged during the pandemic lockdowns, making it extremely difficult to deliver or receive notices because offices were closed.</p>
<p>The ISDA Notices Hub will act as a secure central platform for firms to deliver notices (including waivers), with automatic alerts sent to the receiving entity. Multiple designated people at each firm will be able to access the hub from anywhere in the world, regardless of the situation at its physical location. The platform will also allow market participants to update their physical address details in all their agreements via a single entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ISDA Notices Hub will radically improve the operational efficiency of delivering and receiving time-critical termination notices under ISDA Master Agreements, helping to reduce the risk of losses that can occur from delays. Notices are delivered instantly and are time and date stamped, giving users the certainty they need to move forward with closing out and valuing trades,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>Adherence to the protocol is free for all market participants. Use of the ISDA Notices Hub will be free for buy-side firms, while dealers can benefit from two years of discounted fees if they adopt early.</p>
<p>Firms can sign up to the pre-adherence&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2025-notices-hub-protocol/?special-access=NHP">here</a>.</p>
<p>A letter from ISDA CEO Scott O&rsquo;Malia to market participants requesting their adoption of the ISDA Notices Hub is available&nbsp;<a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/K-ZMCoAgDjfjwW9kI6srhpv1c5?domain=urldefense.com">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today a revised list of validation rules in its Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting, highlighting those which have been deactivated either for incorrectness or for triggering IT problems. Competent Authorities throughout the EU are informed that data submitted in accordance with these ITS should not be formally validated against the set of deactivated rules. The EBA also released today a small validation package including a micro taxonomy package and DPM VR deactivation updates scripts, which are needed from release 4.0, for each deactivation exercises, to deactivate rules in taxonomy and in DPM in a consistent manner.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published final reports on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA32-117195963-1417_Final_Report_Listing_Act_Advice_on_Prospectus.pdf">Prospectus Regulation</a>&nbsp;and on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA32-117195963-1413_Final_Report_Technical_Advice_on_Civil_Prospectus_Liability.pdf">civil prospectus liability</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>These reports provide&nbsp;recommendations meant to facilitate capital market activity by reducing regulatory burden and also include the results of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA32-117195963-1257_Call_for_evidence_prospectus_liability.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s Call for Evidence on civil prospectus liability</a><span>&nbsp;(CfE).&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span><span>Key proposals and findings</span></span></h4>
<p><span>The technical advice on the Prospectus Regulation contains:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>advice relating to the content and format of prospectuses;</span></li>
<li><span>proposed disclosure annexes for non-equity securities that are advertised with ESG features;</span></li>
<li><span>advice relating to the scrutiny of information in prospectuses as well as advice relating to the procedures for the approval of a prospectus; and</span></li>
<li><span>proposals to updates to the data reporting requirements in line with changes introduced by the Listing Act and in relation to the implementation of ESAP.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The technical advice on civil prospectus liability presents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>feedback received on the CfE &nbsp;where many stakeholders consider that the current regime is well-balanced and argue that reform is unnecessary at this stage;</span></li>
<li><span>ESMA&rsquo;s ensuing advice; and</span></li>
<li><span>an update of the sections of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2015/11/2013-619_report_liability_regimes_under_the_prospectus_directive_published_on_website.pdf">2013 Report on prospectus liability</a><span>&nbsp;related to civil prospectus liability.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESMA has submitted the reports to the European Commission (EC). On the proposals to update the data reporting requirements in line with changes introduced by the Listing Act, the EC shall take a decision on whether to adopt the RTS updating&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/979/oj/eng">Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/979</a><span>&nbsp;within three months. The Commission may extend that period by one month.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In relation to the technical advice on the civil prospectus liability, the EC must present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 31 December 2025. This should analyse the issue of liability for the information given in a prospectus, assessing whether further harmonisation of the prospectus liability in the Union could be warranted.</span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published newly developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA42-1710566791-6103_Principles_on_third-party_risks.pdf">Principles on third-party risks supervision</a>. These principles aim at supporting a common and effective EU-wide supervisory culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The 14 principles on third-party risks were developed to address the growing risks observed over recent years in the use of outsourcing, delegation or other types of third-party services by supervised firms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The principles provide a&nbsp;</span>common supervisory basis to<span>&nbsp;National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and ESMA, enhancing the robustness of supervisory frameworks and help supervised entities understand and manage third-party risks.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Going forward, ESMA will support the progressive implementation of the principles through supervisory discussions and case studies among NCAs.</span></p>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Statement Before The Senate Finance Committee</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the committee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today. Treasury is committed to working with Congress to improve our nation&rsquo;s finances, create new jobs, and strengthen the economy. We look forward to coordinating with you on the President&rsquo;s Budget and his tax priorities in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this effort, I wish to highlight today the Treasury Department&rsquo;s efforts to advance President Trump&rsquo;s economic agenda on tax and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Treasury has just completed its most successful tax filing season in years&mdash;and we did so while improving efficiencies and cutting costs at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics of the President&rsquo;s efforts to modernize the IRS warned that the effort would result in a 10% shortfall in receipts. Instead, the opposite happened. April receipts this year were up 9.5% over the previous year. And receipts in May were up 14.7% over the previous year. Most remarkably, the President was able to achieve these results while reducing $2 billion in waste and planned IT spending at the IRS.</p>
<p>This success has taken place against the backdrop of one of the most consequential tax proposals ever to come before Congress: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and businesses with certainty and build economic momentum. The legislation is squarely aimed at boosting the working and middle class and reinvigorating American manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the One Big Beautiful Bill will raise&nbsp;take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the average worker. And it will cement no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and tax cuts for seniors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill will also incentivize unprecedented investment in US manufacturing. The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made-in-America. And it will streamline burdensome permitting processes that often stand in the way of new manufacturing projects. It&rsquo;s time for this country to start building things again&mdash;and the One Big Beautiful Bill makes this possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is grateful for the House&rsquo;s efforts to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill. We now look forward to working closely with this committee and other members of the Senate to get this legislation to the President&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade is the second topic I wish to highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progress we have made on tax issues over the last four months complements the significant progress we have made in rebalancing the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I last testified before Congress in May, the President announced the historic US-UK trade deal. This arrangement&mdash;which creates a $5 billion export opportunity for American ranchers, farmers, and manufacturers&mdash;is a preview of what&rsquo;s to come. Dozens of countries have engaged the administration thus far with offers to improve their trade relations with the United States. This includes China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the early hours of the morning, I returned from successful negotiations in London with the Chinese delegation. I am confident these negotiations will bring balance to the economic relationship between our two economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has a singular opportunity to stabilize its economy by shifting away from excess production towards greater consumption. But the country needs to be a reliable partner in trade negotiations. If China will course-correct by upholding its end of the initial trade agreement we outlined in Geneva&mdash;and I believe after our talks in London they will&mdash;then a rebalancing of the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By challenging the decades-old status quo on tax and trade, President Trump is breathing new life into the American economy. More than&nbsp;500,000 private-sector payroll&nbsp;jobs have been added since January. Most importantly, inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy. After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration&rsquo;s policies. Furthermore, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and plentiful labor demand as job openings remain high. This strength has been exemplified in the recent performance of the stock market and consumer confidence data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s bold leadership on these issues has laid the foundation for a Golden Age economy. With your help, we can build on that foundation to create even greater prosperity and abundance for the American people. We hope you will join us in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

The ETF tracks the Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index, which is designed to capture the transformative potential of companies driving the global AI economy. This launch builds on the influential research and thematic vision of Dan Ives, whose expertise in the technology sector played a pivotal role in shaping the index&rsquo;s design and focus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The artificial intelligence sector stands at a critical juncture, with generative AI and automation technologies fueling innovation across both enterprise and consumer markets. The growing adoption of AI&mdash;by both established technology leaders and emerging disruptors&mdash;presents a compelling thematic investment opportunity focused on long-term growth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0QRU2">Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index</a>&nbsp;is constructed using the research of acclaimed tech analyst Dan Ives, and leverages ARTIS&reg;, the Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing technology, to identify U.S.-listed companies that are significant enablers or adopters of AI. To be eligible, companies must be included in the Dan Ives AI Revolution Theme Research Report and meet defined thresholds for market capitalization and trading volume. The index applies a modified market capitalization weighting approach, ensuring diversified and meaningful exposure to the full AI value chain&mdash;including cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software, cybersecurity, and data analytics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ETF was listed on 4<span>th</span>&nbsp;June on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol IVES.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steffen Scheuble, Chief Executive Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Developing the Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index for Wedbush reflects our focus on supporting clients with precise and research-driven indexing solutions. This mandate demonstrates the value of combining thematic expertise with robust, rules-based index construction to address evolving investor demand around transformational themes such as artificial intelligence.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Matt Bromberg, Chief Operating Officer of Wedbush Fund Advisers, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Wedbush Fund Advisers is thrilled to have collaborated with Solactive AG, an innovator and long-time leader in indexing, to create an index using the Dan Ives AI 30 Research Report and Dan Ives&rsquo; picks among significant creators, enablers or adopters of artificial intelligence technologies, as its starting point, creating a first of its kind ETF powered by this proprietary research&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R8ZP7BnXNF6IKfNBbJG9kX9iOxc5jcZaDtvOo0TBYQFgoka8ZPBOor3uKa_Q5iiKY_3t5AnEkFF3yHmYZlPuDCpUiLyiuWElHjF3lcXfm8ycU3RKG2BJF58o2HXYMPOM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for May 2025. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly increase in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,835 in May, which is up 2.1% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, North American corporate requests were up 3.7% over May 2024 totals. The monthly increase was driven by an 8.2% rise in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers, a 13.8% increase in requests for certificates of deposit (CDs) with maturities shorter than one year and a 5.7% increase in requests for CDs with maturities longer than one year.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 24.6% versus April totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 21.3% through the end of May. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 154 new CUSIP requests in May, followed by New York (113) and California (109).</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the jury still out on the future of potential interest rate cuts in the U.S., issuers were coming to the market at a healthy clip in May,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;Perhaps most noteworthy is the monthly surge we&rsquo;ve seen in request volume for new short-term CD identifiers, which suggests that at least some market participants are banking on high rates sticking around for a while longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 23.3% in May and international debt CUSIP requests rose 21.1%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 18.2% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 14.5%.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Global broker XM reassures clients in Singapore that &ldquo;no action is required on their part&rdquo; and their &ldquo;funds remain safe&rdquo;, following a recent announcement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), that has led to internet service providers potentially blocking access to XM&rsquo;s website from 20 June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAS has determined that XM and other brokers had been offering leveraged financial products to Singapore&rsquo;s residents without a local capital markets services license<b>. XM has clarified that it is licensed and regulated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Belize in the provision of online investment services globally, it's also important to note that the website does not contain information specifically directed at persons residing in Singapore, and the company has no servers or physical presence in Singapore</b>.</p>
<p>Recognised globally for its reliability and professionalism, XM has been serving traders across more than 190 countries for over 15 years. With a client base exceeding 15 million, the broker has built a strong reputation by prioritising transparency, client satisfaction, and long-term relationships within the trading community. XM also adheres to strict rules and regulations and has robust security measures for protecting client funds and offering reliable platforms and services.</p>
<p>While respecting the authority of MAS, XM emphasized its ongoing commitment to regulatory cooperation and transparency and it is currently assessing the implications of this development with legal advisors, to determine if any action is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continued Access Under International Regulation&nbsp;</p>
<p>XM&rsquo;s platform is operated by XM Global Limited, which is regulated by the FSC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Singapore&rsquo;s law, individuals may opt to use the trading services offered by regulated foreign brokers. This means trading accounts, payment methods, and all services will remain fully functional for Singapore-based clients after 20 June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<b><i>We remain fully committed to supporting our clients in Singapore</i></b>&rdquo;, an XM spokesperson said. <b><i>&ldquo;Our Customer Experience Team is available 24/7 to answer questions and we will ensure uninterrupted access to all trading services, regardless of any changes</i></b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Global pricing and billing platform leader SunTec Business Solutions today announced a strategic relationship with Curinos, a trusted provider of financial data intelligence and optimization solutions, to embed market insights directly into the core decision-making processes of banks and credit unions.</p>
<p>As financial institutions navigate heightened competition, margin pressure, and shifting customer expectations, the ability to act on more timely, accurate data has never been more essential. By integrating Curinos&rsquo; Treasury Management and Commercial Deposit Analyzer benchmarks within SunTec&rsquo;s Modern Account Analysis and Deal Pricing products, this relationship gives banks and credit unions a new edge in pricing strategy, one that is more agile, smarter, and deeply rooted in market reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commercial banks are being asked to do more with less - win and retain business, defend margins, and move with agility,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Amit Dua, President of SunTec.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Through this relationship with Curinos, we&rsquo;re turning pricing into a strategic lever by putting market intelligence directly in the hands of treasury sales teams, product managers, and pricing officers, right within their workflows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Driving Precision Across the Pricing Lifecycle</b></p>
<p>Banks leveraging the combined power of SunTec and Curinos can expect transformative benefits across the revenue management lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Market-Aligned Deal Pricing</b>: Relationship managers and treasury sales teams will have access to Curinos&rsquo; proprietary benchmarks while pricing complex commercial deals within SunTec&rsquo;s platform, making negotiations more precise and data-backed.</li>
<li><b>Data-Driven Product Strategy</b>: Product managers can analyze revenue and profitability trends, benchmarked against the market, to refine pricing strategies and align offerings to institutional goals.</li>
<li><b>Client-Level Impact Analysis</b>: Proposed pricing changes can be evaluated at the customer level, allowing bankers to accept or reject changes before routing them for approval, bringing new levels of agility to pricing governance and client engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Banks need actionable data, not static dashboards,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Margarita Vacanti, SVP, Head of Commercial Banking at Curinos</b>. &ldquo;Our relationship with SunTec delivers just that: embedded analytics where they matter most, at the point of decision. It&rsquo;s about enabling smarter pricing, more confident renewals, and a tighter alignment between strategy and execution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Members discussed vulnerabilities in the global financial system, issues related to non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), crypto-assets, climate-related financial risks, and resolution.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Financial stability outlook</h3>
<p>Financial markets have largely stabilised following the sudden and severe spike in market volatility in April 2025 that followed the announcement of US trade tariffs and retaliatory action by some other jurisdictions. The episode illustrated how elevated asset prices, which were highlighted as a vulnerability in recent FSB work, can be susceptible to a sudden unwind in the event of an external shock. Plenary members noted that financial markets remained resilient through this episode, despite much higher trading volumes. Nevertheless, members cautioned that there remains a risk of further market strains given the uncertainty about the economic outlook and the potential for unexpected policy changes.</p>
<p>Members also highlighted key vulnerabilities requiring attention in the coming months. Debt levels, in particular government debt, are high, and debt dynamics are projected to worsen in a number of jurisdictions. Potential vulnerabilities from leverage and liquidity mismatches in parts of the NBFI sector remain, while operational failures can impact critical parts of the financial system. Growing interlinkages between crypto-asset markets and the financial system and increasing use cases for stablecoins warrant closer monitoring.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Non-bank financial intermediation</h3>
<p>The Plenary reviewed the FSB&rsquo;s upcoming recommendations on NBFI leverage, which will be delivered to the G20 in July, and discussed the medium-term work plan aimed at enhancing resilience in NBFI.</p>
<p>Taking forward the FSB&rsquo;s work programme to enhance the resilience of NBFI depends heavily on reliable data. In the course of its work, the FSB has identified several data challenges that have hindered the effective assessment of nonbank sector vulnerabilities by authorities. The FSB has set up a high-level task force, the Nonbank Data Task Force &ndash; chaired by incoming FSB Chair Andrew Bailey &ndash; to address these challenges. The Plenary received an update on the Taskforce&rsquo;s work and approved a near-term focus on use of leverage in government bond markets.</p>
<p>The FSB will publish a report in July detailing progress on its overall NBFI work programme, and a report outlining its workplan to address nonbank data challenges.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FSB work programme updates</h3>
<p>The Plenary discussed progress on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025 and received updates on key initiatives from its committees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Plenary reviewed the status of the&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-climate-related-financial-risks/">FSB Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks</a>, on which the FSB has been asked to provide a progress report to the July G20 meeting. As part of annual work programme discussions, FSB members will continue to evaluate how the analysis of topics, such as physical risks and gaps in insurance coverage, may contribute to a better understanding of financial stability risks.</p>
<p>Members received updates on the implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s global recommendations and the ongoing crypto thematic peer review, which will be delivered to the G20 later this year.</p>
<p>The Plenary also discussed progress on the Resolution Steering Group&rsquo;s key initiatives and future priorities. Members expressed support for ongoing efforts to strengthen resolution effectiveness and enhance crisis preparedness.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia’s Audit Oversight Board Suspends Chengco And Sanctions Auditors From Auditing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysias-audit-oversight-board-suspends-chengco-and-sanc-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysias-audit-oversight-board-suspends-chengco-and-sanc-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia&rsquo;s Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has suspended the registration of Chengco PLT (AF 0886) (CCO) for two years due to serious audit quality issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AOB also imposed sanctions against five of CCO&rsquo;s audit partners who were the engagement partners and engagement quality control reviewers (ECQR) of three public interest entities (PIEs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It suspended Hong Thuan Boon and Yap Peng Boon for two years. It also prohibited Tan Wae Leng, Kong Tung Sam and Ng Kee Siang from accepting as clients and auditing any PIEs or schedule funds for one year.</p>
<p>The sanctions followed the AOB&rsquo;s findings of multiple breaches in relation to CCO&rsquo;s failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as adopted by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) when auditing the three PIEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, the findings were in fundamental and key audit areas. These include failures to obtain sufficient audit evidence in areas such as bank borrowings, opening balances and prior year adjustments, use of going concern assumption, other payables and accruals, revenue, cost of sales, redeemable convertible preference shares and goodwill.</p>
<p>Recurring audit deficiencies were also found in the areas of property development costs and fixed deposits.</p>
<p>In addition, the EQCR failed to sufficiently review key audit documentation, particularly those relating to significant judgements and risk areas. This had an adverse effect on overall audit quality.</p>
<p>These findings were prevalent across the audit engagements inspected and some were recurring from the AOB&rsquo;s past inspection on CCO. Despite being previously sanctioned by the AOB in 2019, CCO failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall audit quality. Hong Thuan Boon and Yap Peng Boon were also previously sanctioned by the AOB in 2019.</p>
<p>CCO appealed to the SC against the AOB&rsquo;s enforcement action. The SC dismissed the appeal and affirmed the AOB&rsquo;s decision. The suspension took effect from 12 June 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The affected partners did not appeal the AOB&rsquo;s enforcement action. Their suspensions and prohibitions were effective concurrently from 30 April 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Customers Are Key – Super Trustees Need To Listen And Act Now - Keynote Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The AmCham Regulator Luncheon Series In Sydney On 12 June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Super funds hold the keys to the future for millions of lives and are another link in the chain that binds Australia and the US. But sadly, our work across the sector has exposed its shortcomings and blind spots.</li>
<li>The next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s work in the superannuation sector will address how trustees learn from and respond to the complaints they receive.</li>
<li>A trustee&rsquo;s approach to complaints is a clear and meaningful measure of whether they&rsquo;re focused on the interests of their members. Customer-centric means complaint-aware.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are on Gadigal Country. I pay my respects to Elders past and present &ndash; and I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past decade, Australia&rsquo;s total superannuation assets have grown to more than $4.1 trillion in funds, giving super a larger market capitalisation than all companies on the ASX.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly an impressive achievement.</p>
<p>And its growth, alongside the universal nature of superannuation and its preservation until retirement, makes super a pillar of stability for the Australian economy.</p>
<p>But quantity isn&rsquo;t everything. We must have quality too. Size and growth should not outstrip governance &ndash; nor customer service.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s here that we&rsquo;re seeing a great divide between what can be reasonably expected of super funds, and what is found in practice.</p>
<p>Superannuation is currently the subject of significant regulatory and enforcement action from both ASIC and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</p>
<p>So today I want to address that divide head-on.</p>
<h2>The role super plays in the economy</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the role of super in the economy.</p>
<p>Australia doesn&rsquo;t make it into the top 50 countries in the world when it comes to population size. We&rsquo;re 55<sup>th</sup>. And yet our super industry constitutes the fourth largest retirement savings pool in the world, surpassed only by the US, the UK, and Canada. And by the next decade we&rsquo;re expected to have the second largest retirement system globally.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>It's no surprise, then, that super is growing faster than our economy and is larger than our GDP.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
<p>Our regulatory settings have contributed to the strong growth of the sector &ndash; and, more broadly, for many years super has played a role in intermediating retail investor participation in public and private markets &ndash; more about that later &ndash; and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>On this point, ASIC is currently looking at super and its role in the future shape of our public and private markets and what, if anything, ASIC needs to do to improve confident investor participation in those markets.</p>
<p>Given its size, Australia&rsquo;s super system has emerged as a significant force in our local capital markets, as well as those abroad. Over the last decade super funds&rsquo; investment allocations to international public equities went from 21% to 30%, surpassing domestic public equities investment.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>And of course, given the size and depth of its economy, the United States is a natural destination for this capital.</p>
<p>Which means Australians aren&rsquo;t the only beneficiaries of the super system. More and more Australian capital is behind American infrastructure projects, data centres, and energy and technology businesses. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macquarie Asset Management, which works with 18 out of the 20 largest superannuation funds in Australia, owns the Long Beach Container Terminal in California and the Goethals Bridge linking New York and New Jersey.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, this means our funds can be increasingly exposed to assets that don&rsquo;t perform as expected &ndash; AustralianSuper&rsquo;s recent $1.1 billion write-down in the US software company Pluralsight being one example.</p>
<p>But in any case, it&rsquo;s clear that the super industry, given its scale and focus in both the Australian and American economies, is another link in the chain that binds our two nations closer together.</p>
<p>On that note - I know that questions around trade, tariffs, defence, and critical minerals may be on the minds of many in this room. As Australia&rsquo;s corporate and markets regulator, ASIC of course has no direct role in relation to those issues.</p>
<p>However, an important part of the work we do requires close-knit international collaboration, and we have strong, enduring and mutually beneficial partnerships with US regulators &ndash; particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>We work together &ndash; including across international forums &ndash; on common global market issues, such as scams and fraud, the use of AI, fintech innovation, and the dynamics we&rsquo;re seeing between public and private markets.</p>
<p>We also engage regularly on supervision strategies, investigations and general enforcement approaches.</p>
<p>As a regulator, this collaboration is critical to ensuring strong markets and ultimately Australia and America&rsquo;s prosperity.</p>
<h2>Super trustees are failing Australians in a critical service</h2>
<p>The size and scale of the super industry alone would put it in a position to have a unique influence on the economy &ndash; and thus the lives of everyday Australians whose money it holds. But that money is also the life savings, the retirement funds, of most of our citizenry &ndash; money entrusted to superannuation funds in good faith to be preserved for when the time comes to retire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that super funds hold the keys to the future for millions of lives &ndash; and so they&rsquo;re trusted with all the responsibilities and obligations that go with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for the super sector to be rightly praised for the returns it generates from its investments. But the real value of those investments is what they actually represent to Australians: the hope of a comfortable, secure retirement after a lifetime of hard work &ndash;&ndash; and the promise that their money will be there when needed.</p>
<p>But sadly, our work across the sector has exposed its shortcomings and blind spots.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s work has laid bare governance challenges, and exposed super trustee board blind spots around their data, systems, and processes. For example, our death benefits review found that even the fastest trustees processed less than half (48%) of their death benefit claims within three months. The slowest processed only 8% in that time.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, that&rsquo;s a long time for your loved ones to be waiting to be paid your money if they need to make ends meet.</p>
<p>A total of&nbsp;<strong>zero</strong>&nbsp;trustees in our review monitored or reported on end-to-end death benefit claims handling times. Nor did they have performance objectives for these times.</p>
<p>Many trustees didn&rsquo;t even monitor how long their open death benefit claims had been going &ndash; was a claim 90 days old or 500 days old? If the trustees had done that &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>as we did</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; they would have found that claims went unresolved for months and sometimes years.</p>
<p>And importantly &ndash; it was an increase in complaints that led to our review of death benefits claims handling. Service complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) about death benefit claims more than tripled in a two-year period<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, and in 2023 we saw an increase in these same complaints in trustees&rsquo; internal dispute resolution data.</p>
<p>If trustees had acted on this data &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>as we did</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; they may not be facing enforcement action today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about anything new here &ndash; we&rsquo;re talking about well-established principles of governance and responsibility. When we published our &lsquo;Better banking for Indigenous consumers&rsquo; report,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[8]</sup></a>&nbsp;we highlighted the ways banks were failing to put their customers first. When we published our report on financial hardship,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp;we highlighted the same failings by lenders.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes we hear from funds that further investment in data, systems, and processes is too costly or too difficult. For example, one trustee has delayed investing in a better workflow tracking and reporting capability for close to three years &ndash; even after external advice identified deficiencies. The new capability was needed to improve a critical member service.</p>
<p>But the risks of not investing are just too great. It&rsquo;s in the interest of all Australians to have well-run, resilient superannuation funds. So let me be clear on this point &ndash; ASIC isn&rsquo;t going to question critical investments in data, systems, and processes that are essential to the delivery of member services.</p>
<p>But you can expect we&rsquo;ll question their absence.</p>
<p>All this points to the cold hard truth that super trustees have to get a grip on their data, systems, and processes. They have to know what&rsquo;s going on in their own business.</p>
<p>That is why ASIC has been calling on the sector to improve, following an ongoing thread of governance failures. And why we warmly welcome the government&rsquo;s proposed mandatory and enforceable service standards to drive improvement in trustee conduct.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s next phase of work &ndash; complaints information</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why the&nbsp;<strong>next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s work in the superannuation sector is to address these &lsquo;board blind spots&rsquo;</strong>. Specifically,&nbsp;<strong>our focus is on how trustees learn from and respond to the complaints they receive</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Because no business can thrive without understanding the people it serves. To do this, it needs market feedback. And a primary source of this feedback is &ndash; and always will be &ndash; customer complaints. A trustee&rsquo;s approach to complaints is a clear and meaningful measure of whether they&rsquo;re focused on the interests of their members. It also indicates the maturity of the trustee&rsquo;s approach to risk. That&rsquo;s why ASIC has been urging industry to act on complaints for some time now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget, it&rsquo;s already an enforceable requirement to regularly analyse complaint data to identify systemic issues.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[11]</sup></a>&nbsp;<strong>This is member services 101.</strong>&nbsp;So a failure of data, systems, and processes doesn&rsquo;t just let their members down &ndash; it means trustees are failing to comply with their obligations. And, where appropriate, ASIC will pursue enforcement action in response to that failure.</p>
<p>After all, super trustees have an obligation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>act honestly</li>
<li>exercise the same degree of care, skill, and diligence as a prudent trustee, and</li>
<li>perform duties and exercise powers in the best financial interests of beneficiaries.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[12]</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, they&rsquo;re required to act efficiently, honestly, and fairly in providing a super trustee service.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&nbsp;But&nbsp;<strong>none of this is possible without the right information</strong>. That&rsquo;s why trustees&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;have robust arrangements in place to oversee how complaints are being handled, to be able to interrogate complaint data and have confidence that systemic issues are being addressed.</p>
<p>For the executives in the room who aren&rsquo;t working for super trustees, just change the word &lsquo;trustee&rsquo; to &lsquo;company&rsquo; in a lot of what I&rsquo;ve said, and know that ASIC is just as focused on how you&rsquo;re supporting&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the right information to make good judgements, you simply cannot govern effectively. It&rsquo;s that fundamental. So if management isn&rsquo;t collecting or providing that information &ndash; trustee board directors need to be demanding it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no good having a policy of acting in the customer&rsquo;s best interest if it&rsquo;s not practiced. It was an increase in complaints that led to our review of death benefits claims handling. That increase should have led to a review by the funds themselves.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t. Why? Because they didn&rsquo;t know. So I repeat &ndash; without systems in place for collecting, tracking and analysing the right information, you simply can&rsquo;t fulfil your obligations.</p>
<p>Again and again we return to the same theme: customer-centric or member-centric can&rsquo;t be lip service. It has to be lived, day in, day out. And customer-centric means complaint-aware.</p>
<h2>Conclusion &ndash; reading the riot act</h2>
<p>I was recently described in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Review&nbsp;</em>as &lsquo;reading the riot act to big super.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&nbsp;This is, of course, a reference to the Riot Act of 1715, which permitted an officer of the law to disperse any crowd &ldquo;unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled together&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While we usually see the phrase used to describe someone being told off, the original law required the Riot Act to be read to the crowd&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;any attempt was made to disperse it. Once the Act had been read, however, if the crowd failed to follow its command, all of those present were guilty of a felony. Which means that &lsquo;reading the riot act&rsquo; actually is more than a telling-off &ndash; it&rsquo;s a warning to stop making trouble or there&rsquo;ll be more trouble.</p>
<p>So consider this speech a reminder that ASIC has read the riot act to the super industry. Super plays a crucial role in the Australian economy. It holds the trust &ndash; and the savings &ndash; of millions of Australian families, mums and dads, the old and the young. The industry has a solemn responsibility to protect the interests of all Australians, and to give them every confidence their money will be there, readily available, when it&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>To the extent that some trustees aren&rsquo;t across the data, systems, and processes of their funds, they&rsquo;re failing to live up to that solemn responsibility.</p>
<p>To that extent, they&rsquo;re causing more trouble and suffering for their members &ndash; their customers.</p>
<p>And to that extent, there will be trouble &ndash; for any trustees who fail to know their business, inside and out, and to act in the best interests of their members.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&rsquo;s Investor Forum will demonstrate ASX&rsquo;s solid momentum in progressing our FY28 New Era strategy.</p>
<p>As we approach the third year of our five year strategy, ASX&rsquo;s senior management team will give a detailed update on key aspects of our strategic deliverables, including progress against our technology modernisation program. Investors will also receive financial guidance and hear more about growth opportunities across ASX&rsquo;s lines of business.</p>
<p><b>ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse said</b>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasing to be at the stage in our strategy where we can show steady progress of key deliverables. This is particularly the case for our technology modernisation program and in the way we&rsquo;ve been engaging with our customers and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have a way to go, and there are areas such as operational risk and business resilience where we are redoubling our efforts and making further investment. Getting this right will secure our foundations for growth and we&rsquo;ve established the new Accelerate Program to drive delivery of these outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each line of business presentation will provide detail on their market dynamics and opportunities. This year&rsquo;s Investor Forum will also include a discussion on the importance of our EBITDA margin, which will sit alongside underlying ROE as a key performance metric for the organisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Lofthouse said: &ldquo;Our revenue growth ambition and ongoing focus on expense management are drivers of the financial measure of success for ASX, and we are targeting EBITDA margin percentage expansion over the medium term.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Key financial information and guidance</h4>
<ul>
<li>FY25 total expense growth rate expected to be at mid-point of previously provided guidance range of between 6% and 9%;</li>
<li>FY25 operating expense growth expected to be at mid-point of guidance range of between 4% and 7%;</li>
<li>ASX is guiding to FY26 total expense growth range of between 8% and 11%, with FY26 operating expense growth rate of between 4% and 7% which reflects the same range as FY25;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Key drivers of FY26 operating expense growth rate include increase in technology costs from software license charges, costs associated with delivery of Accelerate Program and legal costs associated with ongoing ASIC actions;</li>
<li>FY25 capital expenditure expected to be within a narrowed range of between $170 million and $180 million, and remains within the original guidance provided<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Capital expenditure guidance for FY26 narrowed to a range of between $170 million and $180 million, with FY27&nbsp; range maintained at between $160 million and $180 million &ndash; this capex profile is in line with previously provided guidance and ASX&rsquo;s intention is for this to reduce after FY27;</li>
<li>Intention to maintain capital management settings for dividend payout ratio of between 80% and 90% of underlying net profit after tax, and potential operation of Dividend Reinvestment Plan;</li>
<li>Targeting EBITDA margin percentage to expand beyond the current level over the medium term;Underlying ROE remains key performance metric, medium target range of between 13.0% and 14.5%.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key operational highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>The project to replace CHESS continued to meet several milestones during the period including opening the first industry test environment for Release 1 in February &ndash; targeting go-live for Release 1 of Q4 FY26, now less than a year away;</li>
<li>Final stages of delivery for key Cash Market Trading project (Service Release 15) which will provide customers the benefit of a single opening auction;</li>
<li>Delivered ASX24 platform upgrade that improves interest rate futures liquidity;</li>
<li>Developed a new pricing policy for Clearing, Settlement and Issuer Services that continues to provide transparency regarding pricing for our customers and a reasonable return on the risks we take as a business;</li>
<li>Established Accelerate Program to bring pace and intensity to work which will further uplift operational risk management and resilience;</li>
<li>Continued execution of disciplined expense management initiatives expected to deliver annualised savings of ~$17 million into FY26 and targeting similar saving in FY27;</li>
<li>Ongoing Listings activity attracted total capital onto exchange of $79.0 billion for financial YTD to 31 May 2025 (after delisted capital for the same period of $54.3 billion, this delivered net new capital of $24.7 billion);</li>
<li>Created products to support the energy transition challenge with the launch of three environmental futures contracts and Wallumbilla natural gas futures;</li>
<li>Launched a new infrastructure service (ASX Colo OnDemand) that gives customers a new way to access the Australian Liquidity Centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to execute against our strategy, and our operating expenses and capex requirements are reflective of where we are in our five year plan. The investments we are making today are building the capabilities to drive revenue growth and underpin shareholder value in the longer term,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ASIC&rsquo;s Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets was held at the University of Technology Sydney Broadway campus on 10 June. The following facilitated Private markets, where to now? panel followed&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/opening-remarks-at-the-asic-symposium-on-australia-s-public-and-private-markets/" title="Opening remarks at the ASIC Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s Public and Private Markets">Joe Longo&rsquo;s remarks</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-symposium-panel-state-of-our-markets/" title="ASIC Symposium panel: State of Our Markets">State of Our Markets panel</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calissa Aldridge, Executive Director &ndash; Markets, ASIC:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for that thoughtful and insightful panel session. It&rsquo;s clear that public and private markets both play a critical role and are important for the future of our success here in Australia.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to move on to the second panel, so thank you, James, you can stay there. This next one&rsquo;s on private capital markets. These markets have obviously grown significantly over recent time, as our Chair outlined. They&rsquo;ve tripled in the last decade, for example. While off a low base in Australia, there&rsquo;s a consensus in the submissions that we received that there are structural changes, and something that we need to focus on.</p>
<p>So what opportunities does this change create for Australia and what does that mean for access to capital, investor protection and market integrity? This panel will explore all these questions, focusing on where private markets are going to head to, thinking about some of those opportunities and challenges that we need to confront.</p>
<p>So joining James are our four esteemed panel members. I welcome to the stage Simone Constant, ASIC Commissioner; Matthew Michelini, partner and Head of Asia Pacific at Apollo; Jason Collins, Managing Director, Head of Australia at BlackRock; and Peter Warne, Non-Executive Director of UniSuper, Virgin and a range of others. So thank you, over to you, James.</p>
<p><strong>James Thomson, AFR, Chanticleer Columnist:</strong>&nbsp;I just might need one more bottle of water here. Here we go. Well, we&rsquo;ve got a great panel here to really dig into the private markets side of things, which we gave you a bit of an entree in our first panel.</p>
<p>Peter, we could barely find a better placed panellist to talk about the crossover between public and private markets. You&rsquo;re the Director of UniSuper, which, of course, invests in both public and private markets. You&rsquo;re also the Chairman of Virgin, who Guy Fowler has helped steer onto the public markets and out of private ownership. From the perspective of a director, what are some of the differences between those two sides of the coin, and what&rsquo;s driving the growth in your mind in private markets?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Warne, Non-Executive Director, UniSuper:</strong>&nbsp;The big difference for a director is just the focus on scrutiny and reporting, and just think about the range of things a company, a listed company, has to do that an unlisted company doesn&rsquo;t have to do. Just go through the annual report setting, semi-annual results coming out, an annual general meeting, a remuneration report, continuous disclosure, following what the analysts are saying, so you have to advise the market if it&rsquo;s out of line with what your internal rates are. You have to have director elections. So they&rsquo;re all things I would call big R regulation.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a whole lot of other stuff which is small R regulation, which not much ASIC could do about that. But when you think about it, the shareholder communications, visiting shareholders regularly, the ASX corporate governance rules, which is getting a lot of play, which I mentioned several times. Talking to analysts, analyst conferences, road shows you have to do, going and seeing proxy advisors, all things which are not written in the corporations law, but every company has to do and it&rsquo;s expected that your public shareholders are going to have to do those sort of things. So it&rsquo;s just a huge time burden on management and on the board.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not talking yourself out of the role as Virgin Chairman, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, it&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Just given the super fund perspective on our last panel, do super funds need a thriving public market as well?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. There&rsquo;s no doubt about that. The vast majority of super fund assets, or the majority of super funds, are in the listed markets, either in equities, or whilst government bonds aren&rsquo;t listed, they&rsquo;re a public market and an actively traded market. So still the vast majority of assets are that way. In UniSuper&rsquo;s world, over 80% of its total assets are in the public markets in one way, shape or form. So they need it (a) for liquidity, and then (b) for just a price-setting mechanism that they have confidence in. So that is absolutely required.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Do you feel they&rsquo;re thriving at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Well, they&rsquo;re not growing as rapidly as they perhaps have been in the past. They&rsquo;re certainly still very active, and certainly people can get set in good volume when they want to, to either sell or buy. So they&rsquo;re still, I&rsquo;d say, in good shape. But they are not growing as fast as we would like to see them grow.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, fair enough. Jason, BlackRock&rsquo;s been a champion of public markets for decades, one of the great democratisers of public markets, really. But in the last few years, the business has made three big bets on private markets. Can you tell us why that&rsquo;s occurring inside the home of passive investing in public markets?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Collins, Managing Director, Head of Australia, BlackRock:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it&rsquo;s a massive strategic tilt that the company made last year. We announced three acquisitions, two of which have been completed. The first being Global Infrastructure Partners, a very large infrastructure player, quite large in Australia as well. The second is HPS, which has not been closed yet, but that&rsquo;s a large private credit business. And the third is Preqin, which is a data provider. And actually, five years ago, the company acquired another business called eFront, which is a technology company which really shines a light on portfolio holdings in private markets. So it actually looks at data from GPs and helps trustee boards and other organisations to understand what they own, so through funds and through vintages of funds.</p>
<p>So, yeah, a big strategic tilt. It was made for a couple of reasons. Very big-picture thinking from the founders of the firm. Essentially, they felt there was a mismatch between the demand for capital and the traditional sources of capital. And by that, I mean governments. Governments around the world have high debt-to-GDP levels, above 90% in the world. The US is 125%, Japan over 200%. It&rsquo;s quite well known. Governments around the world have reducing tax bases as well. You&rsquo;ve got, in the EU, 22 of 27 member states, the working-age population&rsquo;s declining. You&rsquo;ve got, in Australia, one in 10 people will retire in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>So with high debt-to-GDP, a lower taxation base in the future, there&rsquo;s a real need for private capital to meet some pretty critical needs in the global economy in infrastructure. So really big-picture thinking around how to solve this mismatch. And I can go into why there&rsquo;s such a critical need for private markets at the moment in infrastructure, but that&rsquo;s kind of the thinking behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and just in Australia, does the business reflect that tilt? Like your Australian operations, is there a lot of that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Collins:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing. I started BlackRock 12 years ago, and the first seven years of my life was selling BlackRock to Australia. And the last five years, I&rsquo;ve been selling Australia to BlackRock. And on the ground now, we have a massive private markets investor presence, coming up to 50 investors, about $30 billion of assets deployed in private markets in Australia. We actually invest around $280 billion in Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets. 80% of that money is actually from offshore investors.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a huge voice now in the policy settings for foreign investors. And our business here used to be a product and distribution business. It&rsquo;s now an investing business. It&rsquo;s now a technology business to reflect the fact that we&rsquo;re actually facilitating so much foreign flows into the country.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah. Matthew, Apollo makes no bones about which side of the fence it&rsquo;s &ndash; you sit on. I&rsquo;m not sure if people have read Apollo&rsquo;s submission, but it basically calls the public markets in Australia little more than a concentrated bet on a few miners and four-bit banks. Which I love, being for its honesty, if nothing else. But tell us a little bit about the sort of global boom in private capital, and how that is changing the market down here.</p>
<p>Matthew Michelini, Head of Asia Pacific, Apollo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure. By the way, it&rsquo;s not just the Australian market. It&rsquo;s markets everywhere. A lot of what the last panel talked about or touched on, and a lot about what this panel is touching on, is actually about portfolio construction. And it used to be OK to put publics together. 60% equities, 40% bonds, and maybe a little bit of risk. And that was because when you bought the S&amp;P, you were buying into a diversified stream of cash flows in companies that represented the underlying economy. In the debt markets, something very similar.</p>
<p>The challenge is that the structure of the markets changed quite significantly over the last 20 years. And so when all this portfolio application theory came out 20 years ago, you could put a 60-40 portfolio together, you could get a diversified stream of cash flows, you could get stocks and bonds correlating negatively, so you had somewhat of a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>As the structure changed, at the same time you had every central bank across the globe print money. You had every government going into a fiscal deficit. Most of that surplus went into the financial markets. There&rsquo;s very few places that can absorb all that liquidity. It&rsquo;s the European markets, it&rsquo;s the Chinese markets, it&rsquo;s the US markets, it&rsquo;s commodities. And then you start to have smaller tier two markets that can&rsquo;t absorb all that liquidity.</p>
<p>So the public markets, by and large, became indexed, correlated, concentrated, all driven by passive money. Passive money is effectively daily liquid funds that buy when they get inflows, sell when they get outflows, irrespective of the underlying cash flows of the business.</p>
<p>And so the question is not whether concentration, as the last panel talked about, is it good or bad. The question is, is it a fact? And so how do you achieve diversification? How do you not lever a big chunk of a retirement system, a big chunk of an individual savings to NVIDIA, which can lose $800 billion in a given day? And so every investor across the world is asking, how do I get diversification in my portfolio?</p>
<p>The easiest way to get diversification right now is adding privates. And that didn&rsquo;t used to be the case, by the way. Privates really used to just be the venture capital hedge funds, private equity. But what the US did, and what you&rsquo;re seeing Europe do, and even what you&rsquo;re seeing Australia do a little bit, is you&rsquo;re seeing governments ask the private markets to step up and do more, and the banks to do less. And so now you have private markets that range from AAA-rated risk, all the way down to equity. So you can create a diversified portfolio with publics and privates at all points along the risk-reward spectrum.</p>
<p>I think that another mention was made by Raph about the over-indexation to US markets. You&rsquo;re going to need other sources of diversification. All of a sudden, now you need currency diversification, and so on and so forth. But the biggest and easiest way to get diversification in a portfolio is a blend of public and privates.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, Matt. Simone, one thing I really like about the prices that ASIC&rsquo;s been through is, as Joe said, you try to really keep an open mind, not prejudge the outcome. You&rsquo;ve seen all the 90 submissions, including the 40 that are private. You&rsquo;ve done 40 meetings, I believe, with industry participants. What&rsquo;s surprised you about the private market feedback, particularly?</p>
<p><strong>Simone Constant, Commissioner, ASIC:</strong>&nbsp;I would say the biggest surprise was probably an upside surprise in terms of the number of submissions and the quality. Now, I say surprise; I actually hoped it would be that. I often say publicly I&rsquo;m a big believer in Australia&rsquo;s financial system and all the participants, and I think you can see that from the attendance tonight. But it didn&rsquo;t mean I expected that to come through.</p>
<p>So I think to get 90 submissions, which we did, 50, as you say, public, 40 private, and then to have had so much engagement as well. And the meetings, the engagement, some of those with people who put in submissions, who said, do you want to come and talk to us about it, do you want to spend some time, including folks actually who are here with me this evening. The quality and breadth of the submissions as well, though.</p>
<p>I think some of them, some of the submissions, you mentioned the Apollo submission. Let&rsquo;s be honest, the Apollo submission was extraordinary, I think, and the amount of time and thinking that went into it. So there was a quality of the submissions, but the breadth. Every industry, I think, was, every part of the financial services industry was covered. We had firms, we had super funds, we had banks, we had &ndash; even insurers responded. Obviously, there were lobby groups, as you mentioned. Individuals, and we heard from an individual tonight. So just the people who took the time.</p>
<p>And I think in terms of actual surprises in what we read, I think I got surprised, pleasantly surprised about the interest from offshore. And you can see we&rsquo;ve got Blackrock and Apollo here tonight. That&rsquo;s no coincidence. It was a real pleasant surprise that offshore, we had such big global players so interested in our markets that they took this so seriously.</p>
<p>And I think also the numbers. So we were honest when we put out the discussion paper and said, we&rsquo;re probably not getting the numbers right. We don&rsquo;t have the data to do so. What was really confronting, though, was a few of the submissions, including some of the super funds, including the Apollo submission, said you&rsquo;re way off. You should be thinking about it this way.</p>
<p>And one of the numbers that stood out to me was that 96% of Australian companies that earn over $100 mil in a year, they&rsquo;re private. That&rsquo;s really significant. When you look at the employment numbers, it&rsquo;s about 85% of people are employed in the private. So the way to think about the size of the private prize, I think, was probably a surprise for me as well.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Does that raise any concerns that something you weren&rsquo;t entirely worried about being systemic, might actually be closer to systemic than you think?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. So I think what wasn&rsquo;t a surprise was the number of responses that said, look, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about this part, or you don&rsquo;t need to worry about this part. You expected that, and that&rsquo;s great. We invited everyone&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Another thing that did surprise me, actually, was the number of submissions that said, actually, this is something you should be worried about. And one area which really came through with maturity were the number of private credit, for example, private credit participants, who said, actually, you should be thinking about a bit more, if not regulation, more transparency in the private credit space.</p>
<p>And some of that was geared toward end investor. Some of that was geared toward protection or awareness and transparency to borrower. But some of that absolutely was geared toward, you need to really confront how significant this is. It may not be a problem, but you need to know the size of this wall in case it becomes one.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Peter, there&rsquo;s clearly some regulatory differences, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d call them differences or gaps, between public and private, but which ones sort of stand out to you? And do you have a sense of whether we need to close, we need to regulate these two markets more similarly? Just grab your mic there, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>Warne:&nbsp;</strong>The couple of gaps that really stand out, I think, are valuation. Public market valuations are the last traded price at the 30th of June for one BHP share. Whereas if you&rsquo;ve got valuation of properties, for example, the valuers look at what the last time that a property like that traded, which could have been two years before. And it just is ridiculous. I mean, we saw that in spades post the 2022 rise in interest rates. All the listed REITs were down 30%, but the on-balance-sheet single property valuations stayed constant for another 18 months. I mean, that&rsquo;s just ludicrous. And that really calls into question, I think, private markets when valuations are so clearly different.</p>
<p>So I think a clearer definition, and maybe it&rsquo;s a gift for ASIC, that could be really clear about what we&rsquo;re valuing here. What is the real purpose of the valuation in private markets? Is it what we think that we could sell this particular asset for on the 30th of June, as opposed to what the latest model said, or the latest time we saw a property like that sell? I think there&rsquo;s some clarity on that.</p>
<p>And then more clarity on the real liquidity attributes of particular assets. I think Raph talked about this a lot. And when we&rsquo;re offering through super funds at least one day, if not three-day, liquidity on assets, clearly, if you&rsquo;re trying to sell the whole asset in the market, it would take six months. I think we have to be very careful about that. We need some better definitions of what liquidity are, what valuation is, and really more transparency about what the true investment process is. I think they&rsquo;re all gaps, I think, that could do with tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Matt, Peter&rsquo;s taken us to the issue of valuation, which you must get a lot. And I know there&rsquo;s differences in the regulatory framework between the US and Australia at the moment. What does good regulatory intervention look like around valuations and transparency?</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:</strong>&nbsp;Look, I think there&rsquo;s &ndash; on valuation specifically, I think that I agree quite a bit with what Peter said. I think that Australia thinks about this a little bit from an equity lens and a real estate lens, and I&rsquo;ll throw in the credit lens. In valuation, there should be principles around good valuation. And by and large, third party, you either need some third-party independent evaluation agent coming in from time to time to evaluate those marks, or you need the benefit of having a third party having validated the price from time to time.</p>
<p>For us, almost everything that we do, especially on the credit side, we syndicate. We take some, we syndicate some, so there&rsquo;s some price checks and price validation, and then we use third parties to mark that to market along the way for things that are illiquid.</p>
<p>But I caution against &ndash; not in equities, but in credit, by and large, I caution against using marks or quotes as an indication of where you can move the entirety of a position. Because the liquidity structure of the fixed-income markets, at least in the US and in Europe, have changed quite significantly. I mean, it takes five days to move a bond without moving the price. 26% of investment-grade bonds in the US haven&rsquo;t been traded in the last month. So broker quotes aren&rsquo;t a really good, reliable source of where you can move a position on any given day.</p>
<p>But valuations, I&rsquo;ll go back to Raph&rsquo;s point again from the last panel, valuations actually are quite important in the private markets for a few reasons. One is, as an investor, you need to know your risk positions. Whether they&rsquo;re public or whether they&rsquo;re private, whether they&rsquo;re in your I-can-liquidate-or-not-liquidate bucket, you need to know from a portfolio perspective what your risk positions are.</p>
<p>Number two, very often managers earn fees on NAV. And so you take a look at like a private credit fund that&rsquo;s picking. OK, well, you&rsquo;re paid on pick, and if you never take a write-down for the company that&rsquo;s not picking, that&rsquo;s a good thing for the manager, not necessarily a great thing for the investor.</p>
<p>But the other thing that I&rsquo;ll mention that Peter said is, if you go all the way to the other end, which is for private equities, for instance, you&rsquo;re not looking to sell those on any given day. And so the big question in valuation is, you can have a third party come in and value those, but that&rsquo;s not the part of your portfolio you expect to sell and move on any given day. You&rsquo;re not liquidating them today. So you can look for some valuation framework, but then it&rsquo;s, what is the construct? Is it to move it today, or is it to move it over some reasonable period of time? And so I think if regulators give some general principles about valuation practices and constructs, it&rsquo;s actually quite &ndash; I would imagine that the industry leaders are already there, and most other firms would catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Jason, your ultimate boss, Larry Fink, he&rsquo;s sort of made no secret of trying to let a hell of a lot more sunshine into this area by using data, including from some of the sources that you mentioned earlier, to try and make private capital investments publicly tradable. Do you think you can crack this nut? And how much of it is about getting this valuation question right?</p>
<p><strong>Collins:</strong>&nbsp;So the holy grail would be to be able to index private markets and allow access to retail investors, mums and dads, more easily. Now that&rsquo;s a fair way off. The Preqin acquisition, Preqin does a couple of really interesting things. Firstly, it tracks 190,000 funds across 60,000 managers. It tracks performance data. It tracks the underlying portfolio companies within the funds, transactions there. And ideally what the benchmarks can do, firstly it helps clients track their own performance against the industry. But if you can find a way to create, and it could be tokenisation, it could be an ETF across private markets, that would be an incredible breakthrough.</p>
<p>I think Larry in his letter wrote, I don&rsquo;t really know how we&rsquo;re going to do that yet, but have faith in us, we managed to do this in ETFs, and that was a new technology which has really taken off. That&rsquo;s part of the reason that we did the Preqin acquisition, to try and bring benchmarking and transparency to the market. It&rsquo;s a really big task to collect that data, I think that&rsquo;s a big task ahead of ASIC if it wants to go down that path. But certainly we&rsquo;ve been having discussions with ASIC around that.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, Simone, clearly this issue of valuations is at the heart of so much of our private markets. We just had a couple of suggestions about regulatory guidelines rather than necessarily something prescriptive. How does that sound? That idea of setting some standards, I guess, that help bring the lower end of the market perhaps up to the industry leaders?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that valuations has been front and centre. A few really great thoughts, though, that come through tonight are reminders. One is it&rsquo;s about valuation in context, and different investors, it might be quite different, may approach valuation differently. For example, we&rsquo;ve heard tonight about illiquidity premium, also controlled premium.</p>
<p>I think the point about valuation in context is also important because when we&rsquo;re thinking about valuation by super funds, I can see a lot of my APRA colleagues here tonight who work and spend a lot of time on valuations when it comes to super funds, so there are some very developed standards in parts of the Australian market for valuations.</p>
<p>More broadly, though, absolutely where that&rsquo;s absent, guidance is appealing. So being very public in that statement; guidance is appealing. Guidance does seem like the right approach. I think guidance, though, only goes so far with valuations. You&rsquo;ve got to think, why can valuations be a problem? Well, it&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s paired with other problems, isn&rsquo;t it? So you&rsquo;ve got a liquidity problem, which has come out tonight, so what&rsquo;s disclosed about liquidity? You&rsquo;ve got a conflicts problem, for example, so there&rsquo;s a valuation that leads to unfair treatment of investors because there&rsquo;s conflicts of interest. So it&rsquo;s not just valuation for valuation&rsquo;s sake or transparency around that for its sake. So it&rsquo;s looking at the related issues.</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;s also not just about valuation per se and, say, doing it quarterly. Nor is it just about who does it. It&rsquo;s the basis of it and the disclosure. And what I mean by that is some may know there are practices that think about valuation on an as-developed basis. So you have a block of land today that might be worth X amount, but the valuation that&rsquo;s used and as part of the distribution of product is, oh, once it&rsquo;s developed and there&rsquo;s a piece added to it and this is done and that is done. Even if you think about valuation that way, you need to match that with some effective disclosure.</p>
<p>And I think that leads to the final point. Effective disclosure is only effective if we get some alignment or guidance on terms. There&rsquo;s some interesting terms used to support valuations and practices in different parts of the private markets and actually some terms should mean something when they&rsquo;re working their way into valuations and people investing or people borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;I thought you were going into the unrealised gains territory there for a moment. Peter, super funds have been under a lot of heat about valuations in the last &ndash; of unlisted assets in a little while. And my sense is that APRA has really asked the industry to pick up its game. Have you learnt anything from that process, or is there any learnings from that process that you would particularly point to that might be helpful as we think about the broader private market question?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Well, you&rsquo;re right. APRA has been really focused on that. So I think all super funds have now moved to quarterly. It begs the question whether there needs some adjustment; is quarterly even frequent enough? And where there&rsquo;s been substantial market moves in between quarters, what&rsquo;s the response to that? Where we&rsquo;re buying and selling units on a daily basis with our members. So I think that process.</p>
<p>Certainly the move to independent valuers, and regularly changing independent valuers, has been part of all that. But I still think we need a clearer definition about what we&rsquo;re valuing. What is the purpose of this valuation? What is this valuation actually supposed to mean? I think we had a few years ago a well-known private equity investment held by a number of superannuation funds, and each super fund had a wildly different valuation. That just brings into question the whole credibility of what we&rsquo;re talking about here when you&rsquo;ve got that situation arising. Now, each super fund was getting its own independent valuation, I&rsquo;m sure, but it still seems a bit strange when you get results which are so wildly different.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Matthew, lots of the big, Apollo I know a lot of its other peers in the US have been very intent on going down the investor scale from institutions down towards wealth management, for example, more towards the individual level. Does that bring up access when we&rsquo;re giving more individuals more access to private markets? I mean, in theory, it&rsquo;s a good thing that they get to balance their portfolios like the big guys do, but does it come with issues in your view?</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:&nbsp;</strong>It does. Look, as an overarching theme, it&rsquo;s a good thing to use the term democratise the access to private assets. Private assets, as we noted, used to just be risky; private equity, venture capital, hedge fund, and that was only really suitable, I&rsquo;ll use that word intentionally, for big institutions or high net worth clients with a diversified portfolio who were well advised and financially sophisticated.</p>
<p>As the definition of private markets has evolved massively over the last 10 years, you now have, again, investment grade product that used to sit on bank balance sheets that&rsquo;s now being originated by the likes of Apollo, the likes of BlackRock and others. And then you have stuff that&rsquo;s a little bit more yieldy, like direct lending, or what most of the headlines call private credit. And then you have things like infrastructure and you have things like real estate.</p>
<p>So the short answer is yes, it&rsquo;s a good thing. The question really comes down to is it appropriate for the investor base? If you look at the average person walking down the street that doesn&rsquo;t have financial advice, that doesn&rsquo;t think about the financial markets all day, that probably needs liquidity or access to liquidity more often than not, going into an ETF structure that&rsquo;s part public, part private, sounds like a really good solution for that. If you are somewhat advised, if you have somewhat of a portfolio, if you don&rsquo;t need daily liquidity, then doing something like direct lending or asset-backed credit or infrastructure could be appropriate.</p>
<p>And so in our minds, yes, it is good to give individuals access to private markets. Individuals globally are massively under-allocated private assets. They&rsquo;re just sitting in the concentrated stock markets and the concentrated bond markets. Giving them tools to diversify their own portfolios is a good thing, but one needs to really think about the suitability of the product for the cohort of the underlying investor.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Can I just ask you, you mentioned private credit there, Matt. Do we have a slightly rosy view of our private credit sector in Australia? I know when I talk to visiting Americans about what&rsquo;s happening in private credit in the US and other places, it&rsquo;s a very different industry. I mean, here it&rsquo;s sort of mainly property lending, isn&rsquo;t it? And whether we&rsquo;ve stuck a sort of cool badge on.</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:</strong>&nbsp;The short answer is private credit does mean something different in Australia than it does in the US, but it is converging. So private credit in the US, when you read the headlines, typically talks about direct lending. Our own personal view, our own firm view, is that we&rsquo;re not in a bubble in direct lending, but it is cyclical, and we are at the top of the cycle. That&rsquo;s both in the US and that&rsquo;s probably in Australia as well.</p>
<p>But if you talk about the private credit markets all together, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re talking about property lending. You&rsquo;re talking about asset-backed lending. You&rsquo;re talking about direct lending. In asset-backed lending, that could be mortgages, that could be autos, that could be credit cards.</p>
<p>I think what we have observed here, outside of the staples of direct lending and real estate lending, is you do have a private asset-backed market. And I think increasingly, the banks are starting to think about, I think the banks are starting to think about how can we partner with private capital to be balance sheet-like in some businesses and be more fee-driven, less balance sheet-driven, and how do we really put some of this balance sheet in private capital hands to price it on a market basis? So I think that that trend will evolve in Australia over the next couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got time for one question, if there&rsquo;s someone out there with a quick one. Simone, I want to ask you about the private credit question there. Do you worry that there&rsquo;s concentration of risk in private credit in property? Is that something we should be thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;We wouldn&rsquo;t say worry yet. We&rsquo;ve got to get the data together. We would say we worry we don&rsquo;t yet have the data to answer your question. And then if the data suggested that, which anecdotally it does, and by the way, the submissions did. I&rsquo;ve read all the submissions and this is something that comes through, then that is something we should pay attention to. The concentration to real estate, which seems to be a big part of the domestic private credit story, we do know in the past that&rsquo;s been, when there&rsquo;s been system shock, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s been. So that is one of the key reasons we need to get more transparency and more data to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Jason, I&rsquo;m going to do the Joe-Longo-for-a-day trick again. Five to 10 years, how do we make &ndash; what&rsquo;s a change you&rsquo;d like to see, could be market-led or regulatory-led, that would help private capital markets become more fair, efficient, resilient?</p>
<p><strong>Collins:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so in the next, I would take it out a bit further, five to 10 years, say 10 years, you&rsquo;ve got a wave of retirees that can come out of their super funds, and they&rsquo;ll need advice. And because they need advice, they will need access to private markets. And right now I&rsquo;m not sure the products that are being offered to the retail market, or even the wholesale market, evergreen funds for example, which was highlighted today by Ian Patrick from ART, are the right set up necessarily under the current needs of investors.</p>
<p>So there are some developments in the UK, with the FCA, with LTAF Funds. In Europe with, are they called, ELTIF funds I think they&rsquo;re called, and policy settings around these developments where you can mix private and public markets are pretty encouraging. Right now we don&rsquo;t have any evergreen structures. The longest we know we&rsquo;ve got is a month&rsquo;s redemption cycle, because we think there&rsquo;s a bit of a risk with the liquidity duration right now.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Matt, what would you like to change?</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:&nbsp;</strong>Well I&rsquo;m going to do one better than Guy, and I&rsquo;m not going to cop out, I&rsquo;m going to pander. I actually think the reason we took the time to write the report that we did was it is rare for a regulator to say, to accept the private markets as something that&rsquo;s not going away. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s here, it&rsquo;s something that is, that can be a good thing. And the acceptance of, with the right engagement, and the right regulatory approach, without it being a witch hunt, that they can create a very robust access mechanism for private assets, as well as a robust investment ecosystem here in Australia.</p>
<p>I think as you go across the world that isn&rsquo;t the case. Most reports you read on private credit or private assets is, it&rsquo;s systemic risk, it&rsquo;s going to take the world down, it&rsquo;s going to take the banks down, it&rsquo;s going to take our country down, it&rsquo;s going to do this. Here, here it&rsquo;s been, we accept private assets are here to stay. How can we have Australia most productively engage with them? So I think this type of engagement will lead to good outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>We call that sucking up in Australia. Peter, you&rsquo;ve raised some really good points about valuation. Is there anything else you&rsquo;d sort of call out in the next 10 years that we could do?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Well, in addition to valuation, I think collecting and publishing data on a system-wide basis, would actually give us all a lot more confidence in exactly what the private markets are and the size of them, the depth of them, and the processes that use them. So I commend ASIC in endeavouring to collect more data.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to remember one of the big triggers for the GFC was the mortgage lending market in the US, and that was all done on a state basis and no one collected the data. So the Fed didn&rsquo;t actually know how big this thing was until it actually blew up. So I think we&rsquo;d all be better off with knowing more data and understanding whether there are system risks or not system risks there, to manage the whole process better. But liquidity, valuations and transparency are the three.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Simone, you&rsquo;ve obviously been working towards this paper over the last quarter of the year. But can you give us a sense of some of the priorities that have come out of this view? Valuations, transparency, understanding the size of the sector better. Are they the top three, or is there a few you&rsquo;d add?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;So, I think that&rsquo;s the polite way of not asking me what I do.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, well, if you&rsquo;re going to tell us, please go for it.</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;So the focus is, I think focus areas for us have come through tonight. Continuing to look at wherever ASIC, within ASIC&rsquo;s gift there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s getting in the way of entities being able to see through growth in a listed market. That really comes through in the submissions. So if there are ways that ASIC can make it more viable to be medium to long term focused as a company, so that&rsquo;s on the public market side.</p>
<p>On the private market side, the convergence theme that&rsquo;s coming through we consider pretty important, in the sense that it&rsquo;s not just about the getting companies on the board. It&rsquo;s not just about the companies. It&rsquo;s also about that access and participation. So we need to ensure there&rsquo;s the opportunity to participate. Australia is a nation of investors, like a world-leading nation of investors, not just through your super funds. We need to preserve that participation. So areas that can bring that forward are actually data and transparency.</p>
<p>So the data and transparency side, yes, it&rsquo;s really important from the system side, but it&rsquo;s also important for that convergence and opening up private markets to individuals. And something really exciting in the submissions we received are entities like BlackRock and some of the other big internationals thinking how can we give that information and use transparency in that way?</p>
<p>Finally, on the downside, it&rsquo;s probably come through in the remarks tonight. We will be accelerating our work on private credit. We are accelerating our work on private credit. And as I said, credit to many in the industry who brought that forth in their own submissions. Private credit, as we keep saying, private credit is good for the economy and access. We&rsquo;re about the economy and the financial system. It is good for the economy, for investors and borrowers, if done well. We need to first consider is it done well, where it&rsquo;s not, shine a light on that, and dimension what that done well looks like. And that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll be accelerating.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, Simone. It&rsquo;s a great outlook, we&rsquo;ll look forward to what we&rsquo;re going to get towards the end of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please thank Simone, Jason, and Peter.</p>

<title>ASIC Cracks Down On Unlawful Finfluencers In Global Push Against Misconduct</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has issued warning notices to 18 social media &lsquo;finfluencers&rsquo; suspected of unlawfully promoting high-risk financial products and providing unlicensed financial advice to Australians as part of a Global Week of Action Against Unlawful Finfluencers by nine international market regulators.</p>
<p>Last week, ASIC and regulators from the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Hong Kong and Canada took coordinated actions to crack down on unauthorised finfluencers.</p>
<p>Together, the nine regulators used a combination of regulatory and enforcement powers including arrests, warning notices, website takedowns, educational schemes with authorised finfluencers and consumer awareness programs to put unauthorised finfluencers on notice and warn consumers of the risks of unauthorised and misleading finfluencer content.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, &lsquo;Regulators across the world have joined forces to disrupt unlawful finfluencer activity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s important that consumers separate fun from fact when it comes to finfluencer content. Popularity doesn't equal credibility. Check their credentials and whether they&rsquo;re licensed or authorised, before checking your money out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following the issuance of INFO Sheet 269&nbsp;<em>Discussing financial products and services online</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/discussing-financial-products-and-services-online/" title="Discussing financial products and services online">INFO 269</a>) in 2022, ASIC has observed a noticeable drop in social media posts spruiking financial products and services by unauthorised finfluencers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Australia, after ASIC issued INFO 269, we saw that many finfluencers changed what they were saying or became licensed or authorised representatives to comply with the law,&rsquo; Mr Kirkland added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australian Financial Services licensees who engage influencers also improved their due diligence and monitoring of finfluencers to ensure they don&rsquo;t provide unlicensed financial services and that consumers are not misled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s current concerns lie with finfluencers positioning themselves as so-called trading experts, who are providing unauthorised financial product advice and promoting high-risk, complex investment products that can cause real consumer harm, such as contracts for difference (CFDs) and over the counter (OTC) derivative products.</p>
<p>Their social media content is often accompanied by misleading or deceptive representations about the prospects of success from the products or trading strategies they promote, sharing images of lavish lifestyles, sportscars and other luxury goods.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are seeing a pattern where these unlicensed finfluencers invite consumers to join their closed communities or forums to learn their secrets to success or copy their trades,&rsquo; Mr Kirkland said.</p>
<p>If a finfluencer is not licensed, an authorised representative or exempt, they&rsquo;re legally not permitted to carry on a business of providing investment advice in Australia.</p>
<p>Investors and consumers can check the credentials of finfluencers out by using&nbsp;<a href="https://service.asic.gov.au/search/">ASIC&rsquo;s professional registers search</a>&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>Recent Moneysmart research found that 41% of young Australians seek financial information or advice from online sources such as social media, including finfluencers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s financial services laws protect investors and promote market integrity. They set minimum requirements and provide important protections for investors if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you spruik or discuss financial products and services online, you need to carefully consider how the law applies to you and seek legal advice if you are unsure,&rsquo; Mr Kirkland said.</p>
<p>ASIC conducts targeted monitoring of financial discussion by finfluencers that feature or promote financial products. Where we see harm occurring, we will take action to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Unlicensed activity can be reported to ASIC on our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/contact-us/reporting-misconduct-to-asic/" title="Reporting misconduct to ASIC">How to report misconduct</a>&nbsp;webpage or by calling 1300 300 630 so that we can consider appropriate regulatory action.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In addition to ASIC, the nine regulators involved in the Global Week of Action Against Unlawful Finfluencers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canada, Alberta Securities Commission</li>
<li>Canada, Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers, Quebec,</li>
<li>Canada, British Columbia Securities Commission</li>
<li>Canada, Ontario Securities Commission</li>
<li>Hong Kong, Securities and Futures Commission</li>
<li>Italy, Commissione Nazionale per le Societ&agrave; e la Borsa</li>
<li>United Arab Emirates, Securities and Commodities Authority</li>
<li>United Kingdom, Financial Conduct Authority</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC issued&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/discussing-financial-products-and-services-online/" title="Discussing financial products and services online">INFO 269</a>&nbsp;in March 2022 for social media influencers who discuss financial products and services online.</p>
<p>The licensing provisions under the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act) apply to persons who carry on a financial services business in Australia. This includes persons who provide financial product advice or arrange for a person to deal in a financial product. Carrying on an unlicensed financial services business in Australia is an offence under the Act, unless authorised as a representative of a licensee or relying on an exemption.</p>
<p>The Act imposes significant penalties, including up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment for an individual and financial penalties into the millions of dollars for a corporation.</p>
<p>The law also prohibits conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or is likely to mislead or deceive, in relation to financial products or services. A finfluencer does not need to be licensed to breach the misleading or deceptive prohibitions.</p>
<p>In December 2022, the Federal Court found social media finfluencer Tyson Robert Scholz contravened s911A of the Corporations Act by carrying on a financial service business (between March 2020 and November 2021) without an Australian financial services licence (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-371mr-federal-court-makes-findings-against-social-media-finfluencer-tyson-scholz/" title="22-371MR Federal Court makes findings against social media &lsquo;finfluencer&rsquo; Tyson Scholz">22-371MR</a>).</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson On The Extension Of Compliance Date For Form PF</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission voted to extend the effective compliance date for relevant registrants to comply with the revised Form PF. The Joint Final Rule by the Commissions was adopted over a year ago on February 8, 2024. As Securities Exchange Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw noted in her statement during the SEC&rsquo;s public meeting today, registrants have had a significant window of time to prepare for tomorrow&rsquo;s compliance deadline. The issues raised indicate potential technology-based concerns as well as challenges with validation, testing, and ensuring effective capabilities for timely and accurate reporting of requested information. These issues should have been fully addressed prior to today. In the least, the issues should have been presented to the Commissions before the eleventh hour to enable proper investigation and resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>Notwithstanding grave concerns, I have moved the request for an extension. In part, my decision is intended to demonstrate the strength and value of bi-partisan Commissions as well as our ability to reach the best outcomes for our markets, our economy and our nation. I am hopeful that the Commissions leadership&rsquo; commitments to democratic processes continue to prevail and our regulation continues to protect investors, encourage market integrity and stability, and foster and promote the deepest, most liquid markets in the world.</span></p>

<title>Statement On The Extension Of The Compliance Date For The Amendments To Form PF, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins and thank you to the staffs of both the SEC and the CFTC for your work.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s extension gives affected persons additional time to comply with the requirements associated with the new amendments to Form PF.&nbsp; I appreciate the comment letters that have expressed concerns with the technical aspects of complying with revised Form PF that have helped inform this extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In addition to giving time to market participants and the Commissions to address these technical issues, the delay gives flexibility to address other unforeseen concerns with respect to revised Form PF.&nbsp; This approach will mitigate the potential for an outcome where uncertainty, confusion, and ambiguity in technical requirements results in firms spending significant amounts of money to file reports with data that is useless, inconsistent, and not of any value to the SEC or other government agencies that rely on such reports. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action is necessary to address significant shortcomings with the 2024 amendments to Form PF.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; The rulemaking ran afoul of what &ldquo;good regulation&rdquo; looks like, in that it failed to answer a fundamental question: do the economic and information benefits yield results that are commensurate with the compliance burdens to the firms?&nbsp; When the burdens outweigh the benefits&mdash;such as where the provisions are both costly and likely ineffective&mdash;this represents the worst rulemaking outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, commenters expressed concern about disaggregating each component fund of a master-feeder arrangement and parallel fund structure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; One commenter explained that disaggregated information would be &ldquo;misleading and difficult to analyze,&rdquo; and that it is &ldquo;not the type of information that the Commissions likely would be able to readily and accurately re-aggregate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissions&rsquo; response was simply to &ldquo;disagree&rdquo; that the information would be misleading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As firms have tried to implement what the Commissions required, the technical shortcomings with these and other requirements have become more apparent.</p>
<p>In moving forward, it is important to balance the sensitivity of the data included in Form PF with any corresponding benefits.&nbsp; The costs associated with this data are significant&mdash;both in terms of compliance costs and demands on firm personnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to the SEC staff in the Division of Investment Management, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Office of the General Counsel for your work on this matter to date.</p>

<title>Extensions On Extensions: Statement On Further Extension Of The Form PF Compliance Date, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&rsquo;s open meeting looks like a straightforward Commission vote to extend a compliance date for a recently adopted rulemaking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;But there is more here than meets the eye. The reality of our action today is more complex &ndash; and more concerning. And the clock is ticking because the compliance date at issue is, in fact,&nbsp;<i>tomorrow</i>.</p>
<p>Form PF is the confidential form on which certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds report information to the SEC that helps us to understand potential systemic risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC, and other regulators including FSOC, depend on these detailed data to better comprehend when the private markets may be experiencing turbulence that could affect our entire financial system. Because these entities generally operate outside of our regulatory view, these data are our best &ndash; and perhaps only &ndash; way to spot large scale financial disasters originating in the private funds market, or amplified by private fund exposure, before they happen. And, these data can help us understand more fully the impact of a market event if it has already occurred.</p>
<p>The recent amendments, and the &ldquo;new&rdquo; version of the form they create, would improve the quality of these data so that they are more precise and helpful for identifying and responding to systemic risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Remember, many of our pension fund dollars are invested in private funds &ndash; so understanding risks in this market is important for American retirement savings.</p>
<p>Today, the Commission is attempting to extend the new form&rsquo;s compliance date under the wire, with just hours to spare, to accommodate a last-minute request<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;from some of the most highly sophisticated, highly resourced entities in our financial system, who have already been given an extension several months ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Now they&rsquo;re back for more time with what doesn&rsquo;t seem like a credible reason.</p>
<p>The truth is that we are here to extend this compliance date not because firms actually need additional time to comply, but to allow for reconsideration of these amendments more broadly. If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll find the proof in footnote 12 of today&rsquo;s release. That footnote admits that the Commission is delaying the Form&rsquo;s compliance date so it can revisit &ndash; or perhaps endeavor to abandon &ndash; this information altogether.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;So, although this extension is for just a few more months, I suspect that we will continue to accommodate requests to extend this compliance date until we have significantly revised or undone this rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<h2>Abandoning the APA</h2>
<p>And so, with this vote, we plough ahead and do exactly that. We are simply disregarding the authority of&nbsp;<i>two</i>&nbsp;previous Commissions &ndash; at both the SEC and the CFTC &ndash; who adopted this new form just one year ago. And while I would posit that entities in such a situation should abide by regulations lawfully adopted and thus file the new form, this procedural quagmire is certainly a far cry from what the APA intends.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Much has been said about the Commission&rsquo;s desire to &ldquo;return&rdquo; to a reasoned agency process,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;but this desire is nowhere to be found when there&rsquo;s a looming compliance date that some would like to dodge.</p>
<h2>Less Information, But More Retail Access</h2>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that this timing also just so happens to be aligned with a powerful policy push to increasingly open private markets to retail investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;By preventing these amendments from coming online, we are willfully blindfolding the Commission and similarly hobbling our and other financial regulators&rsquo; ability to conduct more precise and effective analysis of private markets. This further undermines our ability to do data-driven rulemaking in the future,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;including our ability to effectively do an economic analysis if this or any future Commission tries to open private markets to retail investors. And the timing couldn&rsquo;t be worse, as evidenced by increasingly widespread concern about the stability of private markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Refusing to receive these improved data on systemic risk doesn&rsquo;t make those risks go away. And we can&rsquo;t have it both ways. We can&rsquo;t suggest that its perfectly safe and appropriate for investors of all stripes to gain exposure to these markets while we are going out of our way to put our head in the sand about what&rsquo;s actually going on in those same markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, if this Commission wants to revisit Form PF and reconsider any part of the Form, it can attempt to do so as part of the rulemaking process and in proper coordination with the CFTC. Not by forcing through an eleventh-hour compliance date extension under false pretenses.</p>
<p>Thank you to the staff in the Division of Investment Management, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for their work on this release. I&rsquo;m particularly grateful to many of these team members who also worked on the final form amendments last year. I hope that, one day, the Commission will actually experience the benefits of your work and the important data from these Form PF amendments.</p>

<title>Statement At Open Meeting On Further Extension Of The Form PF Compliance Date, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-at-open-meeting-on-further-extension-of-the-form-pf-compliance-date-p-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here. This is an open meeting on the 11th of June 2025 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Government in the Sunshine Act. Commissioners Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, and Mark Uyeda are also present.</p>
<p>Today the Commission will vote on extending the compliance date for the most recent amendments to Form PF. Currently, the compliance date for these amendments is tomorrow, June 12, 2025, but I support extending the compliance date to October 1, 2025. The initial compliance date for these amendments was March 12, 2025. In January, the SEC and CFTC jointly extended the compliance date to June 12, 2025. Notwithstanding the prior three-month compliance extension, we have received credible commentary that the current timeline simply does not provide private fund advisers with sufficient opportunity to interpret, implement, and test their systems to ensure accurate and consistent reporting. From my experience with complex technology projects, I sympathize with those points. It is evident to me that additional time is required for dialogue with filers, review of the reasonableness of the data demands, and review of the actual utility of the information collected.</p>
<p>The most-recent changes to Form PF will necessitate costly upgrades to internal infrastructure, increased coordination across business units, and integration with third-party vendors. These tasks are inherently complex and require extensive testing to ensure accuracy. Rushing this process increases the likelihood of data errors, which defeats the entire stated purpose of the form&mdash;to enhance systemic risk monitoring.</p>
<p>Form PF was first introduced in 2011 and has subsequently been amended three times, most recently in February 2024. Each time the form has been amended, it has required advisers to provide additional information and more granular data. As a result, even without the most recent amendments, Form PF imposes significant compliance burdens on the private fund industry. The complexity of the form, in addition to the ever-evolving nature of its demands has required advisers to seek costly legal and compliance support to complete it accurately. These costs divert resources away from advisers&rsquo; core investment functions.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to our action today, I have directed the staff to undertake a comprehensive review of Form PF. I have serious concerns whether the government&rsquo;s use of this data justifies the massive burdens it imposes. We should work hard to keep our information requests to a minimum, requesting only what is needed and no more. As the saying goes, &ldquo;Measure twice, cut once.&rdquo; While this important work is being done, private fund advisers will continue to provide a wealth of information on the prior version of Form PF.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC for their agility in responding to these concerns.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll turn the meeting over to Natasha Greiner, Director of the Division of Investment Management, for the staff&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Statement Before The Appropriations Subcommittee On Financial Services And General Government</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessents-statement-before-the-appropriations-subcom-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessents-statement-before-the-appropriations-subcom-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chair Hagerty, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the subcommittee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today. Treasury is committed to working with Congress to improve our nation&rsquo;s finances, create new jobs, and strengthen the economy. The President&rsquo;s Budget request for Treasury demonstrates our commitment to boosting growth, promoting efficiency within our agency, and targeting illicit actors that threaten our national security. We look forward to coordinating with you on the President&rsquo;s Budget and his tax priorities in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this effort, I wish to highlight today the Treasury Department&rsquo;s efforts to advance President Trump&rsquo;s economic agenda on tax and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Treasury has just completed its most successful tax filing season in years&mdash;and we did so while improving efficiencies and cutting costs at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics of the President&rsquo;s efforts to modernize the IRS warned that the effort would result in a 10% shortfall in receipts. Instead, the opposite happened. April receipts this year were up 9.5% over the previous year. And receipts in May were up 14.7% over the previous year. Most remarkably, the President was able to achieve these results while reducing $2 billion in waste and planned IT spending at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This success has taken place against the backdrop of one of the most consequential tax proposals ever to come before Congress: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and businesses with certainty and build economic momentum. The legislation is squarely aimed at boosting the working and middle class and reinvigorating American manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the One Big Beautiful Bill will raise take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the average worker. And it will cement no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and tax cuts for seniors.</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill will also incentivize unprecedented investment in US manufacturing. The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made-in-America. And it will streamline burdensome permitting processes that often stand in the way of new manufacturing projects. It&rsquo;s time for this country to start building things again&mdash;and the One Big Beautiful Bill makes this possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is grateful for the House&rsquo;s efforts to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill. We now look forward to working closely with this subcommittee and other members of the Senate to get this legislation to the President&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade is the second topic I wish to highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progress we have made on tax issues over the last four months complements the significant progress we have made in rebalancing the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I last testified before Congress in May, the President announced the historic US-UK trade deal. This arrangement&mdash;which creates a $5 billion export opportunity for American ranchers, farmers, and manufacturers&mdash;is a preview of what&rsquo;s to come. Dozens of countries have engaged the administration thus far with offers to improve their trade relations with the United States. This includes China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just returned from successful negotiations in London with the Chinese delegation. I am confident these negotiations will bring balance to the economic relationship between our two countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has a singular opportunity to stabilize its economy by shifting away from excess production towards greater consumption. But the country needs to be a reliable partner in trade negotiations. If China will course-correct by upholding its end of the initial trade agreement we outlined in Geneva&mdash;and I believe after our talks in London they will&mdash;then a rebalancing of the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By challenging the decades-old status quo on tax and trade, President Trump is breathing new life into the American economy. More than&nbsp;500,000 private-sector payroll&nbsp;jobs have been added since January. Most importantly, inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy. After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration&rsquo;s policies. Furthermore, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and plentiful labor demand as job openings remain high. This strength has been exemplified in the recent performance of the stock market and consumer confidence data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s bold leadership on these issues has laid the foundation for a Golden Age economy. With your help, we can build on that foundation to create even greater prosperity and abundance for the American people. We hope you will join us in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Problem Form: Statement On Further Extension Of Compliance Date For Form PF, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, June 11, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Natasha [Greiner] and Oliver [Richard]. I support extending the compliance date for the February 8, 2024 amendments to Form PF<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;to October 1, 2025.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Extending the compliance date until then will give filers and their third-party service providers additional time to develop and test their reporting systems. As the request letter noted, &ldquo;private fund advisers subject to the rule [need] additional time to build and test the new reporting systems and work through any outstanding reporting and interpretive questions with the goal of providing uniform data to the Commissions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The new form is not ready for prime time. The extension reflects a commitment to good governance and common-sense implementation.</p>
<p>Although I support an extension, my concerns about Form PF and its recent expansions persist. We should reassess whether the information the form collects aligns with the intended purpose of the form. As I noted in my dissent to the adoption of the amendments we are extending, &ldquo;unbridled curiosity rather than . . . a legitimate regulatory objective&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;shapes the demands of Form PF. Overly extensive reporting requirements not only are unduly costly and invasive, but erroneously suggest that the government&rsquo;s role with respect to private funds is akin to its role supervising banks, which have a government backstop. I support the Chairman&rsquo;s directive to review Form PF to determine whether it serves its intended systemic risk mitigation purpose.</p>
<p>I want to thank the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC staff in the Divisions of Investment Management and Economic and Risk Analysis and Office of General Counsel for their quick work in drafting the extension release. Let me close with a word of thanks to Natasha Greiner, who has served the Commission so well for almost a quarter of a century, culminating with her role as Director of the Division of Investment Management.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Thank you, Natasha, and we wish you the best as you leave the agency. Your willingness to pitch in and help wherever you could will continue to serve as a model for the rest of us. You will be missed.</p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders Michigan Man, California Man, And Two Nevada Companies To Pay Over $25 Million For Digital Asset Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-federal-court-orders-michigan-man-california-man-and-two-nevada-companie-2025611/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-federal-court-orders-michigan-man-california-man-and-two-nevada-companie-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final default judgement against&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Mark Gillespie</strong></span><span>&nbsp;of Michigan,&nbsp;</span><span><strong>John Roche</strong></span><span>&nbsp;of California,</span><span>&nbsp;<strong>My Big Coin Pay, Inc.</strong></span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span><strong>My Big Coin, Inc.</strong></span><span>, both of Nevada.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The order requires Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., and Roche to pay, jointly and severally a $19,326,324 civil monetary penalty and $6,442,108 in restitution to defrauded victims in connection with their role in a digital asset fraud scheme. The order also imposes a permanent injunction against the defendants and bans them from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets; entering into any transactions involving commodity interests or digital asset commodities; and registering with the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span><strong>Case Background</strong></span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The default order finds from at least January 2014 through June 2017, Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., and Roche, together with co-defendant&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Randall Crater</strong></span><span>, one of the other co-defendants named in the CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint, operated a digital asset scheme in which they fraudulently offered the sale of a fully-functioning virtual currency, My Big Coin (MBC), a commodity in interstate commerce. The CFTC dismissed its enforcement action against named co-defendant&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Michael Kruger</strong></span><span>&nbsp;because of his death.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The defendants obtained more than $6 million from at least 28 customers through fraudulent solicitations, including false and misleading claims and omissions about MBC&rsquo;s value, usage, and trade status, and that MBC was backed by gold. Crater misappropriated virtually all the money solicited from customers, using those misappropriated funds wrongfully.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The order resolves the claims against Gillespie, Roche, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., and My Big Coin, Inc., in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action. [See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7678-18">7678-18</a><span>] The court had previously entered a consent order resolving the CFTC&rsquo;s claims against Crater, who is currently imprisoned for his role in the scheme. [See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9051-25">9051-25</a><span>]</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>On January 18, 2022, a grand jury returned an eight-count superseding indictment charging Crater with wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business based on the same conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint. [United States v. Randall Crater, No. 1:19-cr-10063-DJC (D. Mass. Jan. 18, 2022)).] Crater was found guilty of those charges on July 21, 2022, and was sentenced to 100 months in prison and ordered to pay $7,668,317.50 in restitution to defrauded customers and to forfeit $7,668,317.50, which represented the proceeds he received from his violations.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the FBI.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Daniel Ullman II, Chrystal Gonnella, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Paul G. Hayeck, and former Division staff members Jonah E. McCarthy, Jason Mahoney, John Einstman, Hillary Van Tassel, Patricia Gomersall, and Kyong J. Koh.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;SIFMA strongly supports the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) amending its Rule G-14 to revert to 15-minute trade reporting.&nbsp; The fixed income markets&mdash;including the municipal securities market&mdash;remain predominantly over-the-counter, where elements of trading and post-execution processing rely on manual processes, or are subject to still developing and non-comprehensive automation.&nbsp; An across-the-board one-minute reporting requirement is not feasible due to the lack of full post-trade automation stemming from the importance of bilateral negotiation in many fixed income markets.&nbsp; We are also pleased to see the MSRB remove the manual trade flag and the two exceptions which were part of the recent revisions to the Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Killian, managing director, securitization and corporate credit, on FINRA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rule-filings/sr-finra-2025-008">proposed rule change</a>&nbsp;to amend Rule 6730:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA strongly supports FINRA amending its Rule 6730 to revert to 15-minute trade reporting, as this trade reporting framework appropriately balances the need for market transparency with the operational realities of the over-the-counter (OTC) fixed income markets. Unlike the centralized and highly automated equity markets, the fixed income markets depend heavily on manual or partially automated processes, including phone calls and chat-based communications. For many firms, particularly smaller ones, achieving one-minute reporting is either technologically unfeasible or financially burdensome.&nbsp; SIFMA also commends FINRA for removing the manual trade flag and the two exceptions previously introduced under the revised rule. These changes recognize the unique structure and functioning of the fixed income markets while maintaining the integrity and timeliness of market data. We will review the aspect of the proposal regarding reporting of allocation trades and provide comments to FINRA, but as an initial matter, are pleased to see FINRA&rsquo;s attention to this issue which has long burdened dual-registered firms.&nbsp; SIFMA remains committed to working with FINRA and other stakeholders to ensure a transparent, efficient, and resilient fixed income marketplace.&rdquo;</p>

<title>FIA: Adoption Of Tokenisation Beneficial For Cleared Derivatives Industry - FIA Sees Collateral Mobility As Important Use Case For Blockchain Technology</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fia-adoption-of-tokenisation-beneficial-for-cleared-derivatives-industry-fia-2025611/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fia-adoption-of-tokenisation-beneficial-for-cleared-derivatives-industry-fia-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FIA released a white paper on the potential application of tokenisation to accelerate the mobility of collateral in the cleared derivatives industry. &nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US"><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12KWwDjQ1Vxi2FPfAzEs0UpFE9zpHh">Read the paper</a><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12KWwDNuBZpZr2yS24s864oH4XSdua">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">The paper states that the cleared derivatives industry is at an "inflection point" in the adoption of tokenisation and notes that several clearinghouses are exploring use cases for this technology. It describes the potential benefits and&nbsp;some of the challenges for adoption at scale and concludes with four recommendations.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">&ldquo;Over the last several years, we have seen a growing recognition among our members that tokenisation could have a practical use case in how we manage the movement of collateral,&rdquo; said FIA president and CEO Walt Lukken. "By creating a digital representation of an asset on a distributed ledger, tokenisation can allow us to move collateral in close to real time. That can unlock liquidity and reduce risks and costs associated with traditional settlement processes."&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">The paper calls attention to four main benefits of tokenisation:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><ol start="1">
<li> It would increase the speed of asset transfers, especially for non-cash collateral, by cutting the settlement time from days to minutes.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li> It would allow for extended trading hours, including the potential for 24/7 trading, by decoupling the settlement system from the operational hours of traditional banking system payment rails.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="3">
<li> Using distributed ledger technology would reduce the errors that arise when each entity keeps its own record of the transaction on its own system and the inefficiencies that arise from the duplication of processes across financial institutions.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="4">
<li> It could help automate certain functions with "smart contracts," whereby code attached to the tokenised asset fulfils certain actions when specified conditions are met.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div>
<p>"Years of work on this technology are starting to bear fruit," said Will Acworth, global head of market intelligence. "We are seeing scepticism give way to genuine interest as firms see real-world benefits in terms of operational efficiency and real-time risk management. Although there are many issues that will need addressing before it can be deployed at scale, we think the time has come for both the industry and its regulators to recognize the benefits of technology and work together on adoption." &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">The paper outlines four recommendations:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><ol start="1">
<li> The importance of education, and how FIA can play a supporting role by connecting experts in blockchain technology with the operations, risk, funding, compliance, legal and other professionals who manage the movement of collateral in today&rsquo;s technology systems.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li> Legal certainty will speed adoption. FIA has analysed the US regulatory landscape but more work is required across the globe to clarify whether existing rules permit tokenised assets for use as collateral.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="3">
<li> Adoption of this new technology should start with forms of collateral that meet existing regulatory standards for liquidity, such as certain government bonds and money market funds.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="4">
<li> Strong collaboration and industry standards will increase adoption. The movement of collateral involves many segments of the cleared derivatives ecosystem, including clearinghouses, clearing brokers, custodians, market participants, traditional technology providers and the next generation of blockchain network providers. One way to encourage adoption across this ecosystem is through pilot projects, tabletop exercises and other forms of collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Statement Before The House Ways And Means Committee</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Neal, and members of the committee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today. Treasury is committed to working with Congress to improve our nation&rsquo;s finances, create new jobs, and strengthen the economy. We look forward to coordinating with you on the President&rsquo;s Budget and his tax priorities in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of this effort, I wish to highlight today the Treasury Department&rsquo;s efforts to advance President Trump&rsquo;s economic agenda on tax and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Treasury has just completed its most successful tax filing season in years&mdash;and we did so while improving efficiencies and cutting costs at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics of the President&rsquo;s efforts to modernize the IRS warned that the effort would result in a 10% shortfall in receipts. Instead, the opposite happened. April receipts this year were up 9.5% over the previous year. And receipts in May were up 14.7% over the previous year. Most remarkably, the President was able to achieve these results while reducing $2 billion in waste and planned IT spending at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This success has taken place against the backdrop of one of the most consequential tax proposals ever to come before Congress: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and businesses with certainty and build economic momentum. The legislation is squarely aimed at boosting the working and middle class and reinvigorating American manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the One Big Beautiful Bill will raise take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the average worker. And it will cement no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and tax cuts for seniors.</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill will also incentivize unprecedented investment in US manufacturing. The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made-in-America. And it will streamline burdensome permitting processes that often stand in the way of new manufacturing projects. It&rsquo;s time for this country to start building things again&mdash;and the One Big Beautiful Bill makes this possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is grateful for the leadership of this committee in shepherding the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House. We are now working closely with members of the Senate to get this legislation to the President&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade is the second topic I wish to highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progress we have made on tax issues over the last four months complements the significant progress we have made in rebalancing the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I last testified before Congress in May, the President announced the historic US-UK trade deal. This arrangement&mdash;which creates a $5 billion export opportunity for American ranchers, farmers, and manufacturers&mdash;is a preview of what&rsquo;s to come. Dozens of countries have engaged the administration thus far with offers to improve their trade relations with the United States. This includes China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has a singular opportunity to stabilize its economy by shifting away from excess production towards greater consumption. But the country needs to be a reliable partner in trade negotiations. If China will course-correct by upholding its end of the initial trade agreement we outlined in Geneva last month, then a big, beautiful rebalancing of the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By challenging the decades-old status quo on tax and trade, President Trump is breathing new life into the American economy. More than&nbsp;500,000 private-sector payroll&nbsp;jobs have been added since January. Most importantly, inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy. After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration&rsquo;s policies. Furthermore, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and plentiful labor demand as job openings remain high. This strength has been exemplified in the recent performance of the stock market and consumer confidence data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s bold leadership on these issues has laid the foundation for a Golden Age economy. With your help, we can build on that foundation to create even greater prosperity and abundance for the American people. We hope you will join us in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>PIABA Praises SEC Investor Advisory Committee For Tackling Forced Arbitration By RIAs — But Urges Stronger Action</title>

<p class="s6"><span><span><span><span>The Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (PIABA) offered measured praise for the SEC Investor Advisory Committee for its new recommendations related to Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) arbitration. PIABA, a long-time critic of forced arbitration, welcomed the move as an important first step, but emphasized that the SEC has a lot more work to do to protect main street investors.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>&ldquo;PIABA joins with the financial industry in calling for more fairness and consistency,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><span>said Adam Gana<strong>&nbsp;</strong>president of PIABA and managing partner of Gana Weinstein LLP.&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Mandatory arbitration, as it stands today, often locks investors out of meaningful justice.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its inaugural collaboration with Hilton Capital Management LLC, culminating in the launch of the Solactive Hilton Capital BDC Corporate Bond TR Index. This first-of-its-kind index offers targeted exposure to fixed-income securities issued by U.S.-registered Business Development Companies (BDCs), aiming to provide investors with access to elevated yields within a regulated, investment-grade framework.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As investor interest in private credit continues to rise, BDC bonds present a compelling opportunity. These instruments consistently yield above average Baa-rated corporates<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hilton-capital-management-launches-hilton-bdc-corporate-bond-etf-tracking-solactive-hilton-capital-bdc-corporate-bond-tr-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>, delivering attractive income potential while generally maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. Furthermore, U.S. regulations require BDCs to maintain asset coverage of at least 150%, safeguarding bondholders by constraining leverage and ensuring structural risk discipline. Notably, BDCs boast a flawless repayment track record across more than 25 years of public &ldquo;baby bond&rdquo; issuance<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hilton-capital-management-launches-hilton-bdc-corporate-bond-etf-tracking-solactive-hilton-capital-bdc-corporate-bond-tr-index/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hilton-capital-management-launches-hilton-bdc-corporate-bond-etf-tracking-solactive-hilton-capital-bdc-corporate-bond-tr-index/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span>, underlining their stability and reliability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FH00">Solactive Hilton Capital BDC Corporate Bond TR Index</a>&nbsp;methodology leverages this stability and upside by focusing exclusively on fixed-coupon bonds issued by BDCs listed in the annual Business Development Company Report published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). To ensure liquidity and quality, eligible bonds must have a minimum outstanding amount of USD 250 million and be priced by a designated price provider. Securities such as floating-rate notes, convertibles, inflation-linked, municipal, structured, or perpetual bonds are excluded. To avoid over-concentration, the index imposes a 10% cap per issuer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hilton BDC Corporate Bond ETF is listed on June 11<span>th</span>, 2025, on the Nasdaq with the ticker HBDC.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are thrilled to launch our first joint index with Hilton Capital Management, marking a new chapter in our collaboration. By translating the distinct income characteristics and regulatory structure of BDC bonds into a transparent, rules-based index, we aim to provide investors with a new tool for gaining exposure to the BDC bond universe. Furthermore, it enables access to the dynamics of the private-credit market through a well-regulated and transparent structure.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alex Oxenham, Chief Investment Officer at Hilton Capital Management, commented:&nbsp;</span><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to partner with Solactive on the Solactive Hilton Capital BDC Corporate Bond TR Index, a first-of-its-kind benchmark that passively seeks to unlock the yield premium of senior unsecured BDC bonds within a transparent, rules-based framework. By enforcing strict eligibility filters&mdash;$250 million minimum issue size, 10% issuer caps, and quarterly rebalancing&mdash;we&rsquo;ve created an ETF-ready vehicle offering daily liquidity and broad diversification across leading BDC issuers. This collaboration transforms an overlooked corner of the credit market into a scalable solution for insurers, pension funds, and income-focused investors seeking private credit exposure.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<title>Opening Remarks By Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets &amp; Development), Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI-ILSTC) Trade And Financial Conference On 11 June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information and Health, Mr Tan Kiat How,<br /><br />Chongqing Municipal People&rsquo;s Government Vice Mayor Xu Jian,<br /><br />His Excellency, Ambassador Cao Zhongming,<br /><br />Bank Indonesia Executive Director Pak Yoga Affandi,<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen,<br /><br />1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Singapore for the CCI-ILSTC Trade and Financial Conference. Today&rsquo;s Conference is especially meaningful for three reasons.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>First, it marks the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative or CCI. The value of the CCI as an important driver for cross-border connectivity cannot be understated. Since the CCI&rsquo;s inception, there has been sustained growth in trade volumes in both directions. And finance has been an important driver, with over US$21.69 billion in cross-border financing deals since the CCI&rsquo;s inception.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>Second, the Conference reflects strong interest and active participation of financial institutions from both sides, working hard on new areas to explore partnerships, and work on cross-border financing deals together. All this is taking place against the backdrop of expanding financial collaboration at the China-Singapore Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation which covers RMB cooperation, capital market connectivity, as well as digital and sustainable finance.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>Third, this Conference brings together, for the first time, the CCI Financial Summit and the CCI-ILSTC International Cooperation Forum. This new format seeks to bring our financial services and trade ecosystems even closer together, more effectively catalysing the discovery of new linkages and business opportunities. This is timely as ASEAN is also Chongqing&rsquo;s largest trading partner accounting for more than 16% of Chongqing&rsquo;s total trade.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;<span> </span>As CCI enters its next decade, we look to how Western China and ASEAN can deepen cooperation, harness key structural trends, and identify new opportunities in future-oriented areas such as green finance and digital connectivity. This will improve the quality and scope of cross-border financial services, enabling our financial sectors to better serve the real economy. In doing so, financial institutions can also help businesses with their green transition efforts and capitalise on digitalisation trends to enhance their business models.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span>Both China and ASEAN will require a vast amount of green financing and investments to transition our economies towards a sustainable, low carbon future.&nbsp;<br /><br />7.&nbsp;<span> </span>Banks from China and Singapore, together with the Singapore Exchange, have been engaging Chongqing corporates on green financing opportunities. For instance, last year, the EU, China and Singapore announced the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy, or M-CGT which enhances the comparability of green taxonomies across the EU, China and Singapore. With the M-CGT, corporates from the three regions will benefit from a common framework which aligns their green activities with international standards, making it easier to access cross-border green financing.&nbsp;<br /><br />8.&nbsp;<span> </span>Aside from capital markets, our financial institutions have also been active in supporting Chongqing&rsquo;s decarbonisation journey. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DBS Bank&rsquo;s provision of a green loan to Singapore Power Group in 2025, to support the district cooling and heating system project at Raffles City Chongqing. This will reduce its carbon footprint by about 30 percent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>OCBC Bank&rsquo;s arranging of a green syndicated loan for EBA Investments<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/opening-remarks-by-mr-leong-sing-chiong-at-the-cci-ilstc-conference#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;in 2024, for their Chongqing IMIX+ Project in the Chaotianmen Business District. This loan, which references internationally recognised Green Loan Principles, helps promote carbon neutrality for the project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span> </span>Meanwhile, digital technology has great potential to break down barriers and make cross-border trade simpler, more efficient, and potentially enhance SME trade connectivity between China and ASEAN.&nbsp;As SMS Tan mentioned in his remarks earlier, Proxtera's network of digital marketplaces will enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Chongqing and the Western Region to access a greater network of buyers and suppliers. The integration of trade discoverability and financing functions on the Proxtera platform can also help these SMEs overcome some of the challenges and complexities of cross-border trade as they seek to access new markets.<br /><br />10.&nbsp;<span> </span>In closing, there is much potential to further grow the trade and financial connectivity between Chongqing and ASEAN. Under the umbrella of the CCI, we hope to bring new ideas, innovations and initiatives that will ensure sustainable growth across our regions. This is in keeping with the JCBC objective of fostering an all-round, high-quality, future-oriented partnership.<br /><br />11.&nbsp;<span> </span>Thanks, and I wish you all a fruitful Conference for the rest of the day.</p>

<title>Opening Remarks At The ASIC Symposium On Australia’s Public And Private Markets, Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo, 10 June 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-at-the-asic-symposium-on-australias-public-and-private-markets-2025611/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-at-the-asic-symposium-on-australias-public-and-private-markets-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The future direction of our public and private markets affects almost every Australian &ndash; and will undoubtedly help shape our economy.</li>
<li>We have a window of opportunity to design the public markets we want to see &ndash; and grease the wheels a bit to get public listings moving.</li>
<li>At the same time, we are at a turning point that could alter the trajectory of private markets to instil further market integrity and confidence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Good evening, everyone. It&rsquo;s good to see the room just about full.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you to ASIC&rsquo;s Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s Public and Private Markets and acknowledge all of our guests. This is the second symposium ASIC is doing, and I hope it will be a permanent feature of our work. Some of you might remember last year we did a symposium on AI &ndash; a subject we&rsquo;ll no doubt have to return to at some point.</p>
<p>Tonight, you&rsquo;ll be hearing from market participants interacting directly with ASIC to answer a very significant question &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>where do we go from here</strong>?</p>
<p>This question affects almost every Australian. Every worker saving for their future retirement. Every mum-and-dad investor trying to get ahead. And every entrepreneur with the next great idea.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s role in this discussion</h2>
<p>On that, many of our conversations have focused on whether ASIC has a role in regulating private markets. I want to be clear that ASIC is in no rush to regulate.</p>
<p>The intent of this work has always been to sharpen our understanding of private markets. The very significant capital in this part of the system is made up of Australians&rsquo; superannuation and insurance monies, so quite frankly it is in the public interest that ASIC take a closer look and lead the debate.</p>
<p>So far what we have heard is that there is an openness to increased supervision and consistent standard-setting across areas like valuations, managing conflicts of interest and fee disclosure.</p>
<p>But fundamentally we need to be very clear about the problem we are solving before jumping to regulation. I&rsquo;ve said many times before regulatory complexity is a problem in Australia, and we need to simplify our approach.</p>
<h2>Today ASIC is moving from listening mode to action mode</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that as a result of our consultation, there are many actionable ideas on the table.</p>
<p>Ideas to help make our markets more open, more accessible, and more attractive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now looking at which ones we can bring to the front burner to fuel growth and activity in our markets. We&rsquo;re moving from listening to action.</p>
<p>This morning&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/" title="25-096MR ASIC clears path for faster IPOs">announcement about changes to the IPO process</a>&nbsp;is an example &ndash; and I hope the beginning of several more.</p>
<p>This change reflects feedback that while our regulatory guardrails are sound, it&rsquo;s time to grease the wheels a bit to get public listings moving.</p>
<p>So, we are creating a more streamlined IPO process which reduces the execution risks associated with listing.</p>
<p>The trial will commence immediately, and I&rsquo;m pleased to say we&rsquo;ve already received enquiries from interested parties.</p>
<p>While regulatory settings aren&rsquo;t a silver bullet, I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to mobilise our teams on simple, common-sense solutions supported by industry &ndash; and there&rsquo;ll be more to come.</p>
<p>I should call out, by the way, the various people in the market who worked so closely with ASIC to get us to where we were this morning. There&rsquo;s a lot of goodwill and professionalism reflected in that engagement.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage and work with industry, Treasury, our peers at other Australian regulators &ndash; some of whom are here tonight &ndash; and broader stakeholders.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to next steps, we&rsquo;ll share our views on how to strengthen our public markets during quarter three of this year.</p>
<p>And in quarter four we&rsquo;ll announce our proposed roadmap for private markets.</p>
<p>This work will be supported in the coming months by our ongoing surveillances, views from market experts and ongoing stakeholder feedback.</p>
<p>To wrap up.</p>
<p>While many of the responses to our discussion paper focused on the here and now, it is critical that we keep an eye on the medium to longer term horizon.</p>
<p>This could be a watershed moment for Australia&rsquo;s markets.</p>
<p>We have a window of opportunity to design the public markets we want to see, not just tomorrow but in five- and 10-years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re at a turning point that could alter the trajectory of private markets to instil further market integrity and confidence.</p>
<p>From here on, our work must look ahead.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a modern, confident, ambitious regulator, ASIC is proud to be leading these issues of the day which will undoubtedly help shape Australia&rsquo;s economy, so that it is fit for the future.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to this evening&rsquo;s discussions. Thank you.</p>

It is therefore still being tested at this initial stage of application and it may be too early to objectively analyse its implications. Nevertheless, there is a majority support within the EACH Membership in favour of a more centralised supervision for CCPs in the EU to different degrees, although certain CCPs have expressed support towards the EMIR 3 status quo. EACH Members would also like to caution against models such as regional supervisory hubs or establishing supervisory colleges with enhanced powers.</li>
<li><b>Recommendations on possible streamlining and simplification of EU law</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH supports removing overlapping reporting requirements between different legislations such as EMIR, REMIT, MAR, MiFID and MiFIR, as well as ensuring a level playing field between EU and non-EU CCPs and non-centrally cleared markets, especially in the context of requirements concerning e.g. anti-procyclicality and margin transparency. EACH also calls for the implementation of the appropriate measures to incentivise clearing by fund managers, insurers and public entities, as well as a reflection on how the principle of proportionality is applied in the context of the DORA framework. Furthermore, Members put forward detailed proposals linked to the ESMA Draft RTS on EMIR 3 approval procedures, underlining the need for leaner and clearer processes.</li>
<li><b>Lowering barriers in post-trading</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members propose to create incentives for the missing Member States and market participants to migrate flows to T2S. Furthermore, we suggest a series of changes to the SFD and FCD legislations to address specific issues concerning the clearing sector such as need to ensure protection under the SFD for all CCPs/clearing houses for their default management rules and procedures, as well as the necessity to expand the list of collateral eligible under the FCD to cover all assets acceptable as collateral.</li>
<li><b>Outsourcing and DLT</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH calls for a clear guidance based on existing rules in the context of outsourcing, and provides an analysis of the advantages and drawbacks&nbsp;regarding the use of DLT in the clearing sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, pending the crucial final publication of the ESMA RTS about the approval procedures for products and changes to risk models, the EMIR 3 level 1 text has represented a major step forward in reducing unnecessary regulatory burden for the market while maintaining financial stability safeguards. The SIU project may be inspired by the achievements of the EMIR 3 level 1 text.</p>

<title>ISDA: Creating Value – IQ June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ever since its establishment 40 years ago, ISDA has worked to enhance the safety and efficiency of derivatives markets. That has motivated everything we do &ndash; from the development of standard documentation and the rollout of new digital solutions to our responses to regulatory consultations.</p>
<p>In our view, safe and efficient markets are critical prerequisites for liquidity and competition &ndash; and that matters. Without deep and liquid markets, it would be more difficult and expensive for corporations, governments, pension funds and insurance companies to use derivatives to transfer unwanted risks, enhance returns and manage their liquidity needs.</p>
<p>The impact of that would be significant. According to a new ISDA report on the value of derivatives, 87.1% of nearly 1,200 major companies in seven major stock indices use over-the-counter derivatives for a variety of reasons, including locking in financing terms, reducing costs and enhancing financial performance. This helps create predictability, which gives companies the<br />confidence to borrow, invest and hire.</p>
<p>In this issue of IQ, we spotlight that report and explore how and why different types of firms use derivatives and the value they bring to individual companies and the broader economy.</p>
<p>The report was published to coincide with ISDA&rsquo;s 40th anniversary, and we continue our&nbsp;<span>IQ</span>&nbsp;anniversary series by looking at how ISDA and its members have worked to address some of the biggest challenges ever to face derivatives markets &ndash; from the rollout of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives to the transition from LIBOR. The solutions that were developed &ndash; the ISDA<br />Standard Initial Margin Model and the IBOR fallbacks &ndash; are great examples of ISDA fulfilling its core mission: maintaining the safety and efficiency of derivatives markets.</p>
<p>This issue also includes a review of ISDA&rsquo;s 39th Annual General Meeting, which took place in Amsterdam last month, with nearly 800 delegates from around the world. The flagship event was an opportunity to reflect on ISDA&rsquo;s achievements over the past 40 years and to consider the future trends that will shape the derivatives market. Save the date for ISDA&rsquo;s 40th AGM, which will take place in Boston on April 28-30, 2026.</p>

This milestone marks the debut of the first national securities exchange designed for global access and approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer 23-hour weekday trading of U.S. equities.</p>
<p>Beginning on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 29</span>, 24X National Exchange will offer trading of U.S. equities from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET</span>&nbsp;on weekdays.</p>
<p>The new Exchange will enable both institutional and retail investors anywhere in the world to trade U.S. equities via participating broker-dealers across nearly the entire day, five days a week. It will operate under full SEC regulatory oversight and with all the standard investor protections afforded to national exchanges.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange will focus its initial efforts on meeting the growing demand for overnight trading in U.S. equities among tech savvy retail investors throughout the APAC region.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange CEO and Founder&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Dmitri Galinov</span>&nbsp;said: "We're proud to lead the next chapter in exchange evolution as we bring extended hours trading to retail traders around the world. With this first stage launch, we're one big step closer to making 23-hour weekday trading a reality for U.S. equities worldwide. 24X National Exchange will enable unprecedented access, flexibility, and speed for market participants in every global location whenever they want to trade.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange received SEC approval last November to operate 23/5 trading hours, subject to the implementation of necessary modifications to Equity Data Plans and a subsequent rule filing with the SEC confirming compliance with the Securities Exchange Act.</p>
<p>Pending final approvals and market infrastructure alignment, 24X National Exchange will transition to operating from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday</span>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">8:00 p.m. ET on Friday</span>, with a one-hour daily operational pause for software maintenance and testing. The launch date for the Exchange's second stage will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>"The initial launch of 24X National Exchange is the culmination of years of innovation, regulatory engagement, and commitment to global market access," Galinov added. "Setting the launch date for our new Exchange is a defining moment &ndash; not just for our company, but for the future of U.S. equity trading."</p>
<p>24X National Exchange is built on a robust, high-performance technology infrastructure powered by MEMX Technologies, ensuring a seamless, resilient, and cost-effective trading experience.</p>
<p>Like NYSE and NASDAQ, 24X National Exchange will observe U.S. market holidays.</p>

<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, an LSEG business, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stepstonegroup.com/">StepStone</a>&nbsp;announced today they have signed a proposed partnership to jointly develop private asset indices, data, and analytics products.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>The proposed partnership will combine FTSE Russell&rsquo;s expertise in design, development, calculation and management&nbsp;of category defining indices across asset classes, with StepStone&rsquo;s leading private markets solutions platform and deep data driven insights across multiple private market asset classes.</p>
<p>The partnership encompasses the development and delivery of market leading reference indices for a full spectrum of private asset allocations, allowing asset owners to better benchmark the performance of private markets portfolios within a total &ldquo;real return&rdquo; portfolio view and asset managers to develop products tracking these daily indices.</p>
<p>FTSE Russell and StepStone expect the initial cohort of daily indices to be launched this year, with further indices and supporting analytical tools to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Fiona Bassett, CEO, FTSE Russell, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our agreement with StepStone and its intended delivery of private asset indices and benchmarking tools further strengthens FTSE Russell&rsquo;s position as a leading multi-asset class index and benchmark provider. With the continued growth in private asset allocation and growing client demand, it is essential for us not only to deliver leading indices in this asset class but to work with partners aligned to our commitment to transparency, rules-based methodologies, robust data provenance and investability. With StepStone&rsquo;s broad, in-depth private markets dataset, we have chosen a great partner with which to build this offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mike McCabe, Head of Strategy, StepStone, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As private markets have become more meaningful components of investors&rsquo; portfolios, the need for integrating views of risk and return across the total portfolio has become critical for investment decision makers.&nbsp; With a growing portion of the global economy remaining private not only for longer, but potentially indefinitely, we need to pave a pathway for further easing the access to differentiated sources of investment returns.&nbsp; Partnering with FTSE Russell will unleash the power and scale of our private markets data &ndash; contained within our proprietary technology platform, SPI by StepStone &ndash; to drive these goals forward.&nbsp; FTSE Russell&rsquo;s leading index, benchmarking and technology platform underpinned by its client-centered approach gives us confidence that in partnering we can deliver a solution that is consistent with our mission to be the trusted partner of choice in private markets solutions globally.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission: Kevin Carmichael Sentenced To Four Years For Defrauding Strike Holdings Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announces that Mr. Kevin Carmichael has been sentenced to four years in jail for defrauding investors in Strike Holdings Inc., as well as making misleading statements to investors and trading securities without registration. In addition to the jail term, Mr. Carmichael was also ordered to pay restitution to harmed investors totaling $22.7 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael was a director and officer of both Strike Holdings and a related company, KM Strike Management (KMSM). He entered a guilty plea in the Ontario Court of Justice on January 8, 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carmichael&rsquo;s actions had a profound impact on investors, creating stress and hardship in the lives of hard-working people who put their trust in him,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President, Enforcement, at the OSC. &ldquo;Misleading investors through falsified reports is illegal, and the OSC will continue to take action to protect investors, and the integrity of our capital markets. We also want to thank the Halton Region Police Service for their support on this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael was co-accused with Michael Aonso, the other director and officer of Strike Holdings and KMSM. Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Aonso were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/michael-aonso-and-kevin-carmichael-charged-securities-act-offences">charged in March 2022</a>. Mr. Aonso pleaded guilty in November 2024 to unregistered trading and illegal distribution of securities. Mr. Aonso will appear in the Ontario Court of Justice on September 23, 2025, for sentencing.</p>
<p>This case was brought by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. To do this, they often partner and collaborate with other law enforcement agencies and police forces. The OSC gratefully acknowledges the investigative support of the Halton Regional Police Service in this matter.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>
<h4>Background:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In June 2019, knowing Strike&rsquo;s TD accounts held only about USD $230,000, Carmichael approached TD Bank and claimed Strike had USD $97M on deposit. He provided forged statements to TD Bank in support of the claim that TD had lost the funds through fraud or error. In early 2021, Strike raised over $900,000 by issuing a debenture to fund litigation against TD Bank to &ldquo;recover&rdquo; the $97M. Carmichael participated in the debenture raise knowing he had forged the documents on which the proposed litigation was based.</li>

<title>EBA Publishes No Action Letter On The Interplay Between Payment Services Directive (PSD2/3) And Markets In Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a&nbsp;No Action letter advising the EU Commission, EU Council and EU Parliament to ensure that, in the long term, EU law needs to avoid a dual authorisation under two pieces of EU law for the activity of transacting electronic money tokens (EMTs). While the existing Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) still applies, the letter advises national competent authorities (NCAs) to enforce authorisation of PSD2 for a specified subset only of crypto asset service providers (CASPs) that transact EMTs, to do so only after a transition period that ends on 2 March 2026, and then to deprioritise specified PSD2 provisions.</span></p>
<p>The letter assesses the provisions set out in MiCA and PSD2 and advises NCAs under PSD2 to view the transfer of crypto assets as a payment service under PSD2 where they&nbsp;entail EMTs and are carried out by the entities on behalf of their clients. It sets out provisions&nbsp;to regard the custody and administration of EMTs as a payment service and to regard a custodial wallet as a payment account where the wallet is held in the name of one or more clients and allows to send and receive EMTs to and from third parties.</p>
<p>For these services, the No Action letter advises NCAs to require an authorisation under PSD2 only from 2 March 2026 onwards and, during the authorisation process, to apply streamlined procedures that make maximum use of information that legal entities provide during their CASP authorisation process.</p>
<p>Once an authorisation as a payment services provider is held, NCAs are advised not to prioritise the supervision and enforcement of several elements of PSD2, such as safeguarding, the disclosure of information to consumers (pertaining to the level of applicable charges, the maximum execution time of payment transactions, the unique identifier such as IBAN, and open banking). However, NCAs are also advised to insist on the compliance with other PSD2 provisions, such as strong customer authentication (SCA) for&nbsp;accessing custodial wallets that qualify as&nbsp;payment account&nbsp;and the initiating of EMT transfers, the reporting of payment fraud,&nbsp;and the cumulative calculation of own funds requirements. This is to ensure equally high standards of consumer protection regardless of whether a consumer is using EMTs or more traditional funds as a means of payment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, NCAs are advised not to consider as payment services (and therefore not to subject to the application of PSD2, including its provisions on licensing)&nbsp;the &lsquo;exchange of crypto-assets for funds&rsquo; and &lsquo;exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets&rsquo; as defined in MiCA. Additionally,&nbsp;the EBA advises NCAs&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to regard as a payment service cases where&nbsp;crypto-asset service providers intermediate the purchase of any crypto-assets with EMTs, and,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to enforce the application of PSD2 nor to require an authorisation under PSD2 in such cases.</p>
<p>This advice will result in a large number of EMT transactions not&nbsp;being subject to&nbsp;PSD2 requirements during the intervening period while the Directive still applies.&nbsp;The EBA bases this advice solely on the acknowledgement that any alternative advice would require a much larger number of CASPs to obtain a second authorization. The&nbsp;EBA considers such an alternative to be undesirable, given the&nbsp;burden that dual authorisation would impose on CASPs.</p>
<p>By contrast, the EBA does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;base this advice on the conviction that an authorisation as a CASP under MiCA is sufficient to address the risks that arise from EMT transactions. On the contrary, the success of PSD1, PSD2 and EMD over the past 15 years in bringing about a secure and competitive market for payment services in the EU has shown that for retail payments to be able effectively to fulfil their role in a modern society, consumers and other market actors should be adequately protected and have a high degree of confidence in the stability of the market and the reliability of payment transactions.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has issued the letter in response to a request received from the European Commission in December 2024 to address, in close cooperation with ESMA, issues arising from the interplay between MiCA and PSD2.&nbsp;The EBA&rsquo;s competence to deliver the letter in the form of an Opinion is based on Article 9c of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>

<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning five individuals and five sham charities located abroad that are prominent financial supporters of Hamas&rsquo;s Military Wing and its terrorist activities.&nbsp; The individuals and entities sanctioned today are responsible for funding Hamas&rsquo;s Military Wing under the pretense of conducting humanitarian work, both internationally and in Gaza. &nbsp;Treasury is also targeting a separate fraudulent charity linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>As outlined in&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2F136%2F2024-National-Terrorist-Financing-Risk-Assessment.pdf/1/010101975a41d8d8-706dfc65-6d2c-4d5b-8deb-e69819b0abf7-000000/5VCJI0l_ZrVr3Uh7vFrSPxBJLYI18p3QZcHJqKdSyXI=408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Treasury&rsquo;s 2024 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment</span></a><span>, terrorist financing risks still exist primarily in the context of sham charities abroad.&nbsp; This includes terrorist networks that establish seemingly legitimate charitable non-profit organizations (NPOs) under the guise of providing humanitarian assistance but instead are primarily utilized for funneling money to terrorist organizations.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action underscores the importance of safeguarding the charitable sector from abuse by terrorists like Hamas and the PFLP, who continue to leverage sham charities as fronts for funding their terrorist and military operations,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender</strong>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Treasury will continue to use all available tools to prevent Hamas, the PFLP, and other terrorist actors from exploiting the humanitarian situation in Gaza to fund their violent activities at the expense of their own people.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Today&rsquo;s action, which is being taken pursuant to the counterterrorism authority in Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, highlights the abuse of the nonprofit sector by terrorist financiers to illicitly generate, store, and move funds.&nbsp; The PFLP was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. Department of State in October 1997 and October 2001, respectively. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span face="times new roman,times"><strong><span>TERRORISTS&rsquo; EXPLOITATION OF THE NPO SECTOR</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Hamas and the PFLP have long abused the trust of the international community and public support for legitimate humanitarian causes to fund their terrorist activities and bring violence to the Israeli and Palestinian people. &nbsp;As Hamas continues to hold hostages, including two American citizens, following the October 7, 2023 attack, Treasury remains committed to exposing terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to abuse the NPO sector to raise funds under the fa&ccedil;ade of humanitarian support.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>This helps reduce the overall terrorist financing risk of the NPO sector by publicly identifying financing networks in support of terrorist organizations and activities. &nbsp;For more information about how Hamas finances its terrorist activities, see the&nbsp;</span><span>Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fincen.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-10%2FFinCEN_Alert_Terrorist_Financing_FINAL508.pdf/1/010101975a41d8d8-706dfc65-6d2c-4d5b-8deb-e69819b0abf7-000000/3zxnFPWGIwWSXu8opJlaU63U_QsHncFMf_d5kpgaLqo=408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Alert to Financial Institutions to Counter Financing to Hamas and its Terrorist Activities</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><strong><span>HAMAS AND PFLP FUNDRAISING SCHEMES</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Hamas and the PFLP have a long history of abusing the NPO and charitable sectors. &nbsp;Some of these NPOs and charities are entirely co-opted and run by these designated terrorists, with their links to Hamas and the PFLP intentionally obscured in order to evade sanctions.&nbsp; This allows Hamas and the PFLP to exploit the sympathy and generosity of the international public at the expense of the Palestinian people.</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>The Gaza-based charity<strong>&nbsp;Al Weam Charitable Society&nbsp;</strong>(Al Weam) is clandestinely controlled by Hamas and fully integrated into Hamas&rsquo;s military wing.&nbsp; This secrecy has allowed Al Weam to raise funds and implement projects by international donors, many of whom are unwitting</span><span>of the organization&rsquo;s ties to Hamas.&nbsp; Al Weam has also employed Hamas members throughout the organization, including its Chairman of the Board of Directors,&nbsp;<strong>Muhammad Sami Muhammad Abu Marei&nbsp;</strong>(Abu Marei), who is a Hamas military operative and facilitated fundraising on behalf of Hamas using Al Weam.</span></span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Natasha Vij Greiner, Director of the Division of Investment Management, will depart the agency effective July 4, 2025, after more than 23 years of public service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natasha&rsquo;s steadfast leadership and strong judgment have been invaluable assets to the SEC throughout her long and distinguished career,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;I am grateful for her strategic counsel since I&rsquo;ve become Chairman. Her unwavering commitment to the agency&rsquo;s mission and her ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes with clarity will have a lasting effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management's work is critical to ensuring that investors have access to high-quality investment opportunities from which they can make well-informed investing decisions. It has primary responsibility for administering the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which includes overseeing investment companies (e.g., mutual funds, closed-end funds, business development companies, unit investment trusts, variable insurance products, and exchange-traded funds) and investment advisers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I reflect on my 23 years at the SEC, I am filled with gratitude for the incredible journey across the divisions of Investment Management, Enforcement, Examinations, and Trading and Markets,&rdquo; said Ms. Greiner. &ldquo;It has been an extraordinary privilege to serve in various capacities at the SEC, culminating as Director of the Division of Investment Management. Throughout my tenure, I have witnessed firsthand the dedication and integrity of the staff that define this remarkable agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Greiner was named Director of the Division of Investment Management in March 2024. She previously served as Deputy Director of the Division of Examinations and as the National Associate Director of the Investment Adviser/Investment Company examination program, which includes the Private Funds Unit, and was the Associate Director of the Home Office IA/IC examination program.</p>
<p>She began her SEC career in the Division of Examinations (formerly OCIE) as a broker-dealer examiner and has served in a variety of roles across the agency, including Acting Chief Counsel and Assistant Chief Counsel in the Division of Trading and Markets, where she provided legal and policy advice to the Commission on rules affecting market participants and the operation of the securities markets. Before that, Ms. Greiner worked in the Division of Enforcement, including in its Asset Management Unit, where she investigated possible violations of the federal securities laws and litigated matters in federal district court and administrative proceedings.</p>
<p>Throughout her career at the SEC, Ms. Greiner has been consistently recognized for her outstanding achievements and efforts. She received the Chairman&rsquo;s Award for Excellence in 2015 and again in 2018, and she received the Chairman&rsquo;s Award for Serving the Interests of Main Street Investors in 2019.</p>
<p>Ms. Greiner received her J.D. from The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law and graduated cum laude with a B.S. degree from James Madison University.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it will immediately resume processing new and pending registration applications of investment advisers with their principal office and place of business in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement follows successful discussions between staff from the SEC and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regarding (1) the ability of FINMA-supervised, SEC-registered investment advisers located in Switzerland to provide their books and records, including personal data, directly to SEC staff, and (2) the SEC&rsquo;s ability to conduct on-site visits of these entities in Switzerland, consistent with the U.S. securities laws and Swiss law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased to announce that the SEC stands ready to provide prompt consideration of the registration applications from Swiss investment advisers. These applications have languished for too many years, and it is well past time that we resume this process,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;Longstanding interest from foreign investment advisers in registration demonstrates the value of the U.S. regulatory framework, and we look forward to expanding access to U.S. capital markets. I thank my FINMA counterparts for their collaboration and welcome their actions to make this possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The companies listed on BME's growth markets (<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx">BME Growth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup</a>) have once again demonstrated their growth capacity, with a compound annual growth rate of 27.7% in their revenue over the past ten years. This data consolidates the role of these markets as key platforms for driving the development of innovative and high-potential companies in Spain. In the last year, the turnover of these companies grew by 6.5%.<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx"></a></p>
<p>The expanding companies, a segment that includes the companies with the highest projection within these markets, have recorded even more notable growth, with an annualized increase of 30.6% in their revenue over the same period.</p>

<p>In terms of operating profitability, the total EBITDA of BME Growth and Scaleup companies has grown by 23% annually over the last decade, and by 23.3% in the last year alone.

<p>All of this has occurred in a context marked by high uncertainty stemming from the international geopolitical environment, which has affected financial markets, supply chains, and financing costs.

<p>These data consolidate BME Growth and Scaleup as reference environments for companies seeking financing, visibility, and professionalization on their path towards sustainable growth.</p>
<p>The growth markets of BME welcomed 23 new companies last year and so far in 2025, another five have already debuted.</p>

<h4><b>KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>A weaker US Dollar, stable oil prices, and dovish fiscal policy in China and Europe provides a positive back drop for Emerging Markets</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Companies in China and India are driving innovation, benefiting from consumption-led growth across Emerging Markets and beyond</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Latin American equity and bonds, supported by attractive valuations, stand to benefit from United States strategic retrenchment</b></li>

<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Pedestrian index returns over the past 15 years underline the importance of investing actively in these markets</b></li>
</ul>
<p>On Thursday 5 June, Aubrey Capital Management (&ldquo;Aubrey&rdquo;) and LarrainVial hosted a high-level investment seminar in London, bringing together investment professionals, economists, policymakers and clients to examine how shifting global power dynamics are reshaping the investment opportunity in Emerging Markets.</p>
<p>The event,&nbsp;<i>Navigating Shifting Narratives in Emerging Markets</i>, featured presentations from Louis-Vincent Gave, Co-Founder and CEO of Gavekal, John Ewart, Investment Manager (Aubrey), Camila Guzm&aacute;n, Portfolio Manager (LarrainVial Asset Management), and former Chilean Finance Minister, Ignacio Briones. The speakers were joined in discussions by Aubrey&rsquo;s Founder and Investment Manager, Andrew Dalrymple, and Fernando Larra&iacute;n C.,<b>&nbsp;</b>President of LarrainVial. Anna Macdonald, Head of Private Clients at Aubrey, moderated the seminar.</p>
<p>Louis-Vincent Gave opened the event by framing 2025 as a year of global inflection, reflecting on the rise of &ldquo;Fortress America&rdquo;. John Ewart provided a company-level view of the opportunities in Emerging Markets, focusing on Asia. He emphasised the growth of domestic consumption in countries like India and China and presented several examples of world-class businesses in areas such as electric vehicles, e-commerce and fintech. Camila Guzm&aacute;n offered a strong case for Latin American Equities, describing the region as &ldquo;under-owned, undervalued, and under-touched.&rdquo; Former Chilean Finance Minister Ignacio Briones gave a detailed presentation on Chile&rsquo;s recent pension reform, which was passed earlier this year after more than a decade of political debate.</p>
<p>The seminar took place in the historic Livery Hall of the City of London&rsquo;s Guildhall, and was attended by over 130 people representing financial institutions, pension funds, wealth managers, intermediaries and consultants, who braved the London weather. Representatives from the UK and Chilean governments were also present, led by Lord Roger Liddle, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Trade Envoy for the Andean region, and Her Excellency Ximena Fuentes, Ambassador of Chile to the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Rings Bell On New Type Of Private Stock Market In Growth Boost</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>A new type of private stock market will be launched later in 2025 after the FCA announced the final rules for its Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>PISCES is a new type of platform where shares in private companies can be traded. It will open the door to more opportunities for investors, facilitating their access to growth companies. Private companies can tap into a broader range of investors and asset managers and PISCES offers exits for shareholders to sell up.</p>
<p>As companies choose to stay private for longer, there is demand for investors to trade private company shares easily and efficiently in an organised marketplace. PISCES meets this demand by allowing secondary trading of these shares. Companies can set the floor and ceiling of share prices, and have a say over who can buy their shares.</p>
<p>Access to PISCES will be limited to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, sophisticated investors and employees of participating companies. Investors will be provided with information about the risks involved to help them make informed decisions.</p>
<p>As set out in the FCA&rsquo;s letter to the PM outlining the regulator&rsquo;s approach to support growth, PISCES can unlock capital investment and liquidity.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This bold design rebalances risk, but it is bold risk-taking that made the UK the leading financial centre it is today. The new platforms will give investors greater access and confidence to invest in exciting new companies, while early backers and employees can sell up and invest again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;PISCES is the latest step in the FCA&rsquo;s wide-ranging reforms to the UK&rsquo;s markets to boost growth and competitiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emma Reynolds, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:</p>
<p>'PISCES is a great example of industry, regulators and the government working together to go further and faster on innovative reforms to strengthen UK capital markets, supporting economic growth and putting more money in people&rsquo;s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
<p>'I welcome the FCA's announcement, which follows our legislation and opens PISCES to industry. This also builds on our announcements on a stamp taxes on shares exemption for PISCES transactions, and on employees retaining the tax advantages on eligible shares traded.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the Policy Statement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-29-private-intermittent-securities-and-capital-exchange-system" title="PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox arrangements">PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox Arrangements</a>&nbsp;(June 2025).</li>
<li>The platform will be delivered through a sandbox, which will allow the FCA to test the design before finalising a permanent regime in 2030. The sandbox is now open, with shares likely to be traded later in 2025. Trading systems could include periodic auctions, as well as occasional and time-limited periods of continuous trading.</li>
<li>PISCES will be developed using a financial markets infrastructure (FMI) sandbox. This will be the second use of the FMI Sandbox powers after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-12-digital-securities-sandbox-joint-policy-statement-final-guidance" title="PS24/12: Digital Securities Sandbox joint Policy Statement and Final Guidance">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>.</li>

<li>The sandbox environment will allow government and regulators to check it is working properly. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms wishing to run a PISCES platform will have to apply to the FCA, and once approved will be able to run intermittent trading events. The FCA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/update-pisces-pre-application-support" title="Update on PISCES and pre-application support">pre-application support</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/pisces/sandbox-apply-run-platform" title="PISCES Sandbox: apply to run a platform">application support</a>&nbsp;for firms interested in applying to be a PISCES operator.</li>
<li>The regulator and government will use any lessons from the sandbox period to improve the regime before making it permanent.&nbsp;</li>

<p>This latest transaction brings the Bank&rsquo;s total outstanding on Nasdaq Dubai to USD 2.5 billion across five listings.

Ahmed Saad, DCEO of Sharjah Islamic Bank rang the market opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai in the presence of Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>

<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM,</b> said: "This listing reflects more than capital raising &mdash;it's part of a broader shift as regional institutions like Sharjah Islamic Bank lead the deepening of local debt markets.

<title>ASIC Clears Path For Faster IPOs</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos-2025610/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos-2025610/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Entities listing on the ASX via the fast-track process now have access to a shorter initial public offering (IPO) timetable designed to reduce deal execution risk as part of a two-year trial announced by ASIC today.</p>
<p>ASIC will now informally review eligible offer documents two weeks prior to public lodgement, which could reduce the IPO timetable by up to a week.</p>
<p>The changes mean ASIC will engage with an issuer prior to the exposure period, which decreases the need for supplementary and replacement documents and extensions to the exposure period. This also reduces the risk that market volatility and consequential pricing changes may impact investor interest in the IPO.</p>
<p>The changes also include a &lsquo;no action&rsquo; position by ASIC that now allows eligible companies to accept retail investor applications during the public exposure period for new listings, cutting down the administrative timeline of the IPO process.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the initiatives had been developed in response to the decline in Australian IPOs and public companies, highlighted in ASIC&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/dp-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-a-discussion-paper-on-the-dynamics-between-public-and-private-markets/" title="DP Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets">discussion paper on the evolving dynamics between public and private markets</a>, and form part of the agency&rsquo;s regulatory simplification focus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Creating a more streamlined IPO process underscores our commitment to ensuring our public markets remain attractive to companies and investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Greater deal certainty for companies should help deliver more IPOs, which means more investment opportunities so companies can expand, increase jobs and ultimately economic growth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our initial public offerings are the lowest they have been in over a decade, and companies are de-listing. Meanwhile, our secondary capital raising settings continue to be globally recognised for their speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earlier this year, we outlined our concerns for the future of public markets and called for actionable ideas to ensure our markets remain open, efficient and attractive to investors. I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to work with industry participants and mobilise our teams to respond to actionable ideas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we do not see regulatory settings as the silver bullet, we have received lots of ideas and are considering further regulatory adjustments to support a strong and well-functioning market,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>The changes still allow for concerns to be raised during the public exposure period and the issue of shares and quotation will still only occur once the exposure period has ended.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s new approach comes into effect today, and is the first in a series of regulatory changes it is considering to enhance and improve the attractiveness of Australia&rsquo;s public markets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On 26 February 2025, ASIC released a discussion paper which explored the changing dynamics in capital markets in Australia and abroad, including declining listings on public markets, the rapid growth in investment capital allocated to private markets and the growing significance of superannuation funds in markets.</p>
<h2>Trial process</h2>
<p>The trial process is available to entities seeking the ASX fast-track listing (Eligible Entities / Eligible Companies) as part of a two-year trial starting today. ASX Fast-track is available to entities that will have a market capitalisation greater than $100 million upon listing and no ASX imposed escrow.</p>
<p>Eligible Entities can provide a pathfinder prospectus or pathfinder PDS to ASIC on a confidential basis, at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement for review. A pathfinder prospectus or PDS is a draft document distributed to professional or sophisticated investors which does not seek subscriptions from retail investors and is designed to facilitate the pricing of securities.</p>
<p>ASIC will endeavour to complete its review of the Pathfinder in the 14-day period prior to formal lodgement. ASIC will then generally not need to extend the 7-day exposure period to 14 days after lodgement other than where material new information comes to light or is included in the lodged prospectus / PDS. ASIC will retain its ability to use stop orders up until listing.</p>
<h2>Conditions of trial</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entity must be eligible for the ASX Fast Track application process.</li>
<li>Entities must email the Pathfinder to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:prelodgement@asic.gov.au">prelodgement@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement.</li>
<li>The Pathfinder must not differ in any material respect from the lodged prospectus / PDS other than for final pricing, offer amount and related metrics / financial information and as otherwise agreed with ASIC.</li>
<li>Normal ASIC review processes may apply in situations where there is an extended delay between the informal review completing and formal lodgement.</li>
<li>A Pathfinder review by ASIC does not endorse the contents of the Pathfinder or preclude ASIC or a third party from taking action in respect of the lodged prospectus / PDS or the offer it contains.</li>
<li>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the trial at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ASIC no-action position</h2>
<p>ASIC is also announcing a class no-action position where an Eligible Company accepts an application during the exposure period. This aligns the process for prospectuses with PDSs, simplifying the process by removing the need to wait for the exposure period to lapse.</p>
<p>ASIC does not intend to take action for a contravention of subsections 727(3) or (6) of the Corporations Act where a person accepts an application for non-quoted securities offered under a disclosure document during the period referred to in subsection 727(3) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s no-action position applies only to the offers of non-quoted securities under a disclosure document issued by an Eligible Company in accordance with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act made during the trial period.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s general policy on &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; positions also applies. Their status is set out in Regulatory Guide 108&nbsp;<em>No-action letters</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-108-no-action-letters/" title="RG 108 No-action letters">RG 108</a>). In particular, it should be noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>a no-action letter is an expression of regulatory intention about how to exercise ASIC&rsquo;s powers. The purpose of a no-action letter is to provide an indication as to the future regulatory action that we might take. Entities do not need to apply to ASIC to avail themselves of this no-action position.</li>
<li>an ASIC no-action letter does not necessarily preclude third parties (including the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions) from taking legal action in relation to the same conduct or conduct of that kind. Nor does it prevent a court from holding that particular conduct infringes the relevant legislation. ASIC does not represent that the conduct covered by the no-action letter will not be held to contravene the relevant legislation. Nor does ASIC undertake to intervene in an action brought by third parties in respect of such conduct.</li>
<li>a no-action letter is not a guarantee that ASIC will not take action in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position during the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position at any time.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Roundtable On DeFi And The American Spirit, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the panelists and attendees today for the Commission&rsquo;s fifth roundtable organized by the Crypto Task Force, entitled &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Reflecting on the &ldquo;American Spirit&rdquo; brings to mind the expedition of Merriweather Lewis and William Clark. About 220 years ago on May 14, 1804, Lewis and Clark set out to explore the new Louisiana Territory, purchased the prior year by President Thomas Jefferson.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The size of the United States had doubled overnight, but there were no reliable maps or established routes through the new land. Despite this daunting challenge, Lewis and Clark entered the wilderness to carry out their mission.</p>
<p>While perhaps not nearly as fraught with personal danger, the Commission is similarly navigating through challenging new terrain and plunging into the regulatory wilderness under the leadership of Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force. While the Commission&rsquo;s tools &ndash; such as roundtables, public consultation, and economic analysis &ndash; may be different, I am confident that our expedition can succeed in updating our rulebook to open up new opportunities for American investors and businesses.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s treatment of decentralized finance and other emerging technologies over the past four years was not conducive to regulatory transparency and discouraged entrepreneurs and those developing DeFi from engaging with the Commission. However, that approach has recently changed under the Crypto Task Force, which is charged with coordinating the Commission&rsquo;s effort to find answers to many pressing questions. Thus far, they have changed the SEC&rsquo;s posture on crypto, embraced difficult regulatory questions, and promoted transparency by engaging with the market participants driving innovation and change.</p>
<p>This SEC is committed to high quality regulation. High quality regulation takes time and administrative processes matter. For those who are involved in the development of DeFi, please be patient and work with the Commission and its staff towards achieving the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Although I am uncertain as to what &ldquo;perfect regulation&rdquo; may look like, the path towards it begins with seeking input from the public. This journey towards regulatory clarity will likely be frustrating, and may move in fits and starts. However, by learning from DeFi innovators and advocates, the Commission has a better chance at regulating securities transactions involving DeFi and protecting American investors who utilize decentralized financial services and products.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s participants will provide knowledge and insight about DeFi&rsquo;s development and the existing regulatory barriers preventing growth. Such contributions will help the Commission attempt to strike the proper balance between its role as a regulator and its mandate to foster competition, efficiency, and capital formation.</p>
<p>In DeFi, there is a new landscape of opportunities. People can transact directly with each other without relying on banks or other centralized intermediaries. The Commission should not refrain from engaging in oversight of novel areas simply because it involves thinking outside the existing framework.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The legacy regulatory regime under the federal securities laws presupposes the existence and necessity of numerous intermediaries. I look forward to hearing from today&rsquo;s panelists as to whether such presumptions remain necessary.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>In which types of situations do DeFi systems and smart contracts potentially eliminate the need for a financial intermediary and how?</li>
<li>In what situations should DeFi systems be deemed to fall outside the scope of the securities laws?</li>
<li>What key safeguards are necessary when the securities laws apply to these arrangements?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s journey took time to complete and carved out an important path to facilitate westward expansion. In so doing, they provided a valuable contribution to American progress. Today&rsquo;s roundtable reflects the SEC&rsquo;s commitment to continued progress and its willingness to consider the role of emerging technologies. As the Commission continues to move through the regulatory wilderness, it should remain true to its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation in its efforts to respond to market innovation.</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to the conversation.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Final Crypto Task Force Roundtable: Where We Go From Here, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. As we begin the final event of this Crypto Task Force series, I think this is a good opportunity to reflect on what has come out of these roundtables and where the Task Force, and the Commission, are going from here.</p>
<p>These roundtables have highlighted that &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; is far from a monolith. We have heard a markedly diverse set of viewpoints, from many different segments of the industry.</p>
<p>We have heard, for example, from many non-SEC registered entities with varying views on whether they or their products should be required to register and be subject to SEC jurisdiction. I expect that this will be a key theme of today&rsquo;s DeFi panel. Back in November 2021, I wrote an article<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;detailing my views on the opportunities and challenges of DeFi, which I believe require industry and regulatory collaboration to develop compliant solutions. The issues I raised in that article related to market structure, transparency, and retail investor protection, among others, still remain questions today, so I look forward to hearing the panelists&rsquo; views on how we should approach these challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond issues related to registration and jurisdictional lines, other roundtables have focused on current SEC registrants who want to continue operating under SEC oversight, but with altered regulatory requirements tailored to new types of products and technologies.</p>
<p>In addition to these varied and sometimes competing regulatory views, we have heard different opinions on the technologies underlying digital asset products and services. We have heard panelists highlight advantages or disadvantages of particular technologies, and give differing predictions on their capabilities to function effectively as part of a large, complex securities market.</p>
<p>In sum, these roundtables have given us a lot to grapple with, to say the least. While the series was billed as a &ldquo;spring sprint towards crypto clarity,&rdquo; I am unsure whether we&rsquo;ve identified much that can be simply or quickly clarified. When it comes to crypto, it does not appear to me that the SEC is facing problems with ready or easy solutions. What we are facing is heightened expectations of rolling out major changes &mdash;quickly&mdash; to pave the way for crypto expansion into the capital markets.</p>
<p>With issues this complex and stakes this high, it&rsquo;s better to do it right than fast. We need to grapple with the tough questions through the legally sanctioned process of formal rulemaking, as Chairman Atkins alluded to earlier, with full opportunity for notice and comment and public interest findings. I look forward to engaging with my fellow Commissioners, the staff, and the public on what I hope will be a thoughtful and mission-driven rulemaking process for this space. Thank you.</p>

<title>DeFining The American Spirit, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins, Commissioner Crenshaw, and Commissioner Uyeda, and thank you all for joining us in-person or online for the final afternoon of the Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s Spring Sprint roundtable series: &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you especially to our moderator, Troy Paredes, who is returning after his excellent performance at our first roundtable back in March. Troy, we are grateful to have you here again as we wrap up. I also appreciate today&rsquo;s panelists for being part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Over the past four months, the Task Force has held roundtables on security status, trading, tokenization, and custody.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These roundtables have provided invaluable input to the Commission, the Task Force, and the rest of the Commission staff&mdash;input that has informed our views and improved our efforts. The Task Force, which hit the ground running in a sprint of roundtables, intends to keep running the clarity marathon, and the perspectives of roundtable participants will help determine the course.</p>
<p>Our final roundtable is on DeFi, or decentralized finance. You may ask: What business does the SEC have in talking about regulating DeFi? Absolutely none is a reasonable answer, so with that, we will wrap up this roundtable: Thank you everyone for attending! OK, not so fast. Life is not that simple. Even getting to&nbsp;<i>no</i>&nbsp;regulation requires some talking.</p>
<p>What is DeFi? Bitcoin is &ldquo;decentralized finance,&rdquo; but it may not be what first comes to mind when we think of DeFi. Google says DeFi is &ldquo;a blockchain-based financial system that aims to replace traditional financial institutions with peer-to-peer transactions and smart contracts.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;DeFi brings to mind decentralized networks, which enable people to trade tokens and derivatives, engage in lending, or participate in prediction markets. Although sometimes referred to as DeFi &ldquo;platforms,&rdquo; DeFi is not a&nbsp;<i>place</i>&nbsp;people go to access services that someone else provides and controls; it is software code that people use to engage in the activity of transacting without a centralized intermediary. To channel one of today&rsquo;s panelists, I do not go to a decentralized exchange; I make a decentralized exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>DeFi defies our traditional, permissioned world of intermediaries. It enables a person to engage with her peers through a protocol that is open to everybody on the same transparent terms: no need to get consent from any centralized gatekeeper. At its core, DeFi, which blockchain technology enables, is about the freedom to transact with your peers without permission, interference, or intermediation. And that is why DeFi resonates so deeply with the American spirit.</p>
<p>Also resonant with the American spirit is the ability of people to publish written material without permission. Code is protected speech. Because the First Amendment protects someone who writes a DeFi software protocol and publishes it, the SEC has no authority to demand pre-publication approval rights even for code that could be used to exchange securities. The SEC must not infringe on First Amendment rights by regulating someone who merely publishes code on the basis that others use that code to carry out activity that the SEC has traditionally regulated. If somebody else subsequently violates the law using the software protocol, the user&mdash;not the developer of the software&mdash;should face the music.</p>
<p>But sometimes the writer of a protocol used to exchange securities does more than merely publish it. She also might operate, administer, or maintain a platform through which the code can be accessed and that takes custody of client assets or makes execution decisions for clients. In this and other instances, the coder or her platform might be subject to regulation for that conduct. If that conduct relates to securities, the SEC might have a role to play.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Centralized entities that use DeFi protocols that someone else wrote to serve clients do not get a regulatory pass either. Nor can centralized entities avoid regulation by hiding behind a &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; label; that is DINO, or DeFi-In-Name-Only.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;With centralized entities comes the potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, principal-agent problems, information asymmetries, and other issues common in the traditional finance world&mdash;all the issues DeFi is designed to address. The SEC&rsquo;s efforts are best spent protecting investors, not from their own use of open-source software code to engage in transactions with their peers, nor from writers of such code, but from providers of financial services.</p>
<p>I hope that today&rsquo;s discussion will help us ensure that SEC regulation is able to reach activities and entities properly within its ambit regardless of what label they bear, without prohibiting the exercise of individuals&rsquo; rights to publish code and interact with that code. I now will hand it off to Troy. Thank you all for being here, and I look forward to the discussion.</p>

Although the details in the settlement order are limited, the facts at issue there could help spur discussion of which types of activities the SEC should reach. Coburn was the only person with the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract, as he was the only person with access to the private key for the administrator account, which could be used to change the permissible fees for transacting using EtherDelta or the address of the account to which those fees were directed. The order book sat on a centralized server that was maintained by EtherDelta, rather than on the Ethereum Blockchain. https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2018/34-84553.pdf</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood today released a letter in response to correspondence from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors requesting the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) rescind its preemption regulations.</p>
<p>In the letter, Acting Comptroller Hood reaffirmed the OCC&rsquo;s support and defense of preemption as a cornerstone of the dual banking system that is fundamental to the operation of the federal banking system. The OCC&rsquo;s preemption regulations are consistent with federal law, Supreme Court precedent, and a powerful enabler of local and national prosperity and growth.</p>

<title>US Financial Groups Urge Administration To Address Pattern Of Data Security Lapses At Regulators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, MFA and SIFMA called for significant reforms to how federal financial regulators handle sensitive data following the latest in a series of data breaches that exposed over 148,000 private correspondences containing sensitive supervisory information about U.S. financial institutions. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/data-security-joint-trades/">letter</a>&nbsp;addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the organizations identified concerns with regulators&rsquo; data management practices spanning the previous administration. Weaknesses were identified in February 2025; however, growing threats from hostile nation-states targeting U.S. critical infrastructure serve as a reminder of the urgency to address vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[G]overnment agencies are increasingly the target of persistent and sophisticated nation-state attacks that could disrupt financial markets and our economy,&rdquo; the organizations wrote. &ldquo;It is imperative that federal regulators recognize that they are equally a target of malicious actors and implement the same or substantially similar cybersecurity and incident response practices that they expect financial institutions to maintain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Financial institutions are legally required to share sensitive, proprietary and non-public information with their regulators as part of the supervisory process. This information can range from capital and liquidity management to cybersecurity protocols. However, centralizing large amounts of data can create a prime target for illicit actors seeking to harm U.S. economic security. Government agencies, including regulatory agencies, are increasingly the target of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, both the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency &mdash; the Treasury bureau responsible for supervising the U.S. banking system &mdash; have suffered significant cyber incidents. The latest dates back to 2023 and was identified in early 2025. Here are the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackers compromised the OCC&rsquo;s systems in May 2023.</li>
<li>The OCC did not learn of the suspicious activity until February 2025 &mdash; meaning, hackers likely had access to the OCC&rsquo;s systems for over a year and a half.</li>
<li>The breach exposed an estimated 148,000 emails, some of which may have contained highly sensitive supervisory information that could give hostile nation states ample information to harm America&rsquo;s financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These weaknesses point to a pattern of problems in how U.S. agencies secure data and are held accountable. To mitigate risk and prevent similar problems in the future, the groups made four recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold agencies to the same security and data protection standards as private companies.</li>
<li>Avoid centralizing sensitive data that could affect entire economic sectors and instead allow companies to maintain control and access to their data.</li>
<li>Require regulatory agencies to notify affected companies when things go wrong.</li>
<li>Limit data collection to only what is necessary.</li>
</ol>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you and good afternoon.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is a great pleasure to be with you today. Let me begin by thanking Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force for their organizing today&rsquo;s event, and Commissioner Crenshaw and Commissioner Uyeda for their participation.&nbsp; Of course, I very much thank the roundtable panelists and our moderator, Troy Parades, for their voluntary contribution of time and talent to our endeavor.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s roundtable is titled &ldquo;DeFi and&nbsp;<i>the American Spirit</i>.&rdquo; This is an apt title because the American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, movement.</p>
<p>Blockchains, of course, are a very creative and potentially revolutionary innovation that have us rethinking evidence of ownership and transfer of intellectual and economic property rights.&nbsp; They are shared databases that enable ownership of a type of digital property called crypto assets without reliance on an intermediary or central party. Instead, these peer-to-peer networks incorporate an economic mechanism to encourage participants to validate and maintain the database in accordance with the network&rsquo;s rules. These are free market systems where users pay demand-based fees to network participants to have their transactions included within a so-called &ldquo;block&rdquo; of data with finite storage capacity.</p>
<p>The prior U.S. government administration discouraged Americans from participating in these market-based systems by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions. I am grateful to the Division of Corporation Finance staff for clarifying its view that voluntary participation in a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake network as a &ldquo;miner,&rdquo; &ldquo;validator,&rdquo; or &ldquo;staking-as-a-service&rdquo; provider is not within the scope of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; As happy as I am over that step, it is not a duly promulgated rule with the force of law, so we cannot stop there.&nbsp; The Securities and Exchange Commission must adopt a regulation based on the authority that Congress has given us.</p>
<p>Another core feature of blockchain technology is the ability for individuals to have self-custody of crypto assets in a personal digital wallet. The right to have self-custody of one&rsquo;s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet. I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially where intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.</p>
<p>The prior President&rsquo;s administration undermined innovation in self-custodial digital wallets and other on-chain technologies by asserting through regulatory actions that the developers of such software may be conducting brokerage activity. Engineers should not be subject to the federal securities laws solely for publishing this type of software code. As one court put it, it would be irrational to hold the developer of a self-driving car liable &ndash; here, quoting from the court&rsquo;s decision &ndash; &ldquo;for a third-party&rsquo;s use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank. In those circumstances, one would not sue the car company for facilitating the wrongdoing; they would sue the individual who committed the wrong.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are developing software applications that are designed to function without administration by any operator. The idea of self-executing software code that is accessible to everyone, but controlled by no one, and that enables private, peer-to-peer transactions may sound like science fiction. But, blockchain technology makes possible an entirely new class of software that can perform these functions without an intermediary. I do not believe that we should allow century-old regulatory frameworks to stifle innovation with technologies that could upend and most importantly improve and advance our current, traditional intermediated model.&nbsp; We should not automatically fear the future.</p>
<p>These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises. While centralized platforms waivered and failed under recent stresses, many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Most current securities rules and regulations are premised upon the regulation of issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries. I have asked the Commission staff to explore whether further guidance or rulemaking may be helpful for enabling registrants to transact with these software systems in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>I also am excited about the use of on-chain software systems by issuers and intermediaries to eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity. Current securities regulations already contemplate the use of new technologies by issuers and intermediaries, but I have asked the staff to consider whether amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules and regulations would be better suited to provide needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries who seek to administer on-chain financial systems.</p>
<p>While the Commission and its staff work to propose fit-for-purpose rules of the road for on-chain financial markets, I have directed the staff to consider a conditional exemptive relief framework or &ldquo;innovation exemption&rdquo; that would expeditiously allow registrants and non-registrants to bring on-chain products and services to market. An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump&rsquo;s vision to make America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the planet&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with to certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the discussions to follow.</p>
