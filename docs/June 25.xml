<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Federal bank regulatory agencies today released the 2025 list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where certain bank activities are eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit.</p>
<p>Under the CRA, the agencies assess a bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The list released by the agencies includes distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where revitalization or stabilization activities are eligible to receive CRA consideration. The designations reflect local economic conditions, including unemployment, poverty, and population changes. Previous years' lists and criteria for designating these areas are available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/data/cra/distressed">here</a>.</p>
<p>Revitalization or stabilization activities in these geographies are eligible to receive CRA consideration under the community development definition for 12 months after publication of the current list. As with past lists, the agencies apply a one-year lag period for geographies that were included in 2024 but are no longer designated as distressed or underserved in the current list.</p>
<p>The agencies leveraged an updated methodology to designate underserved middle-income census tracts for this list, based upon revised source information from various agencies. As a result, the amended urban influence codes use similar criteria and methods as previous delineations but have been consolidated from 12 to 9 categories. Additional information is available in the Source Information and Methodology.</p>

<title>Acting Comptroller Of The US Currency Issues Statement On Proposal To Modify The Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acting-comptroller-of-the-us-currency-issues-statement-on-proposal-to-modify-the-2025625/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood issued the following statement today following his approval of an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly support the notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the leverage ratio standard applicable to the largest and most systemically important banking organizations. The proposal would better tailor our capital requirements for banks to ensure the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio functions as a true backstop&mdash;not a primary constraint that limits lending unnecessarily. The proposal aligns with my commitment that the capital framework should support resilience but does not constrain growth.</p>
<p>The proposal would reduce tier 1 capital for depository institution subsidiaries of global systemically important bank holding companies (GSIBs) to allow for more efficient allocation of capital throughout a banking organization, while ensuring that the amount of overall capital that banking organizations maintain would not materially change. Overall, the proposal would provide the largest and most systemically important banking organizations significant flexibility and capacity to engage in low-risk, low-return activities. Additionally, the proposal is expected to support increased lending and economic activity. This increased competition in lending and capital markets could lead to more favorable terms for consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>The proposal would rely on a GSIB&rsquo;s risk profile to set the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for both the bank holding company and its depository institution subsidiary. The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s GSIB surcharge framework takes into consideration the size, complexity, and interconnectedness of the banking organization as a whole. Using the GSIB&rsquo;s risk profile would provide tailoring of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard. Instead of a one-size-fits all add-on, the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standard would range from 3.5 percent to 4.25 percent depending on a banking organization&rsquo;s risk profile. This would be lower than the current 5 percent standard at the holding company and 6 percent standard at the depository institution.</p>
<p>Additionally, for covered depository institutions, the proposal would modify the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio to be a buffer standard instead of the well-capitalized threshold under the prompt corrective action framework. This will provide flexibility to covered depository institutions as the buffer will serve as an &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; threshold instead of triggering automatic limitations under the prompt corrective action framework. In addition, a buffer approach may have less pro-cyclical effects because a banking organization may choose to use its buffer during times of economic stress, which could lessen the likelihood that the banking organization would reduce lending and other activities during such times.</p>
<p>This proposal will not only reduce burden but will also help promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets. The proposed modifications would help ensure that the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards generally serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements rather than as a regularly binding constraint.</p>
<p>I support the issuance of the NPR and encourage all stakeholders to submit comments on the proposal. We will carefully review and consider all comments. Additionally, I will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to calibrate regulatory requirements to be effective, not excessive, while ensuring the safety, soundness and fairness of the federal banking system.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) today announced that&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://cvent.me/vyN3dw" target="_blank">registration is now open</a>&nbsp;for the 2025 Joint Compliance Outreach Program, a two-day event to discuss compliance and regulatory matters directly with municipal market professionals. The program will be held virtually via Zoom on November 18 and 19.</p>
<p>The event gives market professionals the opportunity to share perspectives on how firms are evolving and responding to business, regulatory, and technology matters. This year&rsquo;s program provides practical and tailored discussions addressing top concerns and interests among municipal securities dealers and municipal advisors, including conflicts of interest, broker-dealer primary offering and pricing practices, compliance concerns, and other key municipal market topics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Compliance Outreach Program is dedicated to discussing regulatory challenges in the municipal securities market,&rdquo; said Dave Sanchez, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Municipal Securities. &ldquo;Interacting with panelists and members of the public on compliance concerns and emerging issues helps regulators create a more efficient regulatory environment for the municipal securities industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look forward to hearing from dealers and municipal advisors about opportunities and challenges in meeting their regulatory obligations in the evolving municipal securities market,&rdquo; said MSRB Chief Regulatory and Policy Officer Ernesto Lanza. &ldquo;Insights from this program will inform our retrospective rule review, which is an ongoing assessment of our rules to modernize requirements, reduce undue burdens and facilitate innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Compliance Outreach Program fosters essential dialogue between regulators and municipal securities firms,&rdquo; said Michael Solomon, Executive Vice President of Examinations and Membership Application Program at FINRA<span><span><span>.</span></span></span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are pleased to partner with the SEC and MSRB to offer meaningful conversations where municipal market professionals not only hear from their regulators but also work with them to advance this crucial market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Municipal market professionals can submit questions and topics of interest in advance of the event by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sessionquestions@finra.org">sessionquestions@finra.org</a>. A recording of the event will be archived for later viewing on the SEC website.</p>

<p>Today, the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) released its annual&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ciro.ca/sites/default/files/2025-06/CIRO-Enforcement-Report-2025.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">Enforcement Report</a>&nbsp;highlighting the previous year&rsquo;s enforcement activities which include complaint intake, investigations and proceedings against dealers and approved persons who have contravened CIRO regulations.</p>
<p>Enforcement is a key lever in deterring potential harmful conduct and sending strong regulatory messages to the industry. The report aims to bring transparency to CIRO&rsquo;s Enforcement actions by gathering together all CIRO proceedings from the previous year and showcasing the contraventions involved and the sanctions that were imposed.</p>
<p>The report also showcases case highlights and key statistics about the activities of the Enforcement department and the kinds of complaints, investigations and cases CIRO has encountered in the past year. It provides visualization of the trends in regulatory violations, complaint sources, and the pan-Canadian coverage of both investigations and proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 2025 fiscal year, Enforcement identified and pursued cases with significant deterrent impact and sent a strong regulatory message to the industry about the consequences for violating regulations,&rdquo; said Alexandra Williams, Senior Vice-President, Strategy, Innovation and Stakeholder Protection. &ldquo;The team continues to harmonize and create efficiencies that will help us tackle financial crimes, wrongdoing and increased complaints and inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since its founding, CIRO has been committed to regulatory evolution and harmonization.</p>
<p>Highlights from the 2024-2025 Enforcement Report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed 4,127 complaints received from sources including the public, whistleblowers, ComSet/METS, commissions and other regulators, and internal CIRO departments such as Surveillance, Compliance and Member Registration.</li>
<li>Conducted 176 investigations with 34% referred for prosecution.</li>
<li>Completed 57 enforcement proceedings.</li>
<li>Imposed $10,313,381 in fines, costs and disgorgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant achievements in the past year also include transforming the event reporting system used by mutual fund dealers to ComSet. Enforcement transitioned to a single document management system and a single case management system, harmonizing legacy interfaces. The team launched a new E-Discovery and Evidence team, increasing the capabilities and resources of the Enforcement department.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA75-117376770-460_Report_on_the_functioning_and_review_of_the_DLTR_-_Art.14.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">report</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;on the Distributed Ledger Technology Pilot Regime (DLT Pilot Regime), providing an overview of the EU market for authorised DLT market infrastructures and recommendations on how to expand participation in the Regime.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The report contains information about business models, types of DLT financial instruments offered, and technical or legal issues encountered by supervisors to date. It also analyses the types of exemptions requested by DLT market infrastructures and the conditions under which National Competent Authorities (NCA&rsquo;s) have granted those exemptions (including the compensatory measures imposed to mitigate risks).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This report comes at an inflection point for the DLT Pilot Regime, which, despite an initially limited uptake, is now seeing growing interest from potential applicants. This recent momentum confirms the relevance of continued efforts to enhance the regime&rsquo;s attractiveness and functionality.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">To build on this momentum, ESMA presents strategic recommendations to the European Commission (EC), prepared with feedback received by NCAs and the European Central Bank (ECB), about:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">how to make the DLT Pilot Regime more attractive to the market, and</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">suggested amendments to the Pilot Regime to make it permanent and allow for more flexibility in the regulatory thresholds or eligible assets depending on the risks of each business model.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">These recommendations will complement the EC&rsquo;s public consultation on the DLT Pilot Regime for market stakeholders, which is part of the wider consultation on the Savings and Investments Union (SIU).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Next Steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The EC is<span>&nbsp;</span>expected to present its own report to the European Parliament and Council within three months of receipt of the ESMA Report.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Depending on the EC&rsquo;s recommendations, the DLT Pilot Regime may be extended, amended, or converted into a permanent regulation. If the regime is extended, ESMA would be prepared to provide a follow-up report within the revised timeline and to continue technical engagement with all stakeholders.</span></p>

<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The briefing, developed by ESMA's CCP Resolution Committee, provides a methodology to be considered by NRAs when including the resolution cash call in CCP resolution plans.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">NRAs should define the relevant data to be collected by the CCP, with a view to calibrate the resources available through a cash call. In doing so, NRAs should take into account the impact on relevant stakeholders, such as clearing members, financial markets and financial market infrastructures. Finally, NRAs should ensure that appropriate processes are in place for executing the cash calls, and that their effectiveness is tested through dry-runs.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">This briefing supports NRAs in enhancing their preparedness for implementing a resolution cash call.

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://click-783105.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=643025&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4515587&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.exegy.com%2F&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=527f43e1b5610330d904e4ea41b6ea943cc4e23146431d00e8c58ff6417a967c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Exegy</a>, a leading provider of market data, trading technology and managed services for the capital markets, today announced the launch of&nbsp;<strong>Nexus</strong>, a breakthrough market data platform that eliminates the long-standing trade-offs between performance, scale, and cost.&nbsp;Built to meet the demands of today&rsquo;s high-volume, high-volatility trading environments, Nexus replaces fragmented, server-heavy feed handler deployments with efficient FPGA-based appliances and network interface cards. Nexus delivers consistent low-single-digit microsecond performance, consumes a single CPU core on client servers, and reduces datacenter footprint by more than 40%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sustained volatility and high volumes present attractive trading opportunities to savvy firms with the strategies and moxie to capture them. Nexus offers them a transformative tool to conquer the unattractive compromises that they would otherwise have to make when building their trading platform,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>David Taylor, CEO at Exegy.</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;With Nexus, we leveraged our proven FPGA expertise to fundamentally reimagine market data processing along the full data path from raw tick to executed trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Key Features and Benefits of Nexus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistent Speed:&nbsp;</strong>Market data is delivered to software applications in ~2 microseconds, enabling trading strategies to react in under 3 microseconds with extremely low jitter</li>
<li><strong>Future-proof Capacity:&nbsp;</strong>Market data is processed at line rate during a single hop through an FPGA while integrated Level 1 switching enables seamless scaling of appliances</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Efficiency:&nbsp;</strong>Client servers allocate a single CPU core to consume normalized market data from an appliance that processes all feeds in a datacenter</li>
<li><strong>Dramatic Cost Savings:&nbsp;</strong>Over 40% reductions in operating costs are achievable with lower datacenter footprint</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Managed Services:&nbsp;</strong>FPGA-based appliances are fully managed, monitored, and updated by a global team of experts</li>
<li><strong>Tick-to-Trade Integration:&nbsp;</strong>Seamless integration with FPGA tick-to-trade platform enables ultra-low latency strategies to respond to aggregated market data from multiple markets in under 350 nanoseconds</li>
</ul>
<p>In a return on investment analysis with a U.S. equities broker, Nexus delivered&nbsp;<strong>up to</strong>&nbsp;<strong>41% in infrastructure savings</strong>. Replacing traditional, software-based deployments with a managed FPGA-based Nexus appliance reduced server count from 32 to 22, cutting operational costs by&nbsp;<strong>36%</strong>, saving an estimated&nbsp;<strong>$1.4 million annually</strong>&nbsp;<strong>per site</strong>. When paired with Nexus SmartNICs to offload the API layer, server count dropped to 17, delivering close to&nbsp;<strong>$2</strong>&nbsp;<strong>million in annual savings</strong>, improved determinism, eliminated jitter, and reduced overall system complexity.</p>
<p>Beyond market data normalization and distribution, Nexus integrates seamlessly into the broader trading stack, supporting both application-level consumption and execution workflows. It is fully compatible with Exegy&rsquo;s tick-to-trade and execution solutions,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://click-783105.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=643025&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4515587&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.exegy.com%2Fproducts%2Fsrex%2F&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=bbd543840a5c5b447e31551f055831e7268290fbd9c264e9b54fd362f1fb55bb" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SREX</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://click-783105.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=643025&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4515587&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enyx.com%2Fnxaccess%2F%3F__hstc%3D180155771.f2c229e94f4bcba26bd6604e34f8ebfc.1750259857458.1750700576299.1750710201013.3%26__hssc%3D180155771.1.1750710201013%26__hsfp%3D3892574149&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=98727f31324b44104db071babd9053a4ef846882b6cb611aed03b0c76db12634" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nxAccess</a>, enabling firms to build cohesive, high-performance trading infrastructures.</p>
<p>For market makers and Smart Order Routers, Nexus also simplifies the deployment of large-scale FPGA environments. The platform delivers raw and normalized market data directly to FPGAs, enabling ultra-fast order routing to co-located exchanges or signal transmission to remote data centers over wireless networks. Initial deployments focus on equities and futures, with support for additional asset classes and features&mdash;such as fast-cancel or sweeping logic for agency brokers&mdash;planned for future releases.</p>
<p><strong>Nexus is the result of an innovative effort to rethink how market data infrastructure should work in today&rsquo;s trading environment.</strong>&nbsp;Through extensive engagement with agency brokers, hedge funds, and market makers across the buy- and sell-side, Exegy validated core challenges&mdash;then pushed beyond them. The result is a platform shaped by industry insight but driven by Exegy&rsquo;s vision for scalable, next-generation market data delivery and proven expertise in harnessing FPGA technology to solve the most challenging performance problems in capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most firms still rely on disconnected systems to manage different market data workflows,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Laurent de Barry</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>VP, Ultra-Low Latency Trading Products at Exegy</strong>. &ldquo;This leads to unnecessary complexity, duplicated costs, and limited scalability. Instead of relying on traditional, server-heavy deployments, Nexus consolidates data infrastructure needs into a single, efficient, FPGA-powered platform that supports global market visibility. This gives a centralized, scalable delivery of market data with fewer servers, less power consumption and lower costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Nexus is now available for order</strong>, with production delivery scheduled for&nbsp;<strong>early Q4 2025</strong>. Early adopter clients have access to an integration environment that enables application development and testing with the production API. The appliance is delivered as a fully managed service, including deployment, monitoring, and support.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>CUR8 unveils CUR8 Plan - a &lsquo;virtual carbon removal scientist&rsquo;, empowering corporate sustainability teams to build their carbon removal strategies, while eliminating the complexity, risk and access issues of the carbon removal market.</li>
<li>Through the publicly available CUR8 Plan, CUR8 is bringing top tier carbon removal scientific expertise to every company in the world. Saving sustainability teams time and money - whilst giving CFOs confidence in the commercial impact of delivering lower carbon emissions.</li>
<li>CUR8 Plan draws on data from over 1,000 global&nbsp;projects across 99+ countries &ndash; offering corporates a simplified route to customisable carbon removal strategies.</li>
<li>
<div>Launched during London Climate Action Week, CUR8 Plan complements the company&rsquo;s growing customer base, which include British Airways, Coca-Cola HBC and Standard Chartered.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CUR8, the market maker for carbon removals, today launched CUR8 Plan, the publicly available, expert-powered planning and strategy software that puts a world-class carbon removal scientist in every sustainability team. The product helps companies to overcome the complexity of integrating carbon removals into their sustainability strategies. CUR8 Plan replaces the need for expensive consultants or in-house experts, and was unveiled to industry and customers at CUR8&rsquo;s London Climate Action Week event held in central London on Monday 23 June.</p>
<p>Despite more than 10,000 companies worldwide committing to SBTi targets, just over 200 are actually buying carbon removals. Today, sustainability teams at companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Shopify need to build large in-house specialist teams or hire consultants to get up the carbon removal knowledge curve and have confidence in their decisions. Faced with a maze of over 20 removal methods covering 1,000+ projects &ndash; each with different standards, quality metrics and unreliable data - teams need specialist carbon removal expertise that few can afford.</p>
<p>CUR8 Plan changes this. Built on CUR8&rsquo;s Carbon Removal Intelligence Platform, it arms sustainability, procurement, and finance teams with the data, specialist scientific expertise, and AI powered tooling to translate climate ambition into a practical carbon removal strategy. CUR8 Plan allows users to build alignment and confidence in their strategies through modelling budgets, delivery risks, and alignment to established frameworks such as the Oxford Offsetting Principles, SBTi and more.</p>
<p><b>Marta Krupinska</b>, Co-Founder and CEO of CUR8 said:</p>
<div class="elementToProof">&ldquo;Our goal is to increase confidence and trust in carbon removal among sustainability teams. By allowing them to play around with the data set we&rsquo;ve been carefully building over the last 2.5 years, create their own portfolios and explore our scientific analysis, we are allowing sustainability teams to save time and money in developing this know-how in-house. Finally, we hope that the ability to generate a personalised business case will make a huge difference to securing budgets for carbon removal and bringing more buyers into the market, faster.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
<div class="elementToProof">
<p>With a trillion-dollar carbon removals market taking shape, CUR8 Plan puts companies on the front foot. Corporates such as British Airways, Coca-Cola HBC, and Standard Chartered are already utilising CUR8&rsquo;s Intelligence Platform to discover, procure and manage high-quality carbon removals. Now with CUR8 Plan, this latest innovation further enhances CUR8&rsquo;s ability to help companies design actionable carbon removal strategies, as progress towards net zero goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fund reporting tools designed specifically for partnerships</li>
<li>Jurisdiction&nbsp;neutral</li>

</ul>
<p>Hedge fund technology platform Truss Edge has now&nbsp;added partnership accounting to its range of sophisticated reporting tools, part of&nbsp;a package that integrates and automates hedge fund management operations.<br /><br />Partnership tax reporting has been developed to assist fund managers with the&nbsp;reporting demands onshore partners structures require. The feature has been&nbsp;developed in coordination with hedge fund managers and can be adapted to the&nbsp;needs of any manager operating an onshore partnership structure, in the US or&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<h2 class="null">Investor-by-investor reporting</h2>
<p>Truss Edge&rsquo;s proprietary Safari technology can now provide granular investor-by-investor reporting and can be adapted to the needs of different structures. This&nbsp;provides the ability to segregate P&amp;L and characterise individual elements of&nbsp;taxable and non-taxable income from the fund.<br /><br />&ldquo;The addition of this feature removes the need to run a separate accounting&nbsp;system alongside your core portfolio management activity,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Dave Shastri</strong>,&nbsp;CEO of Truss Edge. &ldquo;We now provide our clients with full visibility and reporting&nbsp;on the partnership tax flow-through. For firms which don&rsquo;t have an efficient tax&nbsp;reporting system in place, this can provide a much more integrated solution,&nbsp;saving time and streamlining workflow.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Raj Shah</strong>, CEO of fund manager Meridian Partners LLP, which is already using&nbsp;this feature, also commented:<br /><br />&ldquo;We have found the new partner reporting feature in Safari to be a very valuable&nbsp;addition.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Advisory Committee on Sustainability Reporting (ACSR), chaired by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), today published a consultation paper to seek public feedback on the proposed framework for sustainability assurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirement for external assurance on sustainability reporting is necessary to ensure the reliability of disclosures by companies scoped-in under the National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The consultation paper on the proposed framework discusses, among others, the adoption of international sustainability assurance standards, oversight of assurance providers, competency requirements for assurance leaders and timelines for external assurance.</p>
<p>Feedback is sought from a broad range of stakeholders to ensure that the framework is practical, credible and sufficiently robust.</p>
<p>A robust sustainability assurance framework is essential to address concerns on greenwashing and to promote investor confidence in the sustainable reports issued by companies.</p>
<p>The public consultation period is from 25 June 2025 to 6 August 2025.</p>
<p>The consultation  paper  is available online  at <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">-</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">papers</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/regulation/consultation-papers">.</a></p>

<p><span>big xyt, the independent provider of market analytics and data solutions, has announced its withdrawal from the bidding process to become the European Consolidated Tape Provider (CTP) for Equities and ETFs.</span><br /><br /><span>Following in-depth engagement with key industry stakeholders and a comprehensive internal review, the company concluded that the level of financial support required to proceed was not achieved.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;From the outset, our involvement in the CTP process was driven by a clear request from the industry to provide an independent, high-quality alternative,&rdquo; said Robin Mess, CEO of big xyt. &ldquo;While we had not originally planned to enter the race, we stepped up late in the process in response to concerns about competition, governance and data quality.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>big xyt&rsquo;s broader mission &mdash; to improve transparency and accessibility in financial markets &mdash; remains unchanged. The company built its own consolidated view of European markets to power its analytics platform and understands first-hand the value such a capability brings to the ecosystem.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Our proposal was shaped by a belief that the CTP should serve the entire industry &mdash; with robust governance, a focus on data quality and independence at its core,&rdquo; said Mess. &ldquo;However, this vision requires strong, coordinated support across market participants, which could not be secured at this time.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>While big xyt is stepping back from the CTP process, it remains committed to its mission of delivering transparent and trusted analytics solutions to its clients globally.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are proud of our role in advancing the discussion, and we stand ready to support any initiative that promotes fairness, transparency and innovation in European capital markets,&rdquo; added Mess.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>ESMA has received formal notification as the withdrawal takes effect immediately.</span></p>

<title>UK VC Funding Deal Volume And Value Down By 13% And 14% YoY During January-May 2025, Finds GlobalData</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-vc-funding-deal-volume-and-value-down-by-13-and-14-yoy-during-january-may-2-2025625/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The venture capital (VC) funding landscape in the UK has experienced a year-on-year (YoY) decline in both deal volume and value during the first five months of 2025. VC deal volume declined around 13%, mirroring a broader contraction in global VC activity, which saw a reduction of around 6% in deal volume. Deal value declined about 14% YoY. This drop is particularly striking when juxtaposed with the global landscape, where total VC funding value surged by around 39%, reveals&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyI46DndO6wveoWg-2FCWKH6nQ5rj-2FwHu04zxa6MFjJRsMjr-2BRtW4OUe875wa-2B91MtOxXdVh9_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7Cv6B-2F2GiY-2FAgNMLjTAC4KRxvw1gZNJwW-2FnOTphBupEDkwfoGqWa-2FAzxKL7rZEMOP-2BceuGIBuAcn4OHV8WBi8W07TWqjPXMMIr5Pm5BAfDdPXnMUpShBA38HqRHkWqiQnYkKnYFEGqjrOGhM1wZXsgcA0BX1jltWWM-2FpaqDiecJRpzK2YZuNg1paH3r-2B3HllUh1gmEIDZxs24QH3XjPOeifS1ncp6EjuVRC235TU0HYW8-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;While the decline in value contrasts with the global trend, it is essential to recognize that the trend may not be as challenging as the data shows.

<p><span><span>In fact, even though the UK is yet to see announcement of any billion-dollar VC deal in 2025 so far, it is noteworthy that the country experienced an YoY upward trend in terms of total deal value when only the first four months of 2025 and 2024 are taken into consideration.

This allows consumers to proactively adjust their driving habits, reinforcing safer behaviour on the road.</p>
<p>By utilising analysed driving patterns, the Kia App, will offer tailored driving coaching tips, giving consumers the ability to change their driving behaviour and to potentially lower their insurance costs and improve vehicle efficiency. Through their relationships with Kia Connect, participating insurers will also be able to incorporate the driving scores into pricing models, offering consumers more personalised insurance rates based on actual driving behaviour.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to collaborate with Kia Connect on this important endeavour to help Kia owners proactively lower their cost of vehicle ownership. By embracing the use of their driving behaviour data, Kia owners can improve their driving behaviour. Additionally, Kia owners will have the option to share the scores with their insurer to personalise their insurance premium," said James Burton, managing director, Europe and U.K. insurance, LexisNexis Risk Solutions. "Leveraging a scoring service that utilises our Drive Metrics model, automakers are better positioned to support their owners and insurers with more accurate segmentation based on actual driving risks and enable more personalised pricing of policy premiums."</p>
<p><b>Addressing Key Automotive and Insurance Industry Challenges<br /></b>Automakers and insurers alike face several challenges in leveraging connected car data effectively, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Data Quality and Standardisation:&nbsp;</b>Connected car data often lacks uniform formatting, making it difficult for insurers to integrate into underwriting practices. LexisNexis Risk Solutions addresses this by normalising and standardising Kia Connect's anonymised driving data for insurer-ready insights.</li>
<li><b>Regulatory Compliance:</b>&nbsp;With important data privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is crucial to ensure that consumer personal data is processed and handled with full transparency. The Kia App enables consumers to provide consent to Kia before their personal data is collected, ensuring a privacy-first approach.</li>
<li><b>Cost Reduction and Customer Engagement:</b>&nbsp;Leveraging the insights from Drive Metrics can help consumers manage expenses by promoting better driving behaviours that could lead to lower insurance premiums and long-term cost savings. Kia Europe also benefits from deeper customer and brand engagement by integrating these insights into its app.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Benefits for Consumers, Insurers and Automakers<br /></b>Kia Europe's high app adoption and usage rate ensures that partnered insurers gain access to interested, engaged segments of the population without the cost and complexity of maintaining their own usage-based insurance (UBI) programmes. This can give insurers a competitive edge by improving risk segmentation, offering more personalised pricing and enhancing customer retention.</p>
<p>"Connected services are reshaping the driver experience, and by utilising the LexisNexis Risk Solutions scoring service that integrates driving insights from the LexisNexis Drive Metrics model into our Kia Connect platform, we're taking the next step in offering smarter, safer driving, and more personalised mobility," said Olivier Pascal, head of connected cars, Kia Connect. "This collaboration empowers our customers with real-time driving insights while supporting the insurance industry with meaningful, privacy-conscious data to deliver tailored insurance solutions. It's a win for our drivers&mdash;and for the future of connected mobility."</p>
<p>"Automakers and insurers continue to evolve how they engage with consumers, with connected vehicle data emerging as a powerful differentiator," said Karsten Crede of Mobility Insurance Network. "In a market where customer expectations around personalisation, transparency and cost-efficiency are rising sharply&mdash;especially among EV owners&mdash;those who can translate driving behaviour into actionable insights will lead."</p>
<p><b>Future Innovation and Expansion<br /></b>This initiative marks just the beginning of a broader movement toward data-driven risk assessment in the automotive and insurance industries. As vehicles continue to become more connected, LexisNexis Risk Solutions remains committed to evolving risk-based solutions that help insurers, automakers and consumers navigate the future of mobility. LexisNexis Risk Solutions scoring as a service is a demonstration of this ongoing commitment to innovation and offering dynamic solutions across multiple markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>PT Bank&nbsp;Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk, (IDX: BBRI)</b>&nbsp;has officially issued its first Sustainable Social Bond Phase I Year 2025, valued at IDR 5 trillion. The issuance received strong interest with an oversubscription of IDR 6.57 trillion&mdash;1.31 times the initial target.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg4683left"><img align="middle" alt="BRI President Director Hery Gunardi speaks at the signing of BRI&rsquo;s Phase 1 Sustainable Bond Agreement" id="prnejpg4683left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2718525/BRI_President_Director_Hery_Gunardi_speaks_signing_BRI_s_Phase_1.jpg" title="BRI President Director Hery Gunardi speaks at the signing of BRI&rsquo;s Phase 1 Sustainable Bond Agreement" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bond is part of BRI's Sustainable Public Offering Program I, which aims to raise a total of IDR 20 trillion. With this issuance, BRI becomes the first bank in Indonesia to issue a Social Bond.</p>
<p>The agreement signing was attended by BRI President Director Hery Gunardi, Director of Treasury &amp; International Banking Farida Thamrin, Director of Operations Hakim Putratama, joint lead underwriters, and supporting institutions.</p>
<p>BRI President Director Hery Gunardi explained that the bank's decision to issue a Social Bond stems from the limited availability of socially focused securities instruments in Indonesia. "This also serves as concrete proof of BRI's commitment to maintaining ESG-oriented financing," said Hery.</p>
<p>He further stated that the Social Bond issuance is aligned with the bank's strategy to strengthen its funding structure through the diversification of wholesale-based funding sources. "This move also serves as part of the company's strategy to broaden access to more competitive and sustainable capital markets," he added.</p>
<p>The bond has received a Triple A (idAAA) rating from the Indonesian credit rating agency PEFINDO and is offered in three series:</p>
<p>Series A: 2-year tenor with a fixed interest rate of 6.45% per annum</p>
<p>Series B: 3-year tenor with a fixed interest rate of 6.55% per annum</p>
<p>Series C: 5-year tenor with a fixed interest rate of 6.60% per annum</p>
<p>Issued through a bookbuilding process, the bond involves prominent underwriters including PT BRI Danareksa Sekuritas, PT Trimegah Sekuritas Indonesia Tbk, PT Mandiri Sekuritas, PT DBS Vickers Sekuritas Indonesia, PT Indo Premier Sekuritas, and PT Bahana Sekuritas. The Social Framework was developed with ESG Coordinator Bank DBS Indonesia.</p>
<p>The bond will be listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and registered with KSEI. Coupon payments will be made quarterly, with a full principal repayment (bullet payment) at maturity.</p>
<p>Hery concluded that this issuance reinforces BRI's commitment to expanding financial inclusion and empowering communities through sustainable financing.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX Limited Chair David Clarke welcomes Anne Loveridge AM as a new non-executive director and confirms changes to the Board Committee structure to further strengthen directors&rsquo; focus on risk management.</p>
<p>Ms Loveridge will join the ASX Limited Board on 1 July 2025 and will stand for election at ASX&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting on 23 October 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Loveridge brings more than four decades of experience across financial services, governance, audit and risk management. Having served 30 years at PwC where she held several leadership positions including serving as Deputy Chair of its Board of Partners, Ms Loveridge has also enjoyed a highly distinguished non-executive career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She has deep board experience within financial services organisations and is currently a non-executive director at Platinum Asset Management and HSBC Australia. Prior to this she served on the Board of National Australia Bank for nine years.</p>
<p>Mr Clarke said: &ldquo;Anne has a distinguished track record as a director and senior executive in financial and professional services, and I&rsquo;m delighted to welcome someone of her calibre to the ASX Board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having made significant contributions through her work on audit, risk, remuneration, and sustainability committees, I&rsquo;m confident we will benefit from Anne&rsquo;s deep understanding of regulatory environments and stakeholder management. I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with her to strengthen ASX&rsquo;s position as a world-class exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Clarke noted that as Chair he was focused on ensuring there was the appropriate blend of skills and experience on the Board: &ldquo;This is an ongoing priority for me as we manage the natural cadence of director succession and Board renewal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melinda Conrad is completing her final term as director having joined in August 2016 and served as the Chair of the People and Culture Committee since 2023. She will retire on 15 August 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter Nash has also signalled his intention to retire having served on the ASX Board since June 2019 and chaired the Audit and Risk Committee since 2021. He will stay to oversee the completion of ASX&rsquo;s FY25 financial reporting process in August and will retire at the conclusion of the September Board meeting.</p>
<p>Mr Clarke recognised the valuable contribution from Mr Nash and Ms Conrad: &ldquo;I want to thank them for their outstanding service and contributions to ASX over many years, and through a period of very substantial change for the organisation. I&rsquo;m grateful for their wise counsel and support in the time I&rsquo;ve been Chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As ASX continues with its transformation strategy, the Board has been assessing how to further strengthen its oversight while managing for growing complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Clarke said: &ldquo;ASX must hold itself to the highest standards, and we&rsquo;ve been discussing as a Board how to best support the work under the risk transformation plan. To this end, we see benefit in separating the board Audit and Risk Committee into two distinct board committees. This should provide more dedicated focus by each committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the Risk Committee will include overseeing the risk transformation work led by the new Chief Risk Officer and the business resilience work being led by the Chief Operating Officer. The first Risk Committee met on 18 June 2025 and is chaired by Wayne Byres.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Audit and Supervision Committee will have a dedicated focus on corporate reporting and the activities and independence of both ASX&rsquo;s internal audit function and its external auditor, in addition to overseeing the supervisory role performed by ASX&rsquo;s Listings Compliance and Participants Compliance functions.</p>
<p>The Audit and Supervision Committee will be chaired by Mr Nash until his retirement from the ASX Limited Board, at which time Ms Loveridge will become Chair of the Committee. Upon Ms Conrad&rsquo;s retirement from the Board, Vicki Carter will become the Chair of the People and Culture Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the Risk Committee Charter and the Audit and Supervision Committee Charter are available on the ASX website.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>SET and partners launch the Refreshing SE for Growth program, aiming to empower social enterprises to scale up their businesses and create meaningful social impact alongside profitable operations.</li>
<li>18 SEs being SET Social Impact GYM alumni with solid business models and growth plans will participate in a three-day bootcamp, with the selected high-potential participants to receive one-on-one coaching from experts for four months.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) launched the Refreshing SE for Growth program in collaboration with mai Listed Company Association (maiA), PwC Thailand, Office of Social Enterprise Promotion (OSEP), Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation (TCG), and Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) to strengthen Thailand's social enterprise ecosystem by providing advanced capacity-building support to high-potential SEs that are SET Social Impact GYM alumni, and equipping them with critical business expansion skills.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Rongrak</b><b> </b><b>Phanapavudhikul</b> emphasized SET&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to supporting SEs as key drivers of Thailand&rsquo;s social and environmental advancement. Over the past eight years (2017-2024), SET, maiA, and partner organizations in both the public and private sectors jointly strengthened the SE ecosystem by providing various incubation and capability development programs to support more than 90 SEs, empowering them to actively create positive changes. These SEs have generated measurable social impact by creating employment opportunities for 114,000 vulnerable individuals, farmers and community members; providing educational opportunities to over 8,000 people; offering healthcare services to more than 6,000 beneficiaries; and implementing environmental initiatives benefiting over 110,000 community members. While various SEs have demonstrated strong growth potential, they still require experts&rsquo; guidance to systematically and properly strategize and scale their businesses in order to achieve greater success.</p>
<p>Therefore, SET has arranged the Refreshing SE for Growth program, which will run from June to November 2025, to accelerate business expansion among high-potential SEs. In this connection, 18 selected SEs, being SET Social Impact GYM alumni with solid business models and expansion plans, will participate in this program, which is divided into two modules as follows:</p>
<p><b>Module 1 - Intensive Upskills for Growth:</b> a three-day intensive workshop focusing on business expansion and growth strategy planning, product development, financial planning, and fundamental preparation for joint investments.</p>
<p><b>Module 2 - Business Support:</b> high-potential participants with solid business models and expansion plans, selected from the 1<sup>st</sup> module, will receive one-on-one coaching from experts for four months, with in-depth guidance and consultation on business expansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SET aims to develop entrepreneurial excellence among SEs, unlocking their full potential and positioning them as robust role models, capable of expanding both their business and meaningful social impact for the country&rsquo;s sustainable advancement,&rdquo; added Rongrak.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Capital Markets Gain Fresh Momentum From Innovation And Connectivity Drives: Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Annual Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vibrant market innovation and enhanced global connectivity fuelled notable strides for Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets over the past year with an upturn in fund-raising and trading activities, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Annual-Report/2024-25/SFC-Annual-Report-2024-25_Eng_final.pdf?rev=21e0632e39b5454cb440901a9adb0f93" target="_blank"><em>Annual Report 2024-25</em></a>&nbsp;of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released today.</p>
<p>The city has been fast evolving into a future-ready financial hub through accelerated developments in virtual assets and securities tokenisation over the past year. Meanwhile, on the back of reform measures introduced in the recent year, rebounds in IPOs and secondary market trading have catapulted Hong Kong into the world&rsquo;s top fund-raising platform. Ties with the Mainland and international markets have also been strengthened as well amidst a complex global landscape.</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chairman Dr Kelvin Wong said: &ldquo;Our role as an effective regulator is to ensure Hong Kong remains a cornerstone of global finance, where capital flows efficiently, innovation thrives and fairness builds trust. As we navigate unprecedented global challenges, regulatory agility, perfect foresight and proactive engagement are crucial to facilitating market development and ensuring our capital markets serve Hong Kong&rsquo;s long-term economic interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer Ms Julia Leung said: &ldquo;Building on the solid foundation of market resilience, Hong Kong&rsquo;s long-term success also hinges on our proactive growth strategies: strengthening our core competence as a premier fund-raising and asset management hub and capitalising on the transformative forces of the world to drive sustained growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the innovation front, the SFC authorised the Asia-Pacific&rsquo;s first batch of three tokenised money market funds for retail access last quarter, marking a step forward in scaling the tokenisation market (Note 1). The funds had total assets under management (AUM) of $736 million as of end-March (Note 2).</p>
<p>To develop Hong Kong&rsquo;s virtual asset (VA) ecosystem under the &ldquo;ASPIRe&rdquo; roadmap issued earlier this year, the SFC has subsequently allowed two VA ETFs to engage in staking, marking Asia-Pacific&rsquo;s first such ETFs (Note 3). Meanwhile, the total market capitalisation of six Hong Kong-listed VA spot ETFs had surged 95% and daily turnover risen 16% since their debut last April. For VA trading platforms, the SFC has licensed a total of 11.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as Asia&rsquo;s premier capital intermediary was also reinforced through new ties with the Middle East. The two Hong Kong ETFs cross-listed on the Saudi Exchange are the largest ETFs there, with a market capitalisation of $14.5 billion (US$1.86 billion) as of May. For Asia&rsquo;s first Saudi ETF listed in Hong Kong since late 2023, its feeder ETFs cross-listed on Mainland exchanges since mid-2024 now contribute 17% to the master ETF&rsquo;s market capitalisation.</p>
<p>For Mainland-Hong Kong connectivity, the cumulative southbound inflows of the Stock Connect scheme surpassed $4.35 trillion as of May. The share of southbound trading also increased to 22.5% of Hong Kong&rsquo;s market turnover.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy highlights for the financial year 2024-25:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SFC worked with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to enhance the listing application timeframe. Since its launch, the SFC&rsquo;s average response time for new listing applications has been within 20 business days (Note 4).</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong Kong&rsquo;s IPO activity has turned vibrant since the Mainland announced supportive measures in April 2024, with a total of 64 Mainland enterprises, including leading companies, listing in the city since the announcement. During the year, IPO funds raised surpassed $100 billion.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total market capitalisation of ETFs and leveraged and inverse (L&amp;I) products in Hong Kong surged 35% year-on-year (YoY) to $520 billion, a record high, with their share of total Hong Kong market turnover reaching 15%. The introduction of single-stock L&amp;I products in 2025 further enhances product diversity.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of SFC-approved licence applications jumped 20% YoY. Corporate licence applications received by the SFC also increased by a similar percentage.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a landmark ruling, Hong Kong&rsquo;s High Court imposed the longest prison sentences for a market manipulation case under the Securities and Futures Ordinance. In another case of corporate misconduct, the SFC secured a historic settlement to compensate shareholders of Combest Holdings Limited.</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To boost anti-scam awareness, the SFC extended the publicity of its &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be Sucker&rdquo; campaign through MTR station commercials and a TV infotainment programme, which is estimated to have garnered more than 1.6 million views.&nbsp;</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support its sustainable development, the SFC halved its total carbon emissions from the baseline, thus reaching its interim target five years early (Note 5).</p>
<p>The Annual Report, accompanied by&nbsp;<a href="https://sfchk-video.s3.amazonaws.com/SFC+annual+report+2025_Eng.mp4" target="_blank">a video message</a>, is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Published-resources/Corporate-publications/Annual-reports" target="_blank">SFC website</a>, and its Facebook, LinkedIn and WeChat pages.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>These include the introduction of tokenised classes to existing SFC-authorised money market funds. The AUM represents that of their tokenised classes.</li>
<li>Unless otherwise specified, figures are in Hong Kong dollars and for the period from April 2024 to March 2025 or as of end-March 2025.</li>

<p align="left"><span><span>First-time buyers, the self-employed and people borrowing into retirement could benefit from further possible changes to mortgage rules. </span><span> </span><span><br /><br /></span></span><span>The FCA is seeking a public conversation on the future of the mortgage market as part of its work to help consumers navigate their financial lives and to support economic growth.</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Areas include: </span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Potential to update responsible lending rules to support wider access to sustainable home ownership. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Ensuring the regulatory framework and the market are prepared for the likely future increases in demand for later life lending. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Introducing more flexibility to promote consumer understanding, information needs, and innovation. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Rebalancing the collective risk appetite in mortgage lending. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><strong>David Geale, Executive Director for Payments and Digital Finance, said</strong><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;We want to evolve our mortgage rules to help more people access sustainable home ownership.</span><span> </span>&nbsp;<span>Having achieved higher standards in the market, now is the time to consider allowing more flexibility in a trusted market. </span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;Changing our mortgage rules could make it easier for people to get onto the property ladder and manage mortgages into retirement. </span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t solve all the issues related to home ownership. But we&rsquo;re playing our part in helping people better use the mortgage market to navigate their financial lives and to encourage a dynamic, innovative and competitive market.&rdquo; </span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The mortgage market has changed considerably over recent years. First time buyers are older and borrowing for longer, including into later life.&nbsp;</span><span>The FCA&rsquo;s data shows that in 2024, 68% of first-time buyers borrowed for terms of 30 years or longer.&nbsp;</span><span>Homeowners will also increasingly need to access their housing wealth to provide for their needs during retirement.</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>

<title>Opening Remarks, Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr: At A Fed Listens Event Hosted By The Federal Reserve Bank Of Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-federal-reserve-governor-michael-s-barr-at-a-fed-listens-even-2025624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Schmid, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for hosting this event.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250624a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;The Federal Reserve, with its system of 12 distinct regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., was designed to ensure that monetary policy was a national decision with input from all parts of the country. The work of the District Reserve Banks, and events like this one, make sure that a wide range of views can inform President Schmid, me, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, and all of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as we come together in Washington to set monetary policy.</p>
<p>Let me spend just a moment on the economy and the outlook. The economy is currently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation having continued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Looking forward, however, I expect inflation to rise due to tariffs. Higher short-term inflation expectations, supply chain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation persistence. At the same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise. There is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects. Monetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold.</p>
<p>The broad objectives of monetary policy are clear and have been mandated by Congress&mdash;maximum employment and stable prices. Our strategy for getting there is laid out in the Fed's policy framework, which we plan to update later this year. And setting that strategy to reach our goals is informed by outreach like the session today.</p>
<p>Monetary policy decisions affect everyone. Stable prices are important for families and businesses to be able to plan for the future, and for sustainable and healthy labor markets. When we get it right, we can help foster broad and inclusive employment gains that benefit the American people. Our decisions play a role, for example, in the prices for agricultural commodities that are particularly important for businesses and consumers in this region. These decisions affect the labor market, including the challenges that businesses can face in finding qualified workers, which I know is a bigger issue in Nebraska, with lower unemployment than in some other places. But the Federal Reserve's role is a limited one&mdash;most of what affects the economy are the individual decisions of households and businesses.</p>
<p>The primary tool for monetary policy is short-term interest rates, which in turn can affect longer-term rates that you, your customers, and people in your communities pay to finance land and equipment and other inputs. Credit has always played a particularly important role in agriculture, so I know that interest rates matter a lot in this part of America. Let me emphasize that real-world rates are significantly affected by other forces in the economy, but Fed policy does play a role.</p>
<p>Monetary policy sometimes requires tradeoffs&mdash;a stance of policy that is necessary to lower inflation, for example, may also lower aggregate demand and slow the economy. Crucial in balancing our economic goals is determining how policy decisions affect households and businesses, which is why we are here to listen to you.</p>
<p>Businesses also have to balance their goals. Producers need to judge the strength of demand for their products and services, the trend in costs for their inputs, and the expected future costs for credit. These and other factors affect how businesses see tradeoffs as they make decisions about expanding operations and hiring. Workers need to balance their prospects for their wages keeping up with inflation or whether it's worth moving to find a better job. Your experience, and the experiences of your customers and the other people you serve, is an important input into the strategy the Fed will decide on for our long-term monetary policy framework.</p>
<p>We are going to consider everything we've learned in the past five eventful years since we last updated our framework, and we have learned a lot. But we can't do it without you, because you are who we serve. And so, since listening requires that one stop talking, I am going to wrap up by thanking everyone from the Omaha area and across the 10th District for agreeing to be part of today's gathering. I look forward to hearing what you have to say.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />

<title>Statement On Jury’s Verdict In Trial Of Thomas F. Casey: Samuel Waldon, Acting Director, SEC Division Of Enforcement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, after a five-day trial and less than two hours of deliberation, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California found Thomas F. Casey liable for securities fraud.</p>
<p>Statement of SEC Division of Enforcement Acting Director Sam Waldon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the jury verdict holding the defendant liable for orchestrating a fraudulent securities offering, which targeted retirees&rsquo; retirement accounts with false promises of safety and security. The defendant induced more than 200 people to invest a total of over $10 million into Golden Genesis, a venture to supposedly create blood banks for selling human plasma from young donors for anti-aging treatments, based on false claims including that the investments would generate guaranteed high returns and be secured by the company&rsquo;s assets. In reality, the funds were not secured and the defendant used investor funds to compensate himself and to prop up the scheme by paying back other investors, causing approximately $8 million in losses to the victims. As this trial demonstrates, the SEC is committed to protecting retirees&rsquo; hard-earned savings and holding the perpetrators of frauds involving retirement funds accountable.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Monetary Policy: New Challenges - Speech By Philip R. Lane, Member Of The Executive Board Of The ECB, At The Barclays-CEPR Monetary Policy Forum 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the extraordinary inflation surges in 2021-2022, the primary challenge facing monetary policy has been to return inflation to target in a timely manner.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250624~6bc6bae5ac.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In terms of interest rate policy, this required a rapid hiking cycle from July 2022 to September 2023, followed by a &ldquo;hold at peak&rdquo; phase and then a gradual reversal of the restrictive stance starting in June 2024.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250624~6bc6bae5ac.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;The gradualism in the easing phase reflected ongoing uncertainty about the speed of the disinflation process.</p>
<p>While headline inflation is currently around the target, services inflation still has some distance to travel to make sure that inflation stabilises at the target on a sustainable basis. Still, there has been sufficient progress in returning inflation to target to consider that this monetary policy challenge is largely completed. This assessment is reinforced by the accumulating evidence that the remaining services disinflation is well on track: first, the projection errors for inflation, including for the services subcomponent, have been relatively small during the disinflation process; second, both the wage tracker data and survey indicators suggest that further deceleration in wage growth can be expected in both 2025 and 2026, facilitating further declines in services inflation.</p>
<p>However, this disinflation challenge has been superseded by a new set of challenges and monetary policymakers have to make sure that the medium-term inflation target is protected in a volatile environment in which, amongst other factors, there is high uncertainty about the future of long-standing international trade system.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250624~6bc6bae5ac.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This uncertainty extends beyond the calibration of new tariff regimes and includes the possibility of a broader set of non-tariff barriers, a deeper intertwining of economic policies and security policies and possible revisions to the treatment of foreign portfolio investors and foreign direct investors. In addition to policy uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, such as Russia&rsquo;s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty. Reflecting these developments, we have seen high volatility in energy prices this year and substantial currency repricing. There has also been considerable financial market volatility.</p>
<p>At the same time (and largely as an endogenous reaction to the changed security landscape), the fiscal outlook for the euro area has materially changed for the coming years, with the overall fiscal deficit looking set to remain above three per cent over the projection horizon. The near-term and medium-term implications for output and inflation of the structural changes associated with the green transition, the increasing business adoption of artificial intelligence applications and global shifts in comparative advantage are also highly uncertain, operating both on demand and supply with potentially different timelines.</p>
<p>Especially under current conditions of high uncertainty, it is essential to remain data dependent and take a meeting-by-meeting approach in making monetary policy decisions, with no pre-commitment to any particular future rate path. In addition to observing how activity and inflation are actually behaving, data dependence also extends to the incoming data on policy settings outside the monetary domain, since shifts in international and domestic policy regimes are highly relevant for future inflation dynamics. In this environment, the primary task for monetary policy makers is to make sure that any temporary deviations from target do not turn into longer-term deviations.</p>
<p>This orientation explains our June decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. The June projections were conditioned on a rate path that included a quarter-point reduction of the deposit facility rate (DFR) in June: model-based optimal policy simulations and an array of monetary policy feedback rules indicated a cut was appropriate under the baseline and also constituted a robust decision, remaining appropriate across a range of alternative future paths for inflation and the economy. By supporting the pricing pressure needed to generate target-consistent inflation in the medium-term, this cut helps ensure that the projected negative inflation deviation over the next eighteen months remains temporary and does not convert into a longer-term deviation of inflation from the target. This cut also guards against any uncertainty about our reaction function by demonstrating that we are determined to make sure that inflation returns to target in the medium term. This helps to underpin inflation expectations and avoid an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, in particular, that the robustness of the decision was also supported by a set of model-based optimal policy simulations conducted on various combinations of the trade scenarios discussed in the Eurosystem staff projections report, even when also factoring in upside scenarios for fiscal expenditure. By contrast, leaving the DFR on hold at 2.25 per cent could have triggered an adverse repricing of the forward curve and a revision in inflation expectations that would risk generating a more pronounced and longer-lasting undershoot of the inflation target. In turn, if this risk materialised, a stronger monetary reaction would ultimately be required.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, our monetary policy will have to take into account not only the most likely path (the baseline) but also the risks to activity and inflation. To this end, it will be important to explore how alternative rate paths hold up in various plausible sensitivity and scenario analyses, in order to make sure we minimise the risk of extended deviations from our medium-term target.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, and welcome to the ISDA Treasury Forum. Thank you to CME Group, our founding sponsor, for partnering with us again on this event, and to our gold sponsors, Clearly Gottlieb and Smart Communications.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, ISDA is celebrating its 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary this year.</p>
<p>The International Swap Dealers Association, as it was originally known, was established in 1985 with a clear objective. A small group of dealers wanted to alleviate the growing documentation backlog, so they got together to agree a common terminology and develop standard-form agreements.</p>
<p>That was only the start of the ISDA story. Today, our membership spans more than 1,000 entities across 76 countries.</p>
<p>Time and again over the past 40 years, ISDA has developed critical standards and best practices and helped firms navigate seismic industry transitions.</p>
<p>From the introduction of post-crisis regulatory reforms to the removal of LIBOR, ISDA has consistently worked with its members to enable industry changes to be implemented safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, there&rsquo;s another major industry transition on the horizon.</p>
<p>The US Treasury market is about to undergo profound regulatory reforms to improve its resilience and stability, including mandatory clearing requirements for certain cash and repo transactions.</p>
<p>The Treasury market is the world&rsquo;s deepest and most liquid financial market and is the primary means by which the US government raises funding. Treasury repos are also widely used to support the exchange of collateral, which is central to the functioning of the derivatives market.</p>
<p>With outstanding issuance of nearly $30 trillion, the market is forecast to grow to $52 trillion by the end of 2035.</p>
<p>In short, this is a systemically important market that plays a vital role in the global economy. It&rsquo;s therefore critical that the market functions safely and efficiently and remains liquid and resilient during periods of stress.</p>
<p>Regulators think clearing is part of the answer.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finalized its Treasury market reforms in December 2023 and the first clearing mandates for cash transactions are due to come into effect at the end of 2026, with repos following six months later.</p>
<p>As it stands, however, banks will be severely limited in their ability to participate in this market.</p>
<p>Important changes must be made to the regulatory framework to ensure banks have sufficient capacity to offer client clearing and intermediation services, so the US Treasury market remains deep and liquid &ndash; in both good times and bad.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I&rsquo;ll set out the changes that must be made to ensure Treasury clearing can work as regulators want it to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also explore the industry work that is underway to prepare for Treasury clearing.</p>
<p><span>Regulatory framework &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There are three distinct flaws in the US capital framework that would make it very difficult for banks to provide liquidity and support the increase in clearing that sits at the heart of the SEC&rsquo;s US Treasury reforms.</p>
<p>All three flaws must be fixed.</p>
<p>The first is the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which acts as a non-risk-sensitive constraint on banks and can hamper balance sheet capacity, particularly during periods of stress.</p>
<p>In April 2020, at the height of the global pandemic, the Federal Reserve temporarily excluded US Treasuries from the SLR calculation. ISDA has proposed reintroducing this exemption on a permanent basis to ensure banks have the capacity to provide intermediation and client clearing services.</p>
<p>Senior policymakers &ndash; including Federl Reserve chair Jerome Powell &ndash; have acknowledged that the SLR needs to be reformed, and we would urge US banking agencies to conduct a consultation as soon as possible to determine the best way forward.</p>
<p>The second issue is the impact of the proposed Basel III endgame rules and the capital surcharge for US global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).</p>
<p>Analysis by ISDA and SIFMA has shown that these two measures would increase capital for G-SIB client clearing businesses by more than 80%.</p>
<p>This punitive tax is completely at odds with the policy objective to promote greater use of client clearing.</p>
<p>It would challenge the economic viability of client clearing businesses at precisely the time when thousands of firms will be looking to banks to help them clear their US Treasury and repo transactions.</p>
<p>This is a serious calibration error that must be corrected to avoid disproportionate capital increases that would thwart the transition to Treasury clearing.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s critical that the amount of margin posted and corresponding bank capital requirements reflect the actual risk in client portfolios.</p>
<p>Clients must be able to realize the benefits of cross-margining and related cross-product netting across US Treasury securities and futures.</p>
<p>Cross-margining programs have been a widely accepted part of cleared markets for two decades. They ensure the initial margin posted reflects the actual risk of a portfolio of trades, even if those trades are cleared at different central counterparties.</p>
<p>For example, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) and CME operate an approved cross-margining program that enables clearing members to realize initial margin efficiencies from offsetting trades in a portfolio of Treasury cash, repo and futures transactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s critical that this cross-margining program is extended to client transactions and regulators act quickly to approve it once they do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also no recognition in the capital framework of the risk-reducing benefits of netting across US Treasury repos and futures.</p>
<p>Without this recognition, banks will face elevated capital requirements because of higher exposures, combined with reduced margin posted by clients under the cross-margining program.</p>
<p>In this scenario, a bank would either be forced to require a customer to post the full amount of margin &ndash; foregoing the benefits of cross-margining programs &ndash; or face a significant increase in capital requirements.</p>
<p>Let me be absolutely clear. If we&rsquo;re to successfully transition to increased clearing in the US Treasury market, these flaws must be properly addressed.</p>
<p>ISDA has analyzed each issue in detail and proposed potential fixes. Unless these fixes are applied, bank balance sheet capacity will come under strain, threatening the ability of banks to absorb the massive supply of new Treasury issuance and facilitate client clearing. Disruption in the Treasury repo market could also impair the exchange of collateral for cleared and non-cleared derivatives.</p>
<p>The stakes are high and there are no shortcuts.</p>
<p>ISDA will continue to engage with policymakers to make sure the prudential framework is appropriately adjusted so it supports, rather than impairs, liquidity and resilience in the Treasury market.</p>
<p><span>Industry preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;ll briefly highlight the state of play in terms of preparations.</p>
<p>Last year, FICC released proposed changes to its rule book, while CME has published proposals for a new clearing service. ICE has also announced it will launch a Treasury clearing service.</p>
<p>As it stands, FICC offers several varieties of direct clearing and sponsored clearing and has proposed a new agency model. CME&rsquo;s proposal includes direct clearing plus two varieties of agency-like clearing.</p>
<p>These services all entail different obligations for members and users, and would have varying implications for collateral segregation, accounting and netting.</p>
<p>Market participants need to make sure they&rsquo;re up to speed with the different clearing services that will be available &ndash; and our first panel this morning on clearing models should help with that.</p>
<p>If you want additional information, ISDA has published a comparison of various clearing models for US Treasury transactions and derivatives, and we&rsquo;ll continue to update this as new models emerge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also been participating in an industry group led by SIFMA that&rsquo;s developing appropriate client documentation.</p>
<p>Good progress has been made, but the documentation needs to work for the various clearing models and rule books that are still being developed, as well as client segregation solutions, some of which have yet to be finalized. Work is also needed to make sure the documentation covers done-away clearing.</p>
<p>Once documentation has been finalized, dealers will need to execute the documents with thousands of counterparties, as well as obtain netting opinions in the US and multiple foreign jurisdictions to ensure efficient capital treatment.</p>
<p>We know from the implementation of margin rules for non-cleared derivatives that this is a considerable amount of work and it will take time.</p>
<p>ISDA will continue to work closely with clearing houses and market participants to make sure momentum is maintained in the months ahead.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>I started these remarks by reflecting on ISDA&rsquo;s 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary and how we never shy away from addressing the biggest challenges confronting financial markets.</p>
<p>From the removal of LIBOR to the rollout of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives, every challenge was unique, but the process has remained consistent. We analyze the issues, we engage closely with our members and policymakers, and we help to develop solutions when they&rsquo;re needed. And together, we effect change.</p>
<p>Treasury clearing is no different. It&rsquo;s a huge change for the world&rsquo;s most systemically important market, so we must get it right.</p>
<p>With close collaboration between the public and private sectors and diligent preparation, I&rsquo;m confident we will.</p>
<p>Conferences like these provide a valuable forum for discussion. They help market participants get to grips with the changes that are coming and the challenges that need to be overcome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to close by thanking all our speakers, sponsors and delegates, and I hope you find the sessions constructive and engaging.</p>
<p>To get us started, I&rsquo;d like to introduce Agha Mirza, managing director and global head of rates and OTC products at CME Group, who will give some welcoming remarks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to take this opportunity to thank CME once again for working with us on this event and for being such a great partner.</p>
<p>Agha, over to you.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It is a pleasure to join you today at the UK Finance Digital Innovation Summit and to witness such vibrant and forward-looking activity. Events like this are a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of innovation, unlocking new products and services that are more secure, more efficient, and ultimately more beneficial for households and for businesses. As a member of the National Payments Delivery Committee, it is a pleasure to see such a focus on innovation in payments: they are the lifeblood of the economy and can unlock growth.</p>
<p>I am looking forward later this afternoon to announcing the winner of the ideathon, which has focused on account-to-account payments. During a time where our payments landscape is changing, it is essential to think creatively about these important retail payments, and how they can deliver real benefits to consumers.</p>
<p>There is also considerable innovation within the wholesale payments ecosystem: high value payments typically made by financial institutions, large businesses and governments. Today I want to highlight how the Bank of England, in particular through our Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service, is enabling innovation in wholesale payments, and how this in turn enables innovation in the financial markets these payments underpin. I will explain how we will continue to adapt and evolve our service to enable the risk reduction benefits delivered through settlement in central bank money to be realised by new business models and technologies. Of course, what we deliver is only one part of a broader vision. We work closely with other authorities, at home and abroad, so that our initiatives are aligned, mutually reinforcing, and creating the conditions for positive change in payments. It is through this&nbsp;collaborative approach and through close cooperation with industry&nbsp;that we can deliver a payments ecosystem that is resilient, inclusive, and fit for the future.</p>
<p>I will outline why RTGS is so important and then explain the innovation we have recently delivered through the RTGS Renewal Programme, the benefits it is already delivering, and the opportunities it unlocks for the future. And when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I do not just mean the Bank of England, I mean the payments ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<p>One could liken the programme to renew RTGS to launching one of the first satellites into orbit. It is a major technical achievement, made possible by the dedication and collaboration of many with a shared vision, and safety has been central to every step in the process. And like those early satellites, it is also a launchpad for future change: a platform that opens up new frontiers for innovation, enabling the private sector to develop the next generation of services to benefit people and businesses making payments across the UK and cross border.<em>&nbsp;</em>Ultimately, its benefits apply to everyone, however indirectly. Alongside changes to regulation and policy, the renewed RTGS infrastructure (RT2) facilitates a diverse and innovative ecosystem. One where banks, non-banks, and market infrastructures &ndash; including new entrants &ndash; have a safe platform on which to innovate, fostering economic growth and financial inclusion.</p>
<h3>What is RTGS and what was RTGS Renewal?</h3>
<p>RTGS is the infrastructure at the heart of the UK&rsquo;s financial system, enabling the real-time transfer of payments between financial institutions, settled in central bank money &ndash; the ultimate risk-free settlement asset.</p>
<p>RTGS underpins the settlement of payments through CHAPS (the UK&rsquo;s high value payment system), supports securities settlement in CREST, and plays a crucial role in settlement of exposures in the UK&rsquo;s retail payment systems. It plays a role in the smooth functioning of every single electronic payment in the UK, averaging settlement of almost &pound;800bn per day. RTGS is essential for&nbsp;financial stability. And also for&nbsp;monetary stability, as it is a key component of the mechanism through which Bank Rate is transmitted through the economy.</p>
<p>In close collaboration with industry, we developed a vision for an RTGS service that was not just more resilient but would also promote competition and innovation. There were four objectives which were our north star throughout the RTGS Renewal Programme: higher resilience, broader access, wider interoperability and improved user functionality. The first major deliverable was the introduction of ISO 20022 messaging for CHAPS payments in June 2023: a foundational step in modernising the UK&rsquo;s wholesale payments infrastructure and enhancing interoperability. On 28 April this year, we successfully launched our renewed RTGS core ledger and settlement engine including a new user interface: improving resilience, enhancing functionality, and providing a strong platform for further change.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the success of this major transformation programme. It was a complex programme, delivered in a complex environment, during a time of change for payments globally. It would not have been possible without the dedication, professionalism, and collaboration of all involved. This was not only the teams at the Bank, our Technology Delivery Partner (Accenture) and key suppliers. But also the almost&nbsp;250 industry participants&nbsp;involved in the Programme, shaping the vision and ensuring their own readiness. Engagement with industry was embedded from the outset and this inclusive approach meant that what we built not only met the highest standards of resilience, but also&nbsp;reflected the needs of the industry.</p>
<p>But building the system was only part of the challenge. We also needed&nbsp;every one of those participants to be ready for go-live, having made the necessary changes to their own technical and operational processes. That every participant was prepared and ready on time is a&nbsp;great achievement, and a testament to the strength of collaboration between the Bank and the wider payments community.</p>
<p>We are now almost two months on from go-live, and have settled over 8 million CHAPS payments, and a total value across all RTGS settlement services exceeding &pound;30 trillion. That is enough to run the International Space Station for over 13,000 years!</p>
<p>These are not just numbers. They are a reflection of the importance of the infrastructure we have built together, and the payments that make up the UK economy, each of which is important to the household or business making it.</p>
<h3>Benefits already unlocked</h3>
<p>RT2 is already delivering tangible benefits in line with our four objectives.</p>
<p>As a critical part of the UK&rsquo;s national infrastructure, RT2 needs to be well protected, monitored closely and have excellent response and recovery capabilities. We have delivered improvements in all three areas. In terms of protection, we have enhanced security and segregation of the system&rsquo;s core components; leveraged new geographically diverse data centres; and introduced a new robust independent data source. We have upgraded our monitoring capabilities, both during and outside of business hours, and introduced continuous and cross system reconciliations to improve detection of issues. And we have undertaken extensive major incident testing to recover quickly and within our risk tolerance.</p>
<p>But we wanted to go further, to make RT2 an enabler of competition and innovation:</p>
<h4>Improved user functionality</h4>
<p>Our new user interface, affectionately known as BERTI (the Bank of England Real Time Interface), provides participants with a more modern experience, supporting smoother operations and better access to information, including access to BERTI 24/7 for account queries. We have introduced APIs, enabling participants to interact with the system in a more dynamic and programmable way. Since launch, we have seen over 43,000 API calls.</p>
<h4>Broader access and inclusion</h4>
<p>Over recent years we have extended our access policies significantly, giving a wider range of financial institutions and new business models the ability to settle transactions directly in central bank money.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2017 we were the first major central bank to allow non-bank payment service providers to hold accounts in RTGS, enabling them to join CHAPS and the retail payment schemes for the first time, and to compete with the traditional high-street banks.</li>
<li>We have also welcomed our first omnibus account holder into CHAPS: a wholesale digital settlement platform provider. Omnibus accounts allow recognised payment system operators to pool participant funds, allowing them in effect to tokenise central bank money, ensuring it retains its crucial role at the heart of digitalised, as well as traditional wholesale markets. This structure also mitigates credit and settlement risk, even outside RTGS operating hours, and marks a significant step forward in enabling new models of digital settlement.</li>
</ul>
<p>RT2 also supports our ongoing access ambitions by enabling a far larger number of participants in the system, and by streamlining onboarding processes.</p>
<h4>Wider interoperability</h4>
<p>The migration to&nbsp;the global messaging standard ISO 20022&nbsp;for CHAPS payments in 2023 was a significant step towards global harmonisation and greater interoperability. It is a key contributor to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d218.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reducing frictions and inefficiencies<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;in cross-border payments, which, alongside other roadmap priorities, the G20 have highlighted supports economic growth, international trade, global development and financial inclusion.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/june/victoria-cleland-keynote-speech-at-the-uk-finance-digital-innovation-summit#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Richer, more structured data within these messages enhances transparency and efficiency and lays the ground for innovation both for domestic and cross-border payments. We have mandated the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) and purpose codes in certain CHAPS payments, reflecting our belief that enhanced data benefits a wide range of stakeholders, and since mandation took effect on 1 May we&rsquo;ve seen population of this data skyrocket. Improved data in payments can help the industry to detect fraud, manage risk, and provide insights into payment trends: please use it! And for the Bank, this data enables us to identify early changes in behaviour and risk to support our monetary and financial stability policy decisions.</p>
<h4>Enabling future change</h4>
<p>We have developed RT2 to be adaptable by building it with a&nbsp;modular architecture, allowing us to update or replace individual components as technology evolves. This makes it easier to maintain and enables us to respond swiftly to future innovation and policy needs in the ever-evolving payments landscape.</p>
<h3>Our strategy for RT2</h3>
<p>Satellite technology laid the foundations for innovations such as GPS, mobile phones, and satellite television. RT2 is also designed to be a platform for the future, enabling private firms to innovate and develop new products and services that deliver real benefits. This innovation has the potential to change the way that end-users interact with payments: through products that reduce risk and cost, offer new services and functionality, and are faster and smoother. And this in turn, can support UK economic growth through reducing liquidity needs, freeing up collateral and making assets more monetisable while driving efficiencies.</p>
<p>Our Vision is that RTGS is a resilient and widely used platform for central bank money settlement, enabling growth and innovation. To achieve this, we are committed to excelling in providing a platform that is resilient and responsive. I would like to spend a few minutes expanding on what steps we are taking to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>We have created RT2 to act as an open platform for change and innovation, supporting the Bank&rsquo;s monetary and financial stability objectives. And also for driving improvements in wholesale settlement efficiency and competition. As the payments landscape evolves, we need to preserve the critical role of central bank money and confidence in the financial system, including trust in money. This will mean evolution to ensure that RT2, along with the regulatory system and wider ecosystem, can support new business models and technologies, from both new entrants and existing players.</p>
<p>We are committed to continuously improving our services to keep pace with this rapidly changing world and to enable ongoing innovation. But we know we cannot do this alone. Collaboration with other infrastructure providers in the UK and beyond is essential. In a similar vein to satellite networks relying on coordination across borders, we are actively sharing lessons learned and working on design of new functionality with peers undertaking similar modernisation programmes.<em>&nbsp;</em>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">G20 roadmap for cross border payments<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;demonstrates the benefits of continuing to work together to deliver payment systems which are interoperable through consistent messaging standards, access policies, opening hours, and legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Interoperability is important domestically too, making it more efficient for new technologies and overlay services, as well as existing organisations, to interact with both CHAPS and the UK&rsquo;s retail payment systems.</p>
<p>Many of you have contributed to our priorities through responding to our consultations. This includes what we call our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-future-roadmap">Future Roadmap</a>&nbsp;&ndash; our strategic plan for how we continue to evolve the service to meet changing user demands and policy objectives.</p>
<p>We are working with industry to explore enhancements across four key dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>What</span>&nbsp;we offer,</li>
<li><span>Who&nbsp;</span>can use the service,</li>
<li><span>When</span>&nbsp;the service is available,</li>
<li>And<span>&nbsp;how</span>&nbsp;it is used.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>What services we offer</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Synchronisation: Synchronisation can enable conditional settlement across accounts in RT2 with movements on another asset ledger &ndash; such as digitised bonds &ndash; reducing settlement risk and enabling digitalisation of these activities. Our proposed model here would see the Bank delivering the functionality required for this within RTGS, but would leave development and delivery of specific products utilising this functionality to &ldquo;synchronisation operators&rdquo; in the private sector, driving further competition and innovation. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of such a model for foreign exchange transactions, through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/meridian_fx.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project Meridian FX,<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;a collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hubs in London and Eurosystem centres, and other central banks. Building on this, the Bank will launch a&nbsp;synchronisation lab in 2026 to enable potential synchronisation operators to test real-world use cases with our planned synchronisation functionality. And dependent on the success of this, our intention is to deliver this into production as soon as we can.</li>
<li>Wholesale experimentation<span>:&nbsp;</span>We are also planning a series of experiments around wholesale settlement, looking at whether there is anything further, beyond synchronisation, we can do to enable the next generation of innovative use cases to emerge. This model might involve a wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency, enabling a unified single ledger for tokenised assets and payments. Our first experiment will test synchronised settlement of a tokenised bond across, with findings expected by end 2025. And yesterday, we published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/fintech/dlt-innovation-challenge?sc_mode=normal" target="_blank">DLT Innovation Challenge<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, in collaboration with the BIS Innovation Hub London, seeking input from the private sector to understand how to incorporate distributed ledger technology into wholesale central bank settlement through an external programmable ledger managed by a third party.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Who can use the service</h4>
<ul>
<li>Access: While our existing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/access-policy-rtgs-settlement-accounts-services">access policies</a>&nbsp;provide a strong basis for supporting innovation, we have recently issued our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/dp/response-reviewing-access-to-rtgs-accounts-for-settlement">response</a>&nbsp;to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/dp/reviewing-access-to-rtgs-accounts-for-settlement">discussion paper</a>&nbsp;setting out where we believe further enhancements can be made. We have made information about participating in RTGS more accessible and transparent, including clarifying the access requirements for non-bank payment service providers. To facilitate new entrants, drawing on the successful model of mobilisation for banks, we have introduced a new &ldquo;stage gate&rdquo; approach to allow participants, particularly new financial market infrastructure, to grow their business in a controlled way subject to risk reducing controls. And looking further ahead, we are exploring further the thresholds for CHAPS access i.e. when an organisation should be direct rather than indirect, and whether we should allow non-bank payment service providers to safeguard client funds at the Bank, potentially reducing their reliance on the very organisations in the commercial sector who they compete with.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>When the service is available</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Extended settlement hours: Building on the G20 roadmap,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2024/response-to-the-discussion-paper-exploring-extended-rtgs-hours">our analysis</a>&nbsp;has shown that longer RTGS settlement hours in the UK could unlock further benefits, including alignment with international peers, reduced cross-border frictions and lower settlement risk. We are assessing now how best to implement this: we believe it is most appropriate to deliver this through a phased approach with earlier opening of CHAPS, aiming for 2027, with an ambition to move closer to near 24/7 settlement around the end of the decade. We will be consulting on the earlier opening of CHAPS next month.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>How the service is used</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>APIs: We are continuing to evolve our API offerings to meet the needs of a more dynamic and programmable financial ecosystem. This will be a process of gradual improvement &ndash; while most of our current APIs allow participants to access data, we are expanding the range of APIs and working towards a world where participants can instruct payments via API, subject to key risk controls.</li>
<li>ISO 20022: We continue to iterate the ISO 20022 messages used in CHAPS and RTGS to ensure that we maintain international interoperability and deliver ongoing improvements. We remain a&nbsp;champion of standardisation and richer data, and we are in active dialogue with industry about whether further mandation of specific data elements could unlock even greater benefits, particularly for end-users, through development of new products utilising this data and richer analysis by linking these with other datasets.<span></span></li>
<li>Resilience enhancements: While RT2 itself is strong and robust, we are committed to continuous improvements to address evolving threats and new services. In particular, we are looking at how new ways of accessing RTGS would strengthen resilience and reduce reliance on third parties and single points of failure. And tied into this, we continually look for ways to further strengthen the overall resilience of the UK wholesale ecosystem, including review of our tertiary contingency solution for RT2, MIRS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have focused today on RT2, highlighting what it now does and further enhancements in train to further support innovation in the UK payments ecosystem. But we should not forget the other parts of the wholesale payments jigsaw being delivered by the UK authorities. We also continue to work with colleagues across the Bank on other wholesale initiatives, including the pilot programme launched by the Bank and HMT exploring the use of DLT technology in the issuance and management of sovereign debt (DIGIT). This leverages the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS) launched by the Bank to support innovation in post-trade settlement. The Bank is also leading the ongoing drive towards T+1 securities settlement in 2027. In the retail space, the Bank is exploring a digital pound, which if introduced would be like a banknote for the digital era. This would be accessible through digital wallets provided by private sector intermediaries and could be spent in shops or online.</p>
<p>We are delivering these initiatives&nbsp;collaboratively, through both co-creation with the industry and working closely with authorities here and overseas.</p>
<h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>I would like to end with two calls for action from you. We have provided the initial foundations for success in building the next generation market infrastructure for money, payments and securities settlement. So my first call is for industry to use the new infrastructure to the full and to reap its benefits, securing the UK as a world leading digital wholesale market. The second is a call for continued engagement. Your insights, your innovation, and your partnership are essential to ensuring that RT2, and the wider wholesale payments ecosystem, continues to evolve and support end users.</p>
<p>Just as satellite technology transformed the way we navigate the world, we believe RTGS can help transform the way&nbsp;value moves through the economy. And in doing so, it will be a&nbsp;major contributor to growth and to the UK leading the way in payments innovation.</p>

<title>Next-Generation Monetary And Financial System Takes Shape, Based On A Tokenised Unified Ledger: BIS</title>

<div id="cmsContent">
<ul>
<li>Building on the proposal for a unified ledger, the "trilogy" of tokenised central bank reserves, commercial bank money and government bonds is the next logical step to deliver profound change for the financial system.</li>
<li>Tokenisation can enhance efficiency and open new possibilities in cross-border payments, securities markets and beyond, while maintaining the key principles of sound money: singleness, elasticity and integrity.</li>
<li>Stablecoins as a form of sound money fall short, and without regulation pose a risk to financial stability and monetary sovereignty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tokenised unified ledger incorporating central bank money, commercial bank deposits and government bonds will lay the foundations of a tokenised monetary and financial system based on the time-tested principles of sound money, the Bank for International Settlements said today, as it called on central banks and public authorities to pave the way for this next phase.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm"><span class="firstword">special</span>&nbsp;chapter</a>&nbsp;of the BIS's Annual Economic Report 2025 builds on the principles of the unified ledger by laying out a more detailed blueprint for how this concept can combine the "trilogy" of tokenised central bank reserves, tokenised commercial bank money and tokenised government bonds, while maintaining the core elements of a sound monetary system based on trust in central bank money.</p>
<p>Tokenisation &ndash; the digital representation of assets on programmable platforms &ndash; integrates messaging, reconciliation and settlement into a single seamless operation, and can transform cross-border payments and securities markets, ushering in a new era for the financial system.</p>

<p><span>Tokenisation of deposits and central bank money means that both the primary means of payment as well as the settlement function of central bank money can be integrated seamlessly on the same programmable platform. It has the potential to transform securities&nbsp;</span><span>markets and its application to correspondent banking is especially promising.</span></p>

<p>While stablecoins may eventually play a subsidiary role in the hinterland of the financial system if adequately regulated, they do not deliver singleness of money (acceptance for payment at par), elasticity (timely discharge of obligations, preventing gridlock) and integrity (safeguarding against financial crime). Therefore, besides acting as a gateway to the crypto ecosystem, their future role is unclear.</p>

<p><span>The next-generation monetary and financial system combines the time-tested principles of trust in money underpinned by central banks with the functionality unlocked by tokenisation. This system is poised to deliver substantial improvements to current practices and to enable entirely new economic arrangements. Realising the full potential of the system requires bold actions by central banks, which need to work in partnership with the private sector and other public authorities.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 11th official meeting of the U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group (Working Group) took place in London on 3 June 2025.</p>
<p>Officials and senior staff from HM Treasury and the U.S. Department of the Treasury were joined by representatives from the Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Securities and Exchange Commission. Participation varied across themes, with participants expressing views on issues in their organizations&rsquo; respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Working Group meeting emphasized close ongoing UK and U.S. cooperation in a number of areas and focused on several key themes, including: 1) the economic and financial stability outlook, 2) regulatory developments, 3) digital finance and innovation, and 4) the investment environment.</p>
<p>The meeting opened with a broad discussion of the UK and U.S. economic and financial stability outlooks, with participants taking stock of current economic trends and market conditions and considering broader global factors. Both UK and U.S. Treasuries emphasised the need to support long-term economic growth, including moving towards a pro-growth regulatory system, while upholding robust financial regulatory standards that facilitate cross-border activity and are essential for global financial stability.</p>
<p>The parties exchanged views on the work in multilateral fora such as the Financial Stability Board (<abbr title="Financial Stability Board">FSB</abbr>) and the G20 and welcomed the recent confirmation of the Governor of the Bank of England as&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Stability Board">FSB</abbr>&nbsp;Chair. The Working Group continued with a discussion of developments in non-bank financial intermediation (<abbr title="non-bank financial intermediation">NBFI</abbr>), with participants updating on their respective domestic agendas and their continued international engagement on this topic.</p>
<p>Participants offered an overview of developments in their domestic banking systems and banking regulation. This included resolution-related developments and the adoption of capital requirements which support long-term growth and financial stability. The UK updated on the passing of the Bank Resolution (Recapitalisation) Act. Participants noted the importance of ongoing dialogue among international partners when implementing these initiatives and reforms.</p>
<p>On cybersecurity and operational resilience issues, participants noted ongoing international cooperation, including at the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Stability Board">FSB</abbr>, and shared updates. Participants continued discussions on the importance of working with industry to improve the resilience of the financial sector.&nbsp;The Working Group also discussed approaches to cybersecurity and operational resilience for supervised institutions and opportunities for further collaboration.</p>
<p>Participants discussed issues related to digital finance and innovation. Representatives discussed respective priorities for digital assets and provided updates on the progress of legislation in both jurisdictions, including legislation to regulate stablecoins. UK participants also updated on their Digital Securities Sandbox, and building on recent discussions between the Chancellor and the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the Working Group discussed exploring potential opportunities to support cross-border innovation. Participants emphasized the importance of effective regulation in promoting economic growth while also addressing risks and continued bilateral and international engagement within the sector and among authorities. The Working Group also discussed work underway to enhance cross-border payments, including implementation of recommendations under the G20 Cross-Border Payments Roadmap, as well as support for appropriate future actions as necessary. Participants shared recent developments in their respective work on payments modernisation.</p>
<p>Representatives exchanged views on their respective approaches to artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) and both current and future&nbsp;<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>&nbsp;use cases within financial services. U.S. and UK authorities discussed ways to work together, including as appropriate through international bodies, to realize the potential of this technology and mitigate the potential risks of&nbsp;<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>&nbsp;in financial services.</p>
<p>Participants conferred on the investment environment, including capital markets regulation. UK Treasury set out the UK government&rsquo;s programme of reforms to reinvigorate capital markets, including its commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027 and its recent pensions reforms to drive investment and innovation in the economy. U.S. participants shared observations on their transition to T+1 in May 2024. UK regulators updated participants on recently implemented changes to the UK Listing Rules.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the event, the Working Group agreed to reconvene by early 2026, while noting the importance of continued open dialogue on shared priorities.</p>
<p>The U.S.-UK Financial Regulatory Working Group is an ongoing biannual dialogue established in 2018 to deepen bilateral regulatory cooperation and to enhance financial stability; investor protection; fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and capital formation across both jurisdictions.</p>

<title>Semiannual Monetary Policy Report To The Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, Before The Committee On Financial Services, U.S. House Of Representatives</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/semiannual-monetary-policy-report-to-the-congress-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-2025624/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/semiannual-monetary-policy-report-to-the-congress-federal-reserve-chair-jerome-2025624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/mpr_default.htm">Monetary Policy Report</a>.</em></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on achieving our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective. We are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</p>
<p>I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.</p>
<p><span>Current Economic Situation and Outlook</span><br />Incoming data suggest that the economy remains solid. Following growth of 2.5 percent last year, gross domestic product (GDP) was reported to have edged down in the first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports ahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP)&mdash;which excludes net exports, inventory investment, and government spending&mdash;grew at a solid 2.5 percent rate. Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated, while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter. Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.</p>
<p>In the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged a moderate 124,000 per month in the first five months of the year. The unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent in May, remains low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, a wide set of indicators suggests that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The strong labor market conditions in recent years have helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.</p>
<p>Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the consumer price index and other data indicate that total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in May and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6 percent. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Respondents to surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as the driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. With the labor market at or near maximum employment and inflation remaining somewhat elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent since the beginning of the year. We have also continued to reduce our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and, beginning in April, further slowed the pace of this decline to facilitate a smooth transition to ample reserve balances. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p>Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain. The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined. Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.</p>
<p>The effects on inflation could be short lived&mdash;reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</p>
<p>The FOMC's obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates, keeping in mind that, without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.</p>
<p>For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.</p>
<p>To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.</p>
<p>Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.</p>

<title>CSDonDLT: New KDPW Project Based On Blockchain Technology. Capital Market rEvolution</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/csdondlt-new-kdpw-project-based-on-blockchain-technology-capital-market-revolu-2025624/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/csdondlt-new-kdpw-project-based-on-blockchain-technology-capital-market-revolu-2025624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>KDPW is implementing the CSDonDLT project which aims to gauge the impact and added value of implementing solutions based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) in central securities depository services. The first step in this direction is to create a solution to enable the settlement of OTC transactions using blockchain.</b></p>
<p>The CSDonDLT project and the accompanying White Paper present new current experiences and observations of KDPW regarding the potential and benefits of using blockchain as a supplement and functional extension of the traditional capital market infrastructure.</p>
<p>The White Paper is available on&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.csdondlt.kdpw.pl/en/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.csdondlt.kdpw.pl/en/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.csdondlt.kdpw.pl/en/index.html</a></p>
<p>The CSDonDLT project will result in the implementation of an additional complementary layer of the depository and settlement system based on blockchain. At this stage, the solution under development focuses on the settlement of OTC transactions, covering the safe-keeping and unencumbered transfer of securities as well as the atomic settlement of transactions within the DLT layer. Full interoperability of both layers of the depository and settlement system will enable smooth transfers of securities from the traditional layer to DLT and vice versa.</p>
<p>In KDPW&rsquo;s opinion, blockchain allows to redefine and create new models for the safe-keeping and transfer of assets and to build trust between market participants in a shared distributed IT solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Traditional capital market infrastructure, while effective, efficient and secure, is marked by significant complexity and centralisation of processes. Each transaction requires the cooperation of multiple entities and the reconciliation of data stored in separate IT systems operated by market participants. In this context, distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a promising solution that can significantly improve the functioning of capital markets by increasing efficiency while reducing risks and transaction costs. The fundamental value of DLT is a single, unalterable, transparent ledger shared by all market participants while maintaining confidentiality and professional secrecy,</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Maciej Trybuchowski, President and CEO of KDPW and KDPW_CCP</b>.</p>
<p>With a single distributed system shared by all market participants, DLT-based systems would theoretically eliminate intermediaries in the execution of market processes. However, the exclusion of professional intermediaries from the value chain brings a number of new risks. The presence of institutions such as central securities depositories, banks, and investment firms is essential to ensure the stability of capital markets. These entities play a key role in managing systemic risk, protecting investors, and meeting regulatory requirements, including those arising from KYC (customer identity and risk profile verification) and AML (anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing).</p>
<p>The presented project is an important step towards the modernisation and development of the domestic capital market infrastructure, responding both to global trends and to initiatives undertaken by other European markets in the implementation of innovative technologies and new business and operating models.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The White Paper available on the KDPW website is an invitation to market institutions, including primarily KDPW participants, to join the CSDonDLT project, cooperate and make a joint effort to improve innovation in the Polish capital market. The participation of a wide range of capital market institutions in co-creating a DLT infrastructure integrated into the current ecosystem and consequently offering clients the possibility of maintaining separate securities account functionality in the blockchain network, may indeed open up new opportunities for the development of services and of the market as such,</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>said Maciej Trybuchowski</b>.</p>
<p>The transformation of infrastructure and market models should primarily focus on integrating innovative technologies with existing structures in order to maximise the benefits of DLT while protecting the stability and security of the financial system. This approach makes it possible to achieve economies of scale and leverage the strengths and advantages of new and traditional models. This, in turn, contributes significantly to the cutting edge of the Polish capital market in Europe, both with regard to traditional financial instruments and in terms of creating synergies between this market and the dynamically developing financial services on cryptoasset markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We at KDPW see DLT not as a threat to traditional institutions but as an opportunity for their transformation and adaptation to the requirements of the modern digital economy. KDPW&rsquo;s experience with distributed technologies confirms that it is possible for blockchain-based solutions to coexist harmoniously with legacy market structures. The key to success is the integration, not the elimination, of professional intermediaries and financial institutions, which play and will certainly continue to play a key role in ensuring market stability, efficiency and security, including investor protection,</i>&rdquo; added&nbsp;<b>Mr Trybuchowski.</b></p>
<p>In the face of dynamic regulatory and technological changes, Poland has an opportunity to develop its own complementary capital market model which on the one hand takes into account local specificities and on the other hand is open to cross-border applications. We are ready to play a leading role in this process, and we invite market institutions to jointly design a future based on a modern, secure and competitive capital market infrastructure.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>Digital Asset, the company behind the pioneering Canton Network, today announced it has raised $135 million in its strategic funding round. Led by</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>DRW Venture Capital</b><span>&nbsp;and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Tradeweb Markets</b><span>, the round includes participation from major institutions in both traditional and decentralized finance, including</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>BNP Paribas</b><span>,<b>&nbsp;Circle Ventures</b>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Citadel Securities</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC)</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Goldman Sachs</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>IMC</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Liberty City Ventures</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Optiver</b><span>,<b>&nbsp;Paxos</b>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Polychain&nbsp;Capital</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>QCP</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Republic Digital</b><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>7RIDGE</b><span>, and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Virtu Financial</b><span>.</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>This funding accelerates institutional and decentralized finance adoption on the Canton Network, the only public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain that offers configurable privacy and institutional-grade compliance at scale. The capital will rapidly expand the integration of hundreds of billions of real-world assets (RWAs) onto Canton, building upon its already substantial deployment of diverse asset classes, including bonds, money market funds, alternative funds, commodities, repurchase agreements (repos), mortgages, life insurance, and annuities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>The raise also deepens the relationship with several firms already part of the Canton Network and its Global Synchronizer Foundation, including, BNP Paribas, DRW, Goldman Sachs, Liberty City Ventures, QCP, and Tradeweb, all of whom have played various roles in either the testing, governance, infrastructure, or app development on the Network since its inception. The Canton Network, built and operationalized by Digital Asset in close partnership with top global financial institutions and technology providers, represents the inevitable next phase of financial infrastructure. Canton has experienced rapid growth over the past year, with nearly 400 ecosystem participants on the Network, including global leaders in both traditional and decentralized finance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>This funding highlights the market&rsquo;s recognition of Digital Asset&rsquo;s vision and the pioneering design of the Canton Network, the only network built from the ground up with configurable on-chain privacy. By allowing institutions to tailor privacy settings to their specific needs, Canton overcomes the primary barrier to blockchain adoption: the conflict between transparency and financial confidentiality. As the first comprehensive solution of its kind, Canton bridges the gap between blockchain innovation and real-world financial compliance.</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><b><span>Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>&ldquo;This funding milestone validates the inevitability of what we envisioned years ago: a privacy-enabled public blockchain designed specifically for institutional adoption. Canton is already actively supporting numerous asset classes&ndash;from bonds to alternative funds&ndash;and this raise will accelerate onboarding even more real-world assets, finally making blockchain&rsquo;s transformative promise an institutional-scale reality.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><b><span>Don Wilson, Founder and CEO of DRW</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>"Today, major players from crypto and traditional finance have joined Digital Asset on its mission to catalyze the next evolution in markets. Building on the work that we started a decade ago, we are at the inflection point of being able to use blockchain at scale in traditional markets. With trillions of dollars&rsquo; worth of real-world assets already leveraging the Canton Blockchain, this next round of funding creates significant momentum for the company, and cements Canton as the de facto protocol for global collateral mobility."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><b><span>Billy Hult, CEO of Tradeweb</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>&ldquo;Digital Asset and Canton are addressing real-world challenges in financial markets, not just theoretical concepts. The fact that such a wide range of asset classes are already integrated onto Canton is an important sign that this network is ready for mainstream finance. We are excited to support Digital Asset&rsquo;s vision. At Tradeweb, we see DLT and smart contracts as catalysts for reimagining and reshaping market structure&mdash;unlocking workflow efficiencies and accelerating the shift toward electronic markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><b><span>Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>&ldquo;Goldman Sachs remains committed to accelerating the adoption of digital assets and a blockchain-powered financial system. Our longstanding relationship with Digital Asset stems from a deep conviction in the strength of their technology, which continues to be foundational to the development and ongoing success of GS DAP<sup>&reg;</sup>. We are pleased to participate in their latest funding round and to continue to support them as a critical player in the institutional digital asset ecosystem.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><b><span>Melvin Deng, CEO of QCP</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>&ldquo;We believe digital assets should be a core part of institutional finance, and at QCP, that&rsquo;s our mission. Canton is creating the kind of infrastructure that makes that possible - compliant, interoperable, and trusted. Our investment signals belief not only in the technology, but in the purpose behind it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><b><span>Josh Rosenthal, Partner at Polychain Capital</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p class="elementtoproof"><span>&ldquo;Canton Network addresses critical barriers&ndash;privacy, compliance, and scale&ndash;that have long hindered institutional DeFi adoption. Polychain invests in visionary infrastructure, and Canton&rsquo;s progress positions it as a catalyst for merging traditional finance with decentralized innovation.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>AutoRek Launches 18-Decimal Precision Crypto Reconciliation Platform, Mion  - Mion Addresses Critical Operational And Regulatory Challenges As Digital Assets Enter Mainstream Financial Services</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/autorek-launches-18-decimal-precision-crypto-reconciliation-platform-mion-mi-2025624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="elementToProof"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.autorek.com/mion/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=mionlaunch" id="OWAf308b2c9-c6fb-5c8b-35f3-13d0ab90d77f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Original URL: https://www.autorek.com/mion/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=mionlaunch. Click or tap if you trust this link.">AutoRek</a></span></span><span>, a leading provider of automated reconciliation and financial control solutions, today announced the launch of</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Mion, a groundbreaking data management and reconciliation platform specifically designed to handle cryptocurrency and digital asset operations with unprecedented precision. Mion addresses the critical gap in the market for financial institutions by processing up to 20 digits before and18 after the decimal point to deliver accuracy and scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>The digital asset market has experienced explosive growth, with global market capitalization for crypto rising from under $1 trillion at the start of 2021 to over $3 trillion in May 2025. This growth has been accompanied by increased institutional adoption and regulatory scrutiny, creating new operational challenges for financial services firms whose traditional systems were designed for conventional assets operating at 2-8 decimal places.</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Mion was developed in direct response to a client challenge. A leading US cryptocurrency custody and infrastructure provider approached AutoRek with a critical operational problem: existing reconciliation systems could not handle the precision requirements of crypto assets like Ethereum, which operates at 18 decimal places. AutoRek's development team responded by building Mion in just six months, creating an entirely new platform architecture capable of handling extreme precision requirements, without any compromise to performance and scalability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>"The financial services industry is at an inflection point with cryptocurrency adoption," said Chris Livesey, CEO of AutoRek. "When our client came to us with their challenge, it became clear that this wasn't just one client's problem &ndash; it was an industry-wide issue that needed solving. Traditional reconciliation systems simply cannot handle the precision requirements of these assets. Mion solves this fundamental problem, enabling institutions to maintain the same rigorous financial controls for crypto that they've relied on for traditional assets for decades."</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Mion brings all the core functionality that AutoRek customers have relied on for 30 years while introducing the ability to accurately handle numbers up to 20 digits before the decimal point and 18 after. Therefore, Mion can handle not just high precision numbers, but also very large numbers at high precision. This is critically important as crypto assets enter the mainstream, meaning precise matching and conversion of transaction, account, ledger and balance positions across currency types is not compromised by rounding or truncation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>"We've essentially rebuilt our AutoRek platform</span><span> </span><span>from the ground up for crypto, to solve a problem that clients said they were not able to deal with in other reconciliation tools." said Jim Sadler, Chief Product, Technology and Operations Officer at AutoRek. "The challenge wasn't just about displaying more decimal places &ndash; we had to create custom code to overcome fundamental database technology limitations. The platform features specialized proprietary functions that ensure mathematical calculations can be processed at these new levels of precision, enabling accurate valuations, currency calculations, and data aggregation for digital assets.</span><span> </span><span>&rdquo;</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>The platform addresses several critical challenges facing financial institutions entering the cryptocurrency space:</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Regulatory Compliance</b>: As regulators like the FCA and EU introduce new frameworks for crypto asset regulation, firms need systems capable of meeting reconciliation requirements for client safeguarding&nbsp; </li>
<li> <b>High-Volume Processing</b>: Growing cryptocurrency adoption is driving transaction volumes that require scalable operational infrastructure<span> </span>&nbsp; </li>
<li> <b>Precision Requirements</b>: Assets like Ethereum require 18-decimal precision that traditional financial systems cannot accommodate<span> </span>&nbsp; </li>
<li> <b>Complex Calculations</b>: Firms need to perform FX calculations, valuations, and other mathematical operations at unprecedented precision levels<span> </span>&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Mion includes comprehensive functionality for modern cryptocurrency operations, including extensive data ingestion capabilities, flexible rules engines, interactive dashboards, integrated workflow management, and API connectivity for external system integration.</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>The launch comes as regulatory bodies worldwide are developing comprehensive frameworks for cryptocurrency oversight. The FCA's discussion paper DP23/4 and the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) both emphasize the importance of proper safeguarding and reconciliation controls for assets held on behalf of clients.</span><span> </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Mion is available immediately and will be updated alongside AutoRek's regular release schedule to ensure clients benefit from ongoing platform enhancements.</span></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Issues Product Governance Guidelines To Promote Responsible Innovation And Strengthen Investor Protection</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-issues-product-governance-guidelines-to-promote-r-2025624/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-issues-product-governance-guidelines-to-promote-r-2025624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today introduced the Guidelines on Product Governance (PGG), aimed at strengthening investor protection as well as encouraging responsible product development and distribution in the capital market.</p>
<p>This initiative is part of the SC&rsquo;s market and regulatory reforms towards enhancing industry conduct and market integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among others, the PGG:</p>
<ul>
<li>requires product issuers and distributors (firms) to prioritise investors&rsquo; interests when designing and distributing unlisted capital market products, reflecting this in its controls, policies and procedures (CPPs);&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>requires firms to put in place CPPs that improve product suitability for the intended target market and proactively identify and prevent potential harm to investors;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>places greater emphasis on board and management&rsquo;s responsibilities by holding them accountable for product design and distribution; and</li>
<li>requires collaborative relationship between the product issuers and distributors to share information in respect of the appropriateness of target market to ensure the product continues to serve its intended purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said that the PGG reinforces the SC&rsquo;s efforts in promoting responsible product innovation and distribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PGG adopts a principle-based approach, allowing firms to implement their product governance framework that best suits their business model while still achieving its desired regulatory outcomes.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz said, is crucial in protecting investors&rsquo; interests and driving responsible innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By implementing an effective product governance framework, firms will also be able to demonstrate their commitment to ethical and responsible business practices, which is key to building trust in investors and regulators,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</p>

<title>Wealthbrix Launches In DIFC With Eight-Figure Investment Backing, Experienced Board, And A Commitment To Elevate Regional Wealth Management</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>Founded by senior bankers who helped shape the region&rsquo;s top institutions, Wealthbrix brings a track record managing over USD 30bn in AUM</span></li>
<li>Independent, senior-led firm offers a holistic, client-first model spanning private wealth, asset management, and corporate finance advisory</li>
</ul>
<p>Wealthbrix Capital Partners Limited, a newly launched independent wealth management firm, today announced its official market entry from Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial hub in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA region). Founded by a team of seasoned professionals from private banking and asset management, the firm brings together over 150 years of collective leadership experience and a track record managing more than USD 30bn in AUM from Middle Eastern, Asian, and European clients.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wealthbrix enters the market with a clear purpose: to deliver a client-first approach to wealth management that is independent, holistic, and agile - reflecting the ambitions of global upwardly mobile wealth creators and the shifting centre of gravity in global capital.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is the Dubai moment - an inflection point where global capital, regional ambition, and client expectations are converging,&rdquo; said<span>&nbsp;Dr. Hamad Buamim, Chairman of the Advisory Board, Wealthbrix Capital Partners Limited.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s wealth creators want more than access to products. They expect a partner who can build and preserve their legacy, support their ambitions, and provide unbiased, high-impact advice.&rdquo;<br /><br />This launch comes at a pivotal moment for wealth managers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cerulli.com/press-releases/cerulli-anticipates-124-trillion-in-wealth-will-transfer-through-2048">An estimated USD 85-100trn in global wealth</a>&nbsp;is expected to change hands by 2050 in what is being called the &lsquo;Great Wealth Transfer&rsquo; &ndash; including approximately USD 1trn in the GCC alone. This represents an unprecedented opportunity driven by next gen millionaires. This is juxtaposed by the UAE benefitting from this seismic shift, with more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/henley-private-wealth-migration-report-2024">6,700 new millionaires</a>&nbsp;having relocated to Dubai in 2024 alone, over 68,000 HNWIs and UHNWIs now based in the country, and more than 30,000 expected to arrive over the next five years, solidifying the UAE&rsquo;s status as a leading global hub for the new generation of high-net-worth individuals.<br /><br />A growing share of global capital is concentrated in two fast-expanding, high-growth segments:&nbsp;<a href="https://worldwealthreport.com/">Mid-Tier Millionaires (MTMs)</a>&nbsp;with investable assets between USD 5mn and USD 30mn, and UHNWIs with over USD 30mn. MTMs alone account&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citi.com/ventures/perspectives/pressrelease/investing-in-vega.html">for nearly USD 55trn in global wealth</a>&nbsp;and are growing faster than the broader HNWI population. Often self-made and globally mobile, many in this group sit between upper-tier affluent and ultra-high-net-worth tiers - requiring a more tailored and sophisticated approach than standardised models typically provide. Meanwhile, the UHNWI population is projected to surge by 38 per cent over the next five years, with Asia and the Middle East driving the fastest growth globally.</p>
<p>Together, MTMs and UHNWIs represent a rapidly expanding opportunity - one that sits at the heart of Wealthbrix&rsquo;s mission. These clients demand more than transactional advice; they seek a holistic approach that reflects their ambitions. This is where Wealthbrix steps in: bridging the gap between legacy models and modern client expectations through an independent platform that combines global structuring expertise with regional insight. Whether it&rsquo;s wealth preservation, succession, asset diversification, or fundraising, Wealthbrix is purpose-built to meet the needs of this influential and under-served segment.<br /><br />Wealthbrix builds on the momentum of a maturing wealth management landscape with a differentiated, partner-led model spanning private wealth, asset management, and corporate finance advisory. Fully licensed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and headquartered in DIFC, Wealthbrix is designed to complement and elevate the existing wealth management ecosystem - delivering tailored, unbiased advice anchored in institutional discipline and enabled by advanced technology.<br /><br /><span>Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority</span>, said: &ldquo;We welcome Wealthbrix to DIFC&rsquo;s growing ecosystem of firms shaping the future of wealth and asset management. As the city with the highest concentration of wealth in the region, DIFC continues to attract firms that bring confidence, innovation, and a broad range of perspectives to the sector. We look forward to supporting Wealthbrix growth as they contribute to the evolution of the region&rsquo;s wealth management landscape.&rdquo;<br /><br />As global asset managers flock to the UAE to tap into rising investor demand, Wealthbrix offers a differentiated, home-grown alternative - combining institutional discipline and strong in-house asset management capabilities across equities, fixed income, and real estate. As part of its long-term strategy, the firm is building a DIFC-based fund platform that aims to anchor investment activity locally, whilst aligning with the Dubai Economic Agenda to position Dubai at the forefront of innovation and economic growth.<br /><br />Wealthbrix enters the market as a well-capitalised institution, having closed an eight-figure USD equity funding round backed by a strategic group of global investors - including family offices, a venture capital firm, and angel investors from the region and beyond.

<title>ASIC Warns Industry And Consumers Of Share Sale Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following a spike in reports of stolen shares due to identity theft and an industry review, ASIC has updated guidance for Australian financial services (AFS) licensees about how they can reduce share sale fraud risks to their clients and business.</p>
<p>Share sale fraud is the fraudulent activity of a person who is not who they claim to be, selling or transferring shares that do not belong to them.</p>
<p>It can have devastating financial and emotional impacts on the lives of people who fall victim.</p>
<p>The updated Information Sheet 237&nbsp;<em>Protecting against share sale fraud&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/report-suspicious-activity/protecting-against-share-sale-fraud/" title="Protecting against share sale fraud">INFO 237</a>) includes observations on share sale fraud methods by bad actors and better practices for licensee prevention and detection.</p>
<p>The updates reflect findings from a recent ASIC-led industry review into AFS licensees&rsquo; client onboarding and verification practices, in addition to their share sale fraud detection practices.</p>
<p>AFS licensees that deal in securities have a critical role in preventing and detecting share sale fraud, both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, &lsquo;In the last four years, ASIC analysis has identified a seven-fold increase in the number of share sale fraud reports made by market intermediaries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are terrible stories out there, where in some cases entire investment portfolios are lost, and millions of dollars are involved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a tremendous emotional and financial impact for investors who fall victim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re calling on market intermediaries to step up and protect their customers by strengthening their share sale fraud prevention, detection and response practices.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Share sale fraud can happen to anyone, at any time, with unsuspecting investors having their accounts hacked, and shares sold or transferred to others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vigilance is key as share sale fraud is often difficult to detect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Investors should review their share portfolios regularly, be alert to suspicious transaction activity, turn on multi-factor authentication, and use passphrases, not passwords for your logins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>AFS licensee better practices for fraud prevention and detection are outlined in the updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/report-suspicious-activity/protecting-against-share-sale-fraud/" title="Protecting against share sale fraud">INFO 237</a>, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>being alert to possible use of stock images, fakes, forgeries, and independently verifying their authenticity when onboarding new clients</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>monitoring trading behaviour and conducting additional due diligence where trading is unusual for a client, a client makes large withdrawal requests or newly opened accounts are observed, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>conducting further due diligence when clients add or request changes to personal information such as postal/email addresses and bank accounts, including, where possible, checking that bank accounts are held in the client&rsquo;s name.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For further guidance on anti-scam practices, we also encourage AFS licensees to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s Report 761&nbsp;<em>Scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-761-scam-prevention-detection-and-response-by-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 761 Scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks">REP 761</a>)</li>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s Report 790&nbsp;<em>Anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-790-anti-scam-practices-of-banks-outside-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 790 Anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks">REP 790</a>), and </li>
<li>the use of digital ID services accredited under the&nbsp;<em>Digital ID Act 2024</em>&nbsp;to safely and securely verify people&rsquo;s identity online. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/">https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC has done significant recent work to help protect consumers from fraud and scams:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2021 and 2023, ASIC reviewed the<strong>&nbsp;banks</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; and what measures they had to protect their customers from scams&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-761-scam-prevention-detection-and-response-by-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 761 Scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks">REP 761</a>) and (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-790-anti-scam-practices-of-banks-outside-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 790 Anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks">REP 790</a>).</li>
<li>In 2024 and early 2025, ASIC looked at the&nbsp;<strong>superannuation industry</strong>. In January 2025, ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant wrote to superannuation trustees urging them to strengthen their anti-scam practices (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-calls-out-superannuation-trustees-for-weak-scam-and-fraud-practices/" title="ASIC calls out superannuation trustees for weak scam and fraud practices">ASIC calls out superannuation trustees for weak scam and fraud practices</a>).</li>
<li>Now, ASIC is supporting continued action and a co-ordinated response from&nbsp;<strong>market intermediaries&nbsp;</strong>including stockbrokers, following ASIC&rsquo;s fraud surveillance work last year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ASIC recommends for investors to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review your share portfolios regularly, regardless of whether they are issuer-sponsored holdings registered with share registries or held in share trading accounts with stockbrokers, so you&rsquo;re quicker to detect unauthorised activity.</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for suspicious activity when it comes to your share registry, share trading and bank accounts.</li>
<li>Use passphrases rather than simple passwords for online accounts.</li>
<li>Turn on multi-factor authentication &ndash; if it&rsquo;s available &ndash; as this can add an extra layer of security to protect your identity.</li>
<li>Lock your letterbox to prevent <a href="https://www.afp.gov.au/crimes/crimes-against-commonwealth-australia/postal-offences">mail theft</a> and check it frequently.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you believe you&rsquo;ve been targeted in a share sale fraud, immediate action is crucial:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Report the suspected suspicious activity to your market intermediary (i.e., online broker) and/or share registry.</li>
<li>Report your incident to the Australian Federal Police using their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/report">Report Cyber portal</a>, and specify you&rsquo;re a victim of share sale fraud in your report.</li>
<li>Also report the incident to the Australian Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scamwatch website</a>.</li>
<li>Contact&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idcare.org/">IDCARE</a>, a free government-funded service, which can help you develop a specific response plan if your identity has been compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where to go for more information</strong></p>

<title>CFTC’s Division Of Market Oversight Seeks Public Comment On Proposed No-Action Position To MIAX Futures Exchange, LLC</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftcs-division-of-market-oversight-seeks-public-comment-on-proposed-no-action-p-2025624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Division of Market Oversight (DMO) of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is seeking public comment on a proposed no-action position to&nbsp;<strong>MIAX Futures Exchange, LLC&nbsp;</strong>(MIAX Futures), a designated contract market (DCM), pursuant to Commission Regulation 140.99. Comments must be submitted by 12 p.m. EDT on June 25, 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>By letter dated June 23, 2025, MIAX Futures requested that DMO issue a letter stating that it will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission in connection with MIAX Futures&rsquo; temporary provision for the trading of Minneapolis Hard Red Spring Wheat (HRSW) options on futures (HRSW Options) exclusively through block trades. The requested relief is necessary due to the unavailability of an electronic trading system for the HRSW Options and is intended to allow market participants, including those who are not eligible contract participants (ECPs) as defined in section 1a(18) of the Commodity Exchange Act&nbsp;(CEA), to trade or offset open positions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MIAX Futures has proposed amendments to its rulebook, effective from June 30 through August 29, 2025, to: (i) permit block trading of HRSW Options outside of a centralized market; (ii) lower the block trade threshold for HRSW Options from 15 contracts to one contract; and (iii) permit non-ECPs to participate in block trades of HRSW Options. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to implement these rulebook amendments, MIAX Futures seeks no-action relief from DCM Core Principle 9, Commission Regulation 1.38, and CEA section 5c(c) and related regulations under Part 40. Staff proposes granting time-limited relief, as described in the proposed letter,&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB">to&nbsp;</span><span>reduce the risk of market disruption and to provide market participants additional time to manage or exit open positions in HRSW Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the novelty of MIAX Futures&rsquo; block-trade only proposal, DMO seeks public comment on the above issues.&nbsp;The abbreviated comment period is necessary to facilitate a timely decision in advance of the proposed June 30, 2025, trading date &ndash; when the current electronic trading system will cease to be available &ndash; if the requested relief is granted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Comments may be submitted electronically through the&nbsp;CFTC&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/CommentList.aspx?id=7597">online portal</a><span>. All comments will be posted on&nbsp;CFTC.gov. MIAX Futures&rsquo; request for a no-action position is available&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12421/MIAX-requestTimeLimitedRelief_06232025/download">here</a><span>. DMO&rsquo;s proposed no-action letter is available&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12416/MIAX-proposedNAL_06232025/download">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<title>Kevin Muhlendorf Named SEC Inspector General</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/kevin-muhlendorf-named-sec-inspector-general-2025623/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/kevin-muhlendorf-named-sec-inspector-general-2025623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Kevin Muhlendorf will be the agency&rsquo;s new Inspector General, effective July 28. Mr. Muhlendorf is a former SEC and Justice Department attorney who for the past nine years has been a partner in the white-collar defense and government investigations practice at Wiley Rein LLP in Washington D.C., where he focused on representing individuals and entities in criminal and civil securities enforcement matters. Acting Inspector General Katherine Reilly will return to her role as a Deputy Inspector General.</p>
<p>In private practice, Mr. Muhlendorf regularly conducted sensitive internal investigations and provided compliance counseling for clients. While on secondment from Wiley Rein for portions of 2023 and 2024, Mr. Muhlendorf served as Acting Inspector General for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), where he led approximately three dozen auditors and special agents conducting investigations and issuing financial and performance audits. He also designed and implemented a whistleblower award pilot program.</p>
<p>Since 2015, Mr. Muhlendorf has taught a class on financial fraud investigations as an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law. He is both a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) and Certified Compliance &amp; Ethics Professional (CCEP).</p>
<p>Mr. Muhlendorf&rsquo;s previous law enforcement experience includes six years as a Trial Attorney and Assistant Chief in the Securities and Financial Fraud Unit of the U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s Criminal Division, Fraud Section, where he investigated and tried complex fraud cases in jurisdictions across the country. Mr. Muhlendorf was a Senior Counsel in the SEC Enforcement Division from 2004 to 2010.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kevin has the ideal combination of experience in internal investigations, compliance programs, and law enforcement to hit the ground running as our new Inspector General and ensure our agency&rsquo;s operations are transparent, efficient, and effective,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;He is a proven leader &ndash; and former inspector general &ndash; with a reputation for fairness and objectivity, and we&rsquo;re pleased to welcome someone with his record of accomplishment back to the SEC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Muhlendorf said, &ldquo;The SEC is genuinely committed to its investor protection mission, and I&rsquo;m grateful for this opportunity to re-enter government service and help the Commission and its staff pursue that mission with efficiency and integrity while protecting taxpayer resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Muhlendorf began his legal career as a litigation associate at Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP after serving as a federal judicial law clerk to Judge John M. Facciola in Washington D.C. He earned his BA in history from the University of Virginia and his law degree from William &amp; Mary Law School.</p>
<p>Ms. Reilly, who has been serving as Acting Inspector General since May, will return to her role when Mr. Muhlendorf arrives in July.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want especially to thank Katherine for stepping up to serve as Acting Inspector General and continuing her efforts to make our Office of Inspector General as productive as possible. She is exceptionally qualified, and I am very pleased that she continues as part of our inspector general team,&rdquo; Chairman Atkins said.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General is an independent unit that promotes the integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s critical programs and operations through rigorous and objective oversight.</p>
<p>Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, inspectors general have a dual and independent reporting relationship to the Commission and Congress. Appointments are made without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations.</p>

<title>Welcoming Remarks, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At A Fed Listens Event Hosted By The Federal Reserve Bank Of New York, Schenectady, New York</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/welcoming-remarks-federal-reserve-governor-adriana-d-kugler-at-a-fed-listens-2025623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Williams. And thank you to everyone who took the time to join us here today to offer your feedback.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250623a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>It is my pleasure to be here in Albany, a region of the country that has been so critical to the growth of our nation's economy. One of the aspects I enjoy most about my job is having the opportunity to visit every region of the country and see how the economy is unfolding on the ground. I am happy to be able to do that again today.</p>
<p>The purpose of this&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>event, specifically, is to receive your input as part of the public review of our long-run goals and strategy for monetary policy. We call this document our framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250623a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last reviewed this important document in 2019&ndash;2020. At that time Committee members decided it was appropriate to complete a similar review every five years. The 2025 review consists of three elements: a research conference, discussions and deliberations at our policy meetings, and, very importantly,<em>&nbsp;Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events such as this. As Chair Powell said last month, in this review we are reconsidering aspects of our strategic framework in light of the experience of the last five years. I anticipate that consideration of changes to the framework, based on the information and perspectives gathered during this review, will be complete in coming months. As part of this process, I am paying particular attention to what we have learned about the economy in the past five years, and the way changes made in the last framework review were interpreted by the public. The Committee will also consider possible enhancements to the FOMC's policy communication tools.</p>
<p>But, of course, I enjoy hearing from the public on a regular basis, not just as part of our framework review. Obtaining that on-the-ground insight is an essential ingredient to my approach in making policy. As a Fed policymaker, who is also an academic economist, I am always analyzing data to better understand how the economy is developing. However, I feel strongly that it is best to add to that technical training by hearing from people across the country, people like you. I am proud to say that I have visited nearly every Fed District during my relatively short time on the Board, and I have plans to see the remaining Districts in the near future. It is important to hear from Americans for whom we make policy. I want to listen to the perspective of families considering significant purchases and employment decisions. I want to hear from business owners about investment and hiring plans. I want local leaders to tell me about how their communities are faring. This information matters greatly to me as a policymaker. I thank you for taking the time to share your stories.</p>
<p>Now the primary purpose of this event is for me and President Williams to listen to you, so I will stop here, and look forward to hearing from all of you. Thank you again.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Announces That Reputational Risk Will No Longer Be A Component Of Examination Programs In Its Supervision Of Banks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that reputational risk will no longer be a component of examination programs in its supervision of banks.</p>
<p>The Board has started the process of reviewing and removing references to reputation and reputational risk from its supervisory materials, including examination manuals, and, where appropriate, replacing those references with more specific discussions of financial risk. The Board will train examiners to help ensure this change is implemented consistently across Board-supervised banks and will work with the other federal bank regulatory agencies to promote consistent practices, as necessary.</p>
<p>This change does not alter the Board's expectation that banks maintain strong risk management to ensure safety and soundness and compliance with law and regulation nor is it intended to impact whether and how Board-supervised banks use the concept of reputational risk in their own risk management practices.</p>

<title>SIFMA, ISDA Comments On Stress Capital Buffer Requirement Proposal</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-isda-comments-on-stress-capital-buffer-requirement-proposal-2025623/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-isda-comments-on-stress-capital-buffer-requirement-proposal-2025623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc (ISDA) today submitted a comment letter on a proposal by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to revise its capital plan rule and stress capital buffer requirement (SCB).</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/modifications-to-the-capital-plan-rule-and-stress-capital-buffer-requirement-rin-7100-ag92-sifma-and-isda/">letter</a>, SIFMA and ISDA commend the Board for initiating efforts to address longstanding and unwarranted volatility of the SCB, primarily by averaging SCB results over a two-year period. However, the letter notes the proposal fails to address more fundamental drivers of SCB volatility, including the implausibility of the supervisory stress scenarios and the overlap with the risk-based capital framework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These core issues lead to SCBs that are not only excessively volatile but also not reflective of underlying risks,&rdquo; SIFMA and ISDA wrote in the letter. &ldquo;The combination of excessive volatility and miscalibration relative to underlying risks constrains large banking organizations&rsquo; capacity to intermediate the U.S. capital markets and support economic growth.&nbsp; As such, broader and more material reforms that address these fundamental issues are required to ensure the supervisory stress testing framework remains relevant and effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that end, the letter highlights the following key recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A banking organization should be permitted,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the 2025 stress testing cycle, to have its SCB requirements determined under the current SCB rule through September 30, 2026, regardless of whether the proposal is finalized with an effective date on or prior to October 1, 2026</span></span>. Additionally, the final rule&mdash;if it becomes effective January 1, 2026&mdash;should clarify that the SCB requirement effective through September 30, 2026, would apply through December 31, 2026.</li>
<li><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An asymmetric averaging approach should be adopted to determine the SCB requirement</span></span>. Asymmetric averaging of two-year supervisory stress test results would enable SCB requirements to adapt quickly to reduced risks and allow large banking organizations time to manage increased risks, resulting in efficient capital allocation.&nbsp; By contrast, simple averaging would not allow firms to deploy capital to the same extent in response to reduced risks, because the prior year&rsquo;s results, reflective of a higher-risk environment, would flow through into the current year&rsquo;s SCB.</li>
<li><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The dividend add-on component should be removed from supervisory stress tests</span></span>. The dividend add-on component is conceptually inconsistent with the maximum payout ratio requirement under the capital rules and should be removed from supervisory stress tests.</li>
<li><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The supervisory stress testing framework includes assumptions that are not consistent with post-crisis reforms or market practice.&nbsp;</span></span>The current supervisory stress testing framework, which dates to early 2009, does not account for the risk-mitigating benefits of these post-crisis financial reforms and strengthened risk management practices, while also relying on assumptions that often contradict the requirements of these reforms. As such, the current supervisory stress testing framework is conceptually incoherent with the broader post-crisis reforms and not fit-for-purpose.</li>
<li><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The supervisory stress testing framework is conceptually inconsistent with the RWA framework</span></span>. The current U.S. capital rules stipulate that large banking organizations must calculate certain RWAs to reflect stressed market conditions. As a result, stress losses arising from capital markets-related activities are captured by both the market risk and counterparty credit risk framework as well as the supervisory stress testing framework&rsquo;s GMS/LCD components.&nbsp; The U.S. Basel 3 Endgame proposal also would apply the SCB to the RWA framework, exacerbating the overlaps between the RWA framework and the supervisory stress testing framework.&nbsp; The Board should reform both the supervisory stress testing framework and the RWA framework to ensure their conceptual consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We are strongly committed to maintaining the safety and efficiency of U.S. financial markets and hope the Agencies implement our recommendations, which reflect the extensive knowledge and experience of market professionals within the Associations and our members,&rdquo; SIFMA and ISDA concluded in their letter. &ldquo;Our recommendations are designed to make the U.S. capital framework more risk sensitive to avoid the potential adverse consequences of the Proposal on financial markets, consumers, end-users and the economy more generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full comment letter expands on these issues in more detail and can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/modifications-to-the-capital-plan-rule-and-stress-capital-buffer-requirement-rin-7100-ag92-sifma-and-isda/">here</a>.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, launched today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA12-2121844265-4904_DP_on_integrated_reporting.pdf">discussion paper</a>&nbsp;to gather feedback and inputs on how to integrate funds reporting, aiming to reduce the burden for market participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Funds reporting in the asset management sector is now subject to significant fragmentation due to the coexistence of several reporting regimes at national and European level, resulting in high compliance burdens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>To identify solutions, the discussion paper outlines options for improving different aspects of reporting, such as the scope of data, reporting processes and systems to ensure more efficient reporting and sharing of data between the authorities. Among the possibilities, there are proposals related to the integration of multiple reporting templates and the centralisation of reporting processes and infrastructures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>This paper adds to ESMA&rsquo;s simplification and burden reduction initiative,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-contributes-simplification-and-burden-reduction">launched earlier this year</a><span>, and it is directly contributing to the debate on how to simplify, harmonise and eliminate barriers to produce an effective burden reduction in the financial sector, while preserving the main objectives of financial stability, orderly markets and investor protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESMA&rsquo;s actions mark a shift from technical sectorial amendments to an integrated approach in funds supervisory reporting, similar to the comprehensive approach to financial transaction reporting. The idea is to take a step back and review reporting in a more comprehensive manner rather than focusing on the incremental sectorial changes.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESMA welcomes input to support the assessment of the costs and benefits of the approaches presented in the discussion paper until 21 September 2025. This assessment will be performed following the consultation period, in cooperation with the relevant authorities and the conclusions and recommendations will be published in the final report, expected in April 2026.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;As the Federal Reserve's Vice Chair for Supervision, I am responsible for, among other things, leading the Board's Division of Supervision and Regulation in its work to promote the safe and sound operation of the U.S. banking system. While this includes the specific activities of bank supervision and regulation, the financial system reaches far beyond the banking system. Regulators must also monitor the effects of activities that extend outside this perimeter, for example activities that have migrated from banks to non-banks, or when there are broader market implications of regulatory actions and their potential effects on financial stability. Regulations should not be created in a static world of "set it and forget it."</p>
<p>Today, my remarks will focus specifically on how the passage of time&mdash;with underlying changes in the composition of the economy and the financial system, interest rate shifts, and patterns and preferences of banking and financial activity&mdash;can lead to unintended policy application and unexpected consequences. Regulators should consider these broader evolving dynamics as they craft regulations to endure beyond today's circumstances.</p>
<p>Typically, these effects are not contemplated in the scope of the usual cost-benefit analysis, as shifts occur over time after a new rule or regulation is implemented or enacted. But shifts can, in effect, become new policy choices with consequences that can pose significant issues.</p>
<p>One shift in particular is that of the supplementary leverage ratio increasingly becoming the binding capital constraint for the largest banks in the United States. The U.S. banking system includes two basic types of capital requirements: risk-based requirements that impose a capital "charge" based on the underlying risk of a particular activity, and leverage-based requirements that do not differentiate based on the risk characteristics of underlying assets. And while leverage-based capital requirements are generally intended to operate as a backstop to risk-based requirements, changes in the financial system and the broader economy can alter this relationship between capital requirements. This shift in the nature of leverage-based capital requirements, from backstop to binding constraint, was not driven by a deliberate policymaking process, but rather by the maintenance of a high level of reserves in the banking system, as well as the introduction of liquidity requirements that compelled banks to replace loans with high-quality liquid assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy and Economic Outlook</span><br />Before turning to the main theme of my remarks, I would like to give a brief update on my outlook for the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week, the Committee voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. I supported this decision because the data shows a solid labor market and I would like to see further confirmation that inflation is close to our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.</p>
<p>If inflation remains near its current level or continues to move closer to our target, or if the data show signs of weakening in labor market conditions, it would be appropriate to consider lowering the policy rate, moving it closer to a neutral setting.</p>
<p>At this point, we have not seen significant economic impacts from trade developments or other factors, and the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient despite some slowing in economic growth. Private domestic final purchases (PDFP) growth slowed to a moderate pace in the first quarter, even as activity was partly boosted by a pull-forward of spending on motor vehicles and high-tech equipment ahead of the implementation of tariffs. Although the pull-forward of spending appears to be unwinding, retail and motor vehicle sales through May provide further evidence that PDFP has softened so far this year.</p>
<p>The labor market appears to remain solid, with payroll employment rising about 140,000 per month, on average, in April and May, only slightly below the average monthly gains over the past two quarters. This pace of job gains appears consistent with the unemployment rate remaining at a low 4.2 percent through May, which is roughly unchanged since the middle of last year.</p>
<p>The labor market appears to be stable near estimates of full employment, with layoffs remaining low. The number of job openings relative to job seekers has moved roughly sideways since the middle of last year at, or a touch below, the pre-pandemic level. And the labor market no longer appears to be especially tight or a significant source of inflation pressures, as most wage growth measures have slowed closer to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation.</p>
<p>Turning to inflation, we have seen a welcome return to further moderation of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation over the past three months. The May consumer and producer price reports suggest that 12-month core PCE inflation stood at 2.6 percent in May, down meaningfully from its elevated reading of 2.9 percent at the end of last year. Similar to the past two years, elevated monthly inflation readings in January and February have been followed by low readings as we move into the spring.</p>
<p>On a 12-month basis, core PCE goods inflation has picked up somewhat since last December, but this has been more than offset by a considerable slowing in core PCE services inflation. It appears that any upward pressure from higher tariffs on goods prices is being offset by other factors and that the underlying trend in core PCE inflation is moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently apparent in the data. With housing services inflation on a sustained downward trajectory, and other core services inflation already consistent with 2 percent inflation, only core goods inflation remains somewhat elevated likely reflecting limited passthrough from tariffs.</p>
<p>With economic growth slowing, it is possible that recent softness in aggregate demand could be starting to translate into weaker labor market conditions. While still strong, the labor market appears to be less dynamic, with modest hiring rates, layoffs edging up from low levels, and job gains concentrated in just a few industries. With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should put more weight on downside risks to our employment mandate going forward.</p>
<p>Despite progress on lowering inflation, there are potential upside risks if negotiations result in higher tariffs or if firms raise goods prices independent of any tariff pass-through. Although we have not seen evidence of disruptive impacts on supply chains, changes in global trade patterns could lead to an increase in prices for goods and services. The current conflict in the Middle East or other geopolitical tensions could also lead to higher commodity prices.</p>
<p>I am certainly attentive to these inflation risks, but I am not yet seeing a major concern, as some retailers seem unwilling to raise prices for essentials due to high price sensitivity among low-income consumers and as supply chains appear to be largely unaffected so far.</p>
<p>Measures of policy and economic uncertainty have receded from recent highs, and measures of consumer and business sentiment have also improved in recent weeks after having dropped considerably. These developments reinforce my view that concerns will subside as more clarity emerges on trade policy. Businesses appear to be resuming investment and hiring decisions, as they feel increasingly confident that less favorable trade outcomes are unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>I remain focused on how new policies evolve and whether future data releases will provide perspective about their economic impacts. On trade policy, I expect that negotiations will ultimately result in lower tariff rates than are currently in place, consistent with the resumption of financial market optimism. Further, should we see effects on inflation this year, I expect that increased slack in the economy will limit this to a small, one-off impact.</p>
<p>Small and one-off price increases this year should translate only into a small drag on real activity. I also expect that less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more friendly business environment will likely boost supply and largely offset any negative effects on economic activity and prices.</p>
<p>In considering the risks to achieving our dual mandate, I fully supported the revised characterization of uncertainty and the balance of risks in our most recent monetary policy statement, pointing to the diminished uncertainty and removing the emphasis on risks to both sides of our mandate. In my view, it was appropriate to recognize that the balance of risks has shifted. In fact, the data have not shown clear signs of material impacts from tariffs and other policies. I think it is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed, and have a smaller effect than initially expected, especially because many firms front-loaded their stocks of inventories. And, all considered, ongoing progress on trade and tariff negotiations has led to an economic environment that is now demonstrably less risky. The change in our monetary policy statement appropriately incorporates this shift in the balance of risks as well as the rapid improvement in many measures of uncertainty.</p>
<p>As we think about the path forward, it is time to consider adjusting the policy rate. As inflation has declined or come in below expectations over the past few months, we should recognize that inflation appears to be on a sustained path toward 2 percent and that there will likely be only minimal impacts on overall core PCE inflation from changes to trade policy. We should also recognize that downside risks to our employment mandate could soon become more salient, given recent softness in spending and signs of fragility in the labor market.</p>
<p>Before our next meeting in July, we will have received one additional month of employment and inflation data. If upcoming data show inflation continuing to evolve favorably, with upward pressures remaining limited to goods prices, or if we see signs that softer spending is spilling over into weaker labor market conditions, such developments should be addressed in our policy discussions and reflected in our deliberations. Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting in order to bring it closer to its neutral setting and to sustain a healthy labor market. In the meantime, I will continue to carefully monitor economic conditions as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets continue to evolve.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook, guided by the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>Bringing inflation in line with our price-stability goal is essential for sustaining a healthy labor market and fostering an economy that works for everyone in the longer run.</p>
<p><span>Policy Shifts and Unintended Consequences</span><br />In my responsibilities over bank regulation and supervision at the Federal Reserve, I intend to apply a pragmatic approach. We will review data and evidence, identify problems that need to be resolved, and develop efficient solutions to address those identified issues.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;While the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve is primarily related to the banking system, the&nbsp;<em>consequences</em>&nbsp;of banking regulation and supervisory efforts are not limited to the banking system. Bank regulation and supervision affect how financial activities are conducted, the cost and availability of credit and financial services, and even what types of entities provide those services. While it is important to consider the consequences of regulatory actions as they evolve over time, in cases where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we must examine whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.</p>
<p>Bank-affiliated broker-dealers play a critical role in U.S. capital markets, including in Treasury market intermediation activities. Today I will discuss the lessons we have learned about how bank regulatory requirements, specifically leverage ratios in the United States, can have unintended consequences. Leverage ratio impacts on bank-affiliated broker-dealers can have broader impacts, including market impacts like those observed in Treasury market intermediation activities. Once we've identified "emerging" unintended consequences&mdash;issues that were not contemplated during the development of a regulatory approach&mdash;we must consider how to revisit earlier regulatory and policy decisions.</p>
<p>As I will discuss in greater detail shortly, regulators must act quickly to address the growing problems with increasingly binding leverage ratios. In 2021, in connection with the expiration of temporary, emergency changes to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), the Federal Reserve committed to "soon" inviting public comment on potential modifications.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Over four years later, a proposal has not been issued, and problems with Treasury market intermediation continue to emerge. The time has come for the federal banking agencies to revisit leverage ratios and their impacts on the Treasury markets.</p>
<p><span>Looking at the Data: Treasury Market Functioning</span><br />As a first step in this pragmatic approach, it is important to look at what the data says about Treasury market functioning. This is a necessary first step before we determine whether there are issues or problems that can be addressed through adjustments to bank regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>A review of Treasury market data provides a history of growing issues with Treasury market functioning. In recent years, U.S. policy debates have highlighted the need to take preventative measures to ensure smooth market functioning. One issue that continues to persist is low levels of Treasury market liquidity as the Board's semiannual&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report&nbsp;</em>noted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;In addition, some dealers experienced balance sheet pressure in intermediating record volumes of Treasury market transactions in the spring, at a time when reports from market participants also indicated reduced demand from other Treasury investors.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>A survey of market participants from the Fed's most recent&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;noted that more than a quarter of respondents cited Treasury market functioning as a risk to the U.S. financial system and the broader global economy. This was an increase from the same survey conducted last fall when 17 percent of those surveyed cited Treasury market functioning as a risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>Recent changes to Treasury market clearing activities from the Securities and Exchange Commission's central clearing requirement for U.S. Treasuries were implemented to improve Treasury market functioning. Once fully implemented, these changes may improve market functioning. The Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility may also help to promote smooth functioning in the Treasury market. But it is unclear how the ongoing increases in the volume of Treasury issuance, the volume of Treasury securities outstanding, and changes to the Fed's balance sheet over time, may also affect market liquidity.</p>
<p>Treasury markets have experienced stress events as recently as the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called "dash for cash" in March of 2020. In early April, we also saw strains in Treasury cash markets. Although markets continued to function, there were unexpected moves in Treasury yields, with an initial drop in yields followed by a sharp increase that seems to have been driven in part by the unwinding of the swap spread trade by leveraged investors in response to declining swap spreads.</p>
<p>We do not know exactly what circumstances may lead to a future stress event or how it will manifest, and continuing to impose unwarranted limits on dealers' intermediation capacity could exacerbate a future stress event in this critical market. But we do know that these events have raised concerns about the resilience of U.S. Treasury markets. Therefore, we should continue to actively monitor indicators of market functioning. Recent trends in both market liquidity indicators and survey responses suggest that this problem has persisted and may be becoming more severe. Low liquidity can create more volatility in prices, exacerbate the effects of market shocks, and threaten market functioning.</p>
<p><span>Identifying the Problem: Looking Beyond Treasury Market Intermediation</span><br />Large bank-affiliated primary dealers play a vital role in the intermediation of U.S. Treasury markets. These dealers are subject to, not insulated from, the effect of banking regulation. While many factors can affect market liquidity, including the growing volume of Treasury issuance, Treasury market saturation, and interest rate volatility, we must consider whether some of the pressure is a byproduct of bank regulation. Due to the role of large banks in the intermediation of Treasury markets, there is a direct link between banking regulation and Treasury market liquidity, particularly when it comes to the growth of "safe" assets in the banking system and the increase in leverage-based capital requirements becoming the binding capital constraint on some large banks. In 2018, the Federal Reserve along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed significant changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) that applies to the largest banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;These revisions were never finalized, but the intent behind them was to return the eSLR to its traditional role as a backstop capital requirement instead of what has become a substantial balance sheet constraint.</p>
<p>The proposed change was designed to promote resilience in the banking system and to protect financial stability, while also maximizing credit availability and economic growth throughout the credit cycle.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve addressed constraints on the ability of U.S. banks to support efficient Treasury market functioning by temporarily excluding Fed reserves and Treasuries from the denominator of the SLR.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>The central role of bank-affiliated broker-dealers in Treasury market intermediation has led us to take a close look at bank regulatory requirements to clarify how these requirements, particularly their calibration, may impact Treasury market functioning. Although designed to address low risk activities, like Treasury market intermediation, leverage ratios have become increasingly binding as a bank capital constraint as market conditions change.</p>
<p>While issues around the use of leverage ratios require close examination, a solid capital foundation in the banking system is critical to support safety and soundness and financial stability. Revisiting the calibration of leverage ratios to ensure that they remain backstops instead of creating binding constraints, especially in times of stress, should not be interpreted as a critique of the role of capital in a robust regulatory and supervisory framework.</p>
<p>But to be clear, the&nbsp;<em>consequences&nbsp;</em>of an overly restrictive leverage ratio go well beyond just Treasury market intermediation, and impact a wide range of low-risk activities. Leverage capital requirements do not differentiate between the risk of different asset classes or exposures.</p>
<p>However, in periods when bank balance sheets are expanding&mdash;like the significant deposit inflows during COVID-19&mdash;leverage capital requirements can unintentionally become the binding constraint on both banks and their affiliates. This increases the amount of required capital as bank balance sheets grow, regardless of the underlying risk. When constrained in this way, bank-affiliated primary dealers may pull back on the market intermediation of low-risk assets like U.S. Treasuries. A binding leverage capital requirement can create perverse incentives for banks to shift their balance sheets into higher risk assets, since doing so could generate larger returns without requiring additional capital. This is simply a cause and effect of overly restrictive leverage capital.</p>
<p>The fact of leverage ratios becoming increasingly binding is evident in simple metrics like the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total leverage exposure. These are, respectively, the denominators of risk-based capital ratios and the SLR. Shortly after the SLR was adopted in the U.S. in the mid-2010s, this ratio stood at 48 percent in the aggregate for the eight largest U.S. banks, the global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Since then, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total leverage exposure has declined and currently stands at 40 percent, primarily due to higher reserves and other types of high-quality liquid assets on bank balance sheets. This downward trend results in the SLR increasingly becoming the binding constraint and reflects banks' growing holdings of high-quality liquid assets, most of which carry a risk weight of zero under&nbsp;<em>risk-based</em>&nbsp;capital ratios but have a 100 percent weighting under&nbsp;<em>leverage</em>&nbsp;capital ratios.</p>
<p><span>Efficient Solutions</span><br />One example of the SLR's unintended consequence is the erosion of liquidity in U.S. Treasury markets because it is driven, in part, by leverage ratio requirements increasingly becoming the binding constraints on the largest U.S. banks. This example also illustrates the necessity of evaluating tradeoffs in regulation and speaks to a larger issue with the calibration of leverage.</p>
<p>The banking regulators are uniquely positioned to both analyze and remediate components of the bank regulatory framework that may disrupt banks' participation in low-risk, but economically critical activities. This includes the exacerbation of Treasury market illiquidity. Treasury markets play a critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems, and we should be proactive in addressing the unintended consequences of bank regulation, while ensuring the framework continues to promote safety, soundness, and financial stability.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250623a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;We should start by addressing potential constraints on Treasury market functioning before issues arise, lessening impacts from stress, and mitigating the need to intervene in future market events.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Board is scheduled to consider specific amendments to the eSLR, which is the requirement that applies at both the holding company and bank levels of the largest U.S. banks. While I do not want to front-run the proposal, I will note that the proposal's goal is to address a long-identified&mdash;and growing&mdash;problem with the calibration of this leverage requirement. The proposal would solicit public comment on the impacts of this miscalibration, potential fixes, and work to develop an appropriate and effective solution. This proposal takes a first step toward what I view as long overdue follow-up to review and reform what have become distorted capital requirements. This proposal, while meaningful, addresses only one element of the capital framework. More work on capital requirements remains, especially to consider how they have evolved and whether changes in market conditions have revealed issues that should be addressed.</p>
<p>In a few weeks, on July 22, the Federal Reserve will host a conference to bring together a wide range of thought leaders to discuss the U.S. bank capital framework, including the design and calibration of leverage ratios. Fixing the design and calibration of leverage capital requirements will not resolve every issue with U.S. Treasury market functioning. But, simple reforms to return leverage ratio requirements to their traditional role as a capital backstop could improve Treasury market functioning by building resilience in advance of future stress events. And this could reduce the chances that we would need to intervene in Treasury markets should a future stress event arise. While we know well the issues created by the eSLR, there are many potential improvements that could address other issues within the capital framework.</p>
<p>As I have noted previously, a broader set of reforms could include amending not only the leverage capital ratio, but also G-SIB surcharge requirements. We should also reconsider capital requirements for a wider range of banks, including the SLR's application to banks with more than $250 billion in assets, Tier 1 leverage requirements, and the calibration of the community bank leverage ratio.</p>
<p>The unintended shift over time in the eSLR increasingly becoming a binding capital constraint demonstrates that we need to think about regulatory policies in a dynamic way based on the evolution in the banking and financial systems, and the broader economy.</p>
<p>Other examples of regulations that must take into account the impact of economic growth and inflation include elements of the G-SIB surcharge, as well as regulatory thresholds that define the broader categories of banks. Thresholds like the $10 billion definition of a "community bank" and the $700 billion in total assets and $75 billion for cross-jurisdictional activity separating Category II and III banks determine which regulatory requirements apply to each group.</p>
<p>One way to prevent the original calibration from becoming divorced from the foundational policy decisions over time is to index the relevant G-SIB surcharge coefficients and regulatory thresholds to nominal gross domestic product. While approaches like indexing thresholds and requirements can make our regulations more robust and durable over time, we should also acknowledge the essential role of supervision as a tool to promote safety and soundness, and financial stability. Just as our capital requirements are intended to operate in a complementary manner, so do regulation and supervision act in a complementary way.</p>
<p>These are only a handful of relevant examples, but they are representative of an effective approach to regulatory reform. Regulations should not be created in a static world of "set it and forget it." The economy evolves over time, as do the banking and financial systems and the needs of businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>Increasingly, regulators are expected to conduct a more thorough and detailed analysis as part of the ordinary rulemaking process, which includes a proposal's costs and benefits. Yet, over time, we tend to devote fewer resources to the work of conducting maintenance of our regulations. Maintenance of the regulatory system should include reviewing the basis for earlier policy decisions, considering whether the policies embedded in regulations have been distorted over time through market developments, and examining whether emerging issues in the market should lead to further review and revision.</p>
<p><span>Closing Thoughts</span><br />Thank you for the opportunity to join you today and to provide my views on the U.S. economic outlook and current regulatory proposals. In the United States, regulatory policy objectives are prescribed by law, and bank regulators focus primarily on promoting the safe and sound operation of U.S. banks, and financial stability. Despite this limited purpose, we must understand the consequences of regulations, which can extend well beyond the banking system. Recent trends&mdash;including providing more fact-based and analytical support for proposals&mdash;are a positive step in achieving responsible regulation.</p>
<p>But we need a broad commitment to follow the approach I have just described. We must consider relevant data and information, identify the source of any problems or opportunity for greater efficiency, and then develop targeted and effective policy solutions and approaches.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>MTCM, a Luxembourg-based securitization platform serving clients across Europe (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLislnjbAvfmfEK-2FN0mlvPheA-3D_QW5_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ7BEdr6qktDXSgp-2FyMgspBMiKZaP7HqCwrNGmDQ7Pc6v69-2BCDcxHifX2vxoCBgqPnpDIkLjQBoPw1jTGrxcjPqj6v4HtbLVuSKRITtKqiOBS-2FrcdDg-2FjmmzXkMl9PTUqo-2FUy-2BuZtQtf92NkPP3YYR4Ce-2Bv17cVM85MFdeZPhYDgekixmYx23k7c7IE8hsCJa6l5-2BnREF62HOdQ-2FNexkN4oD2RYwPSWS-2B-2FHu7UiiqeGUWFhWRgcyIUjjWR7DBx-2FkUOGkfFlqjqRY11ysHIGxGc-2FUUhmvXUdwWaHaxPtOCcRHI-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.mtcm.ch</a>), the Americas, MENA, and Asia, has entered into a strategic partnership with Tokeny, the leading onchain operating system, to enable the issuance of both traditional and digital securities through a unified workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This collaboration marks the launch of the first dual-format issuance framework in Luxembourg, where an ISIN-listed note and a permissioned security token are minted simultaneously from the same legal compartment, ensuring full fungibility and compliance across both formats.</p>
<p>Pedro Herranz, Managing Partner at MTCM, commenced: "The partnership with Tokeny allows us to industrialize a dual-issuance model that was previously not possible. We now produce a fungible twin issuance: one leg as an ISIN-listed note settled via a leading international CSD, the other as ERC-3643-based permissioned tokenized notes onchain. This structure enables investors and arrangers to choose between blockchain or traditional settlement, without compromising on compliance, operational efficiency, or investor protections."</p>
<p>Luc Falempin, CEO of Tokeny, added: "The dual issuance model is a practical way to help traditional investors get familiar with the onchain format. Once they try these assets, which are faster to settle, easier to access, and enhanced with features that weren't possible before, they will naturally prefer the modernized and better way to access, manage, and transfer securities. This would definitely accelerate the demands from buy sides and drive the adoption."</p>
<p>Under a white-label integration, Tokeny's T-REX tokenization platform has been embedded into MTCM's comprehensive end-to-end solutions. While MTCM acts as structurer, administrator and calculation agent, Tokeny provides easy-to-use interfaces to all stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration is now live and supports the full lifecycle of a digital issuance, from onboarding and KYC to subscription and secondary solutions, within MTCM's white-labeled investor portal. Tokeny's technology simplifies complex workflows, embedding digital identity, AML/KYC verification, wallet integration, and cap table management into a single interface, reducing onboarding friction and improving transparency for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>This model significantly improves access, speed, and cost efficiency in structured finance. Institutional and professional investors can now self-custody digital securities, bypassing the high distribution and custodian costs typically associated with structured notes. For arrangers, this hybrid issuance opens up a wider distribution universe, combining reach through the traditional investors with new and blockchain-native investor segments.</p>
<p>With over &euro;2.5 billion in assets under service and a 400% increase in AUS over the past two years, MTCM continues to expand its global footprint and lead innovation in hybrid financial structuring.</p>
<p>By merging the benefits of capital markets infrastructure with onchain efficiency, MTCM and Tokeny are redefining how structured investments are issued, distributed, and managed in a multi-rail financial future.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, today announced plans to launch a new Fiserv digital asset platform, including a new stablecoin (FIUSD) that will be added to Fiserv&rsquo;s existing banking and payments infrastructure by the end of the year.</p>
<p>FIUSD presents Fiserv customers with access to a new, more efficient, and interoperable digital asset service for their banking and payment flows. Offering FIUSD across the company&rsquo;s global multi-sided network, which includes relationships with approximately 10,000 financial institution clients and six million merchant locations processing 90 billion transactions annually, will provide instant scale for FIUSD while creating a digital asset network that clients can use to build new products and services. Fiserv plans to enable FIUSD through existing Fiserv technology at no additional cost to clients.</p>
<p>FIUSD expects to use stablecoin infrastructure from Paxos and Circle Internet Group, Inc. (NYSE: CRCL) &ndash; with the intention of making it interoperable with several leading stablecoins, and it will be available to Fiserv clients via Solana, one of the most trusted and used blockchains for stablecoins. In addition, the company is exploring the use of deposit tokens to maintain the benefits of stablecoins in a more capital-friendly structure for banks. Fiserv is active in discussions with other potential partners to further expand use cases for stablecoins and tokenized deposits, both in the United States and internationally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through our privileged position as a trusted infrastructure provider to financial institutions, merchants, and their customers worldwide, we are relentlessly focused on delivering state-of-the-art innovation, efficiency, and choice to all of our partners,&rdquo; said Takis Georgakopoulos, Chief Operating Officer, Fiserv. &ldquo;With our scale, reach, and technology leadership, Fiserv is uniquely positioned to advance stablecoin-powered payments and help democratize access to blockchain financial services. Together with our other cloud-native banking and merchant platforms, we believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Offering the programmability of blockchain with the stability and trust of fiat currency, the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits in traditional banking and payments is expected to rapidly expand due to their ability to settle 24/7, streamline processes, increase efficiency, and power use cases where existing options may be limited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxos is excited to partner with Fiserv to power FIUSD with our proven, globally regulated stablecoin issuance and payments platform,&rdquo; said Walter Hessert, Head of Strategy at Paxos. &ldquo;As the most regulated stablecoin provider with a proven track record at enterprise scale, our industry-leading platform&mdash;combined with Fiserv&rsquo;s extensive network&mdash;will enable instant, borderless, and compliant payment solutions for banks and institutions worldwide. This partnership clearly demonstrates how Paxos&rsquo;s stablecoin infrastructure is becoming the foundation for modern financial services, advancing our shared mission to deliver open, compliant digital financial tools to institutions and users everywhere."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiserv is a global powerhouse in commerce, and Circle is a global fintech firm and stablecoin market leader,&rdquo; said Heath Tarbert, President at Circle. &ldquo;Together, we will work to unlock the next frontier of money movement &ndash; embedding stablecoins into everyday commerce and making money move as easily, reliably, and instantly as sending an email.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>A Bank-Friendly Coin</span></p>
<p>Like other Fiserv solutions, FIUSD enables financial institutions to maintain full control of their customer experience. Delivered through an easy-to-integrate Software Development Kit (SDK), it fits into existing Fiserv customer-facing platforms like Experience Digital and Commercial Center. FIUSD will enable compliance through existing built-in features such as fraud monitoring, risk management, and settlement controls.</p>
<p>Fiserv&rsquo;s new digital asset platform will leverage its Finxact core processing platform as the underlying ledger and will be connected to our latest cloud-native orchestration, payments, and banking platforms, creating an interoperable, end-to-end fiat and digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FIUSD is designed with our clients in mind, a financial institution-friendly coin that simplifies stablecoin access through a secure and scalable ecosystem,&rdquo; said Sunil Sachdev, Head of Embedded Finance at Fiserv. &ldquo;We are excited to begin collaborating with our clients, partners, and other ecosystem players to create modernized financial experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the first in a series of announcements that Fiserv will be making with partners on its new digital asset platform.</p>

<title>NGX Group Chairman Calls For Regional Collaboration To Unlock West Africa’s Trade And Investment Potential At WAES 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>The Group Chairman of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, has called for stronger regional cooperation to harness the untapped potential of West Africa&rsquo;s trade and commodity markets. Speaking at the inaugural West Africa Economic Summit (WAES) 2025 held under the theme &ldquo;Unlocking Trade and Investment Opportunities in the Region&rdquo;, Dr. Kwairanga highlighted the critical role of capital markets and commodity exchanges in transforming the region&rsquo;s abundant natural resources into organized, transparent capital that fuels industrialization and inclusive economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>Delivering remarks during a high-level panel on &ldquo;Commodities as Capital: Regional Commodities Exchange &amp; Reserves&rdquo;, Dr. Kwairanga noted that despite West Africa&rsquo;s wealth of raw materials, the region continues to face a paradox of resource abundance coexisting with capital scarcity. &ldquo;As a nation and region, we are abundantly rich in raw materials, but often poor in capital outcomes. This paradox is not due to lack of resources, but due to the way these resources have historically been excluded from structured financial ecosystems. Commodities, whether agricultural, mineral, or energy, must be seen not just as tradeable goods, but as investable assets capable of powering industrialization, job creation, and macroeconomic stability,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>Dr. Kwairanga emphasized NGX Group&rsquo;s commitment to building resilient market infrastructure that supports price discovery, clearing, settlement, and investor protection, systems that can underpin thriving regional commodity markets. He highlighted NGX Group&rsquo;s role in mobilizing capital for commodity value chains through IPOs, bonds, and structured funds, citing the success of NGX-listed companies like Presco and Okomu Oil as models for attracting long-term investment.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>On the question of regional versus national commodity exchanges, Dr. Kwairanga advocated for a dual approach that combines the strengths of national platforms with the scale and integration benefits of regional frameworks. &ldquo;National exchanges address local needs and build depth, but for West Africa to unlock the full potential of commodity trade, we must connect these markets under a regional structure. Regulatory harmonization will be key, and this is where NGX Group&rsquo;s experience in governance, coupled with platforms like the African Exchanges Linkage Project and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, can help align standards and enable seamless cross-border transactions,&rdquo; he stated.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>Addressing liquidity challenges, Dr. Kwairanga outlined the need for harmonized rules, trustworthy infrastructure, product innovation, and incentives to drive participation. He called for public-private partnerships and regional integration to deepen market liquidity and ensure efficient price discovery.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>Beyond the panel discussions, Dr. Kwairanga commended the vision of President Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR and the Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Yusuf Maitama Tuggar OON for spearheading the summit. &ldquo;There is power in unity and prestige in size. The great economic powerhouses of the 21st century, such as the United States and China have risen to prominence partly because of the scale of their markets. A united West Africa can achieve the same if we work together on initiatives like this,&rdquo; he said, expressing optimism that the summit would produce actionable frameworks to reduce trade barriers, encourage regional investment, and fast-track economic growth across ECOWAS.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>NGX Group, he added, remains committed to supporting cross-border investments, citing its participation in the African Exchanges Linkage Project and the increasing regional footprint of NGX-listed companies such as Dangote Cement, First Bank, Zenith Bank, Access Bank, and Ecobank.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-xmsonormal"><span>The summit brought together key stakeholders from across West Africa to deliberate on strategies for accelerating regional integration, strengthening capital markets, and unlocking the full potential of intra-African trade.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its May 2025 ICE First Look, which shows that delinquencies and foreclosure activity continues to trend slightly higher on an annual basis despite some seasonal and disaster recovery related improvement.</p>
<p>The ICE First Look reports on month-end delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment statistics sourced from its loan-level database, which covers a majority of the U.S. mortgage market. Key takeaways from this month&rsquo;s findings include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The national delinquency rate ticked down 2 basis points (bps) to 3.20% in May, though it is up 5.2% (16 bps) year over year (YoY).</li>

<li>Disaster-related delinquencies also improved, with those related to the 2024 hurricane season falling by nearly 5K (26%) month over month (MoM) and Los Angeles wildfire-related delinquencies falling by a more modest 9% MoM.</li>
<li>For the third consecutive month, foreclosure starts, active foreclosures and foreclosure sales rose annually as VA foreclosure resumptions continue to make their way through the pipeline.</li>
<li>Prepayment activity, as measured by single month mortality, inched up to 0.71%, the highest level since October 2024, driven by a seasonal rise in home sale-related prepayments. Prepayments were up 23.4% YoY.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Data as of May 31, 2025<br /></span>Total U.S. loan delinquency rate (loans 30 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure): 3.20%<br />Month-over-month change: -0.52%<br />Year-over-year change: 5.20%</p>

<title>Amrize Lists On SIX Swiss Exchange</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/amrize-lists-on-six-swiss-exchange-2025623/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/amrize-lists-on-six-swiss-exchange-2025623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Amrize Ltd (&ldquo;AMRZ&rdquo;) made its trading debut on SIX Swiss Exchange today, following its successful 100% spin-off from Holcim as an independent, publicly traded North American market leader in building solutions. At an opening price of CHF 46.00 per share, the resulting market capitalization of Amrize was around CHF 26 billion.</span></p>
<p>Amrize shares commenced trading under the ticker symbol &ldquo;AMRZ&rdquo; this morning with the market opening shortly after 09:00am CEST on SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich, Switzerland, and will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), USA, today.</p>
<p>The 100% spin-off is completed via the distribution of a dividend-in-kind of one Amrize share for every Holcim share owned as of the close of business on 20 June 2025. The transaction was approved by Holcim shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 14 May 2025.</p>
<p>Amrize has been added to the Swiss Market Index (SMI) and the Swiss Leader Index (SLI) on its first day of trading until at least 19 September 2025, the implementation date of the annual index review of SIX. During this period and similar to previous spin-off cases, no other changes to the Swiss blue-chips indices shall occur. Holcim will remain included in the SMI and SLI via ticker symbol &ldquo;HOLN&rdquo; and therefore, the SMI and SLI indices will temporarily have 21 and 31 constituents, respectively.</p>
<p>Amrize is building North America, as the partner of choice for professional builders with advanced branded solutions from foundation to rooftop. With over 1,000 sites and a highly efficient distribution network, Amrize delivers for its customers in every U.S. State and Canadian province. Its 19,000 teammates uniquely serve every construction market from infrastructure, commercial and residential to new build, repair and refurbishment. The company&rsquo;s operational headquarters are located in Chicago, USA, with its registered office based in Zug, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Jan Jenisch, Chairman and CEO of Amrize, commented: &ldquo;This is an exciting day for all our teammates as we begin our journey together as Amrize. As an independent, publicly traded company, Amrize will capitalize on North America&rsquo;s attractive construction market driven by long term mega-trends from infrastructure modernization and onshoring of manufacturing to data center expansion and the opportunity to bridge the housing gap. With our track record of profitable growth, market-leading operations and broad range of advanced building solutions, we are ideally positioned to be the partner of choice for the professional builders of North America and to unlock value for all stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tomas Kindler, Head Exchanges and Executive Board Member at SIX, emphasized: &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Amrize to SIX Swiss Exchange. The dual listing reflects our role as a global capital market hub and reinforces Switzerland&rsquo;s importance as a location for internationally active companies. We congratulate the entire Amrize team on this milestone and wish them every success as a stand-alone publicly listed company going forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago, sustainability was still a niche topic on the capital markets; today, it is an indispensable part of modern investment strategies. The V&Ouml;NIX index has reflected this development from the very beginning and proves that responsible investing is here to stay. The 20th anniversary is a strong sign of the Austrian companies' sustainability and the foresight of the local economy,"&nbsp;explains Andreas Zakostelsky, Chairman of the V&Ouml;NIX Advisory Board and CEO of VBV.</p>
<p>"With the inclusion of Burgenland Holding AG, Austria's leading wind power producer is now represented in the V&Ouml;NIX. Raiffeisen Bank International demonstrates its commitment to sustainability throughout its stakeholder and product policies. In addition, the company-related geopolitical risks have decreased," says Reinhard Friesenbichler, Managing Director at rfu research, explaining the updated sustainability rating.</p>

<title>Welcoming Remarks, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Ale&scaron;, and thank you to the Czech National Bank (CNB) for hosting this year's conference. The CNB also supported this conference in 2017. It is wonderful to have such a great relationship between the&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Central Banking</em>&nbsp;(IJCB) and one of our sponsoring institutions.</p>
<p>I would like to take a few minutes as the outgoing managing editor of the IJCB to emphasize the importance of this journal and the research it supports.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250623a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Central banks play an important role promoting the growth and effective functioning of their economies, and many of the decisions they make are influenced by careful and cutting-edge research. In fact, I recently gave a speech that discussed the importance of economic research in monetary policy decisions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250623a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The IJCB, through this conference and its volumes, provides an outlet to share and disseminate research that adds to public knowledge and understanding and informs the operational and policy decisions of central bankers.</p>
<p>The value of central bank&ndash;focused research has long been known. In the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of the IJCB to focus on the theory and practice of central banking. The journal has attracted distinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve; my immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven, from the European Central Bank; and the current managing editor, Antoine Martin, from the Swiss National Bank, who, unfortunately, could not be here today. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Czech National Bank and also the host of last year's conference, the Central Bank of Italy. Among the ways that central banks serve the public interest is as an ongoing source of economic research, and the strong commitment to the IJCB here in Prague and other capitals advances our collective interest in strong economies and financial stability.</p>
<p>Turning to this year's conference, we chose the theme based on events that have been very much on the minds of central bankers: "Assessing the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic." The past several years have seen significant monetary policy actions across the globe in response to COVID‐19&ndash;induced recessions, inflation higher than in several decades, unprecedented supply chain disruptions, and, in some countries, very tight labor markets. Early on, policymakers' responses appeared quite in sync, but with differing speeds of recovery and varying challenges faced by different types of economies, that changed over time. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and energy price shocks have introduced new complexities. So we thought this conference could be a good place to come together and hear about the lessons we have learned from these common and different experiences.</p>
<p>Today and tomorrow we will be discussing the yield curve, policy rules, and monetary policy transmission. We also will look into banking issues such as loan issuance and financial stability. And we are lucky to have the Fed's Vice Chair for Supervision Miki Bowman here to give a keynote speech. As we go through these sessions, I hope we will all ask ourselves how this work can help policymakers do their jobs better. Through our conversation, I would ask you to share knowledge about each of these topics as they are pertinent around the world.</p>
<p>But before we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous discussion, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the CNB, Simona Malovan&aacute; and Martin Hodula helped organize this conference. Year round, the IJCB co-editors devote many hours of their time to review papers to keep the journal at its high-quality and high-impact status. These individuals are Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga (who is here with us today), Refet G&uuml;rkaynak, &Ograve;scar Jord&agrave;, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, Steven Ongena, and Enrico Sete. Finally, for the past three years, the day-to-day smooth running of the journal couldn't have been accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of Governors. A special thank you goes to my team: Kommaly Dias, Jane Ihrig, and Elie Singer, who worked to oversee the process.</p>
<p>And with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe Martin has a few words to get us started.</p>

<title>Regulatory Priorities In Financial Advice - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Professional Planner Licensee Summit In The Blue Mountains On 23 June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the greatest risks to investors that ASIC is seeing is high-pressure sales practices that lure Australians into investments that are not in their financial interests. Licensees have a role in preventing misconduct and, where concerning conduct is detected, they must report it to ASIC.</li>
<li>Licensees must ensure relevant providers are properly qualified to provide financial advice from the start of 2026.</li>
<li>ASIC is reviewing how well investment managers and financial advisers are managing the potential risks of offshore outsourcing, reminding licenses that their regulatory obligations remain regardless of whether functions are conducted locally or overseas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>I'd like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Dharug and Gundungurra people and pay my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>Thank you, Chris, Aleks, and the Conexus team, for inviting me to speak today about ASIC&rsquo;s priorities in financial advice.</p>
<p>As a regulator, we are conscious that the laws governing the provision of financial advice are complex. That is the way in which they have evolved through progressive amendments in response to risks that have emerged over time.</p>
<p>But despite this complexity, there are some simple principles that sit at the heart of the consumer protection framework for financial advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>When somebody seeks the expert assistance of a financial adviser, that person should be appropriately qualified.</li>
<li>They should provide advice that is in the best interests of their client; and</li>
<li>They should have appropriate processes and resources for managing risks, including risks in relation to data protection.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Australia on the cusp of the largest ever transfer of intergenerational wealth and increasing numbers of Australians nearing the end of their working lives, more and more people are likely to seek financial advice.</p>
<p>When they do, it&rsquo;s important that advice helps to secure their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>That brings with it great responsibility, both on the part of ASIC in ensuring we properly administer and enforce the law and on the part of licensees in ensuring that the financial advisers you authorise work in a way that is consistent with your obligations to deliver efficient, honest and fair financial services.</p>
<p>Two of ASIC&rsquo;s strategic priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To improve consumer outcomes; and</li>
<li>To support better retirement outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these speak directly to your role in the system, and together they provide a backdrop to my comments this morning.</p>
<p>These comments will focus on some of the key risks to positive consumer and retirement outcomes that we are seeing in our work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also include a brief update on our current work in relation to outsourcing.</p>
<h2>High-pressure sales tactics</h2>
<p>I will start with one of the greatest risks to investors that ASIC is seeing &ndash; the use of high-pressure sales tactics to lure Australians into decisions that don&rsquo;t reflect their best interests.</p>
<p>Not only do these practices erode the retirement savings of thousands of Australians, they risk threatening the reputation of the industry.</p>
<p>While only a small proportion of providers may be engaging in this type of misconduct, the risks to consumers are significant.</p>
<p>While there are a range of models that raise serious concerns for ASIC, they often involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers being lured by clickbait ads on social media or websites that encourage them to &ldquo;find their lost super&rdquo; or participate in a &rdquo;super health check&rdquo; for free;</li>
<li>Consumers being asked to hand over their contact information as the first step towards receiving the purported assistance;</li>
<li>Telemarketers then using this information to target those consumers with phone calls, in which they convince the consumer that their current super fund is a poor performer &ndash; regardless of whether or not this is accurate;</li>
<li>Financial advice being provided &ndash; perhaps by the telemarketer, perhaps by a financial adviser they introduce during a phone call &ndash; which recommends that the consumer switch their super into a high-risk investment, often involving property development.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exposes consumers to the risk of significant losses &ndash; not only from the nature of the underlying investments but also from the high fees that are deducted from their super balances, directly or indirectly, by a range of entities along the way.</p>
<p>Addressing this pattern of misconduct is a significant priority for ASIC, as reflected in our 2025 enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>In the past year, we have taken a range of court actions to preserve assets for the benefit of investors where we have suspected misconduct.</p>
<p>We have a range of significant investigations underway in this area, so you should expect to see us take further action, using a broad range of the enforcement tools available to us.</p>
<p>While our work focuses on disrupting and addressing misconduct, we also see it as important to warn investors.</p>
<p>Building on our public warnings through 2024, this week we are kicking off a social media campaign to drive awareness of the issue and direct people to our Moneysmart website for information on how to protect their interests.</p>
<p>I am raising these practices with you here today because it is in all of our interests to stop them.</p>
<p>Licensees have a role in preventing misconduct.</p>
<p>It's your responsibility to ensure advisers are acting in the best interests of clients, and to have adequate monitoring and supervision arrangements to detect concerning conduct.</p>
<p>We are also conscious that the advisers you authorise are in a position to recognise where somebody who comes to them has been a victim of poor advice.</p>
<p>Where you detect concerning conduct, you must report it to ASIC. That includes misconduct involving other licensees.</p>
<p>I hope that we can rely upon you to assist us to drive out these practices which &ndash; as I have noted &ndash; present threats not only to consumers, but also to trust in the financial advice industry.</p>
<h2>Looming deadline to meet qualifications standard</h2>
<p>I started my remarks with a reflection on the importance of people who provide financial advice being appropriately qualified.</p>
<p>The deadline to meet the qualifications standard looms, and it remains unclear how many advisers will be properly qualified to provide personal financial advice on 1 January 2026.</p>
<p>I believe you will be hearing more about this in a panel session this afternoon.</p>
<p>According to our latest spot check<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/regulatory-priorities-in-financial-advice/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, of the 15,610 relevant providers listed in the Financial Advisers Register, 6,426 hold an approved degree or qualification.</p>
<p>That leaves 4,604 who have yet to meet the qualifications standard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that some of these relevant providers may be eligible for the experienced provider pathway, but their AFS licensees are yet to advise us of that.</p>
<p>It is crucial for ASIC to be provided with accurate information in the lead up to the 1 January deadline, and it&rsquo;s concerning that we have identified a number of errors and inconsistencies in the data that is on the register.</p>
<p>Some relevant providers have declared they are relying on the experienced provider pathway when they do not appear eligible.</p>
<p>Others have claimed qualifications when the course has not yet been completed or is not an approved course of study.</p>
<p>As AFS licensees, you need to ensure each relevant provider who intends to provide personal financial advice from 1 January has the appropriate qualifications or is eligible for the experienced provider pathway and notify ASIC.</p>
<p>You should also review the information currently on the Financial Advisers Register about how your relevant providers meet the qualifications standard and ensure it is recorded correctly.</p>
<p>To assist you, ASIC has provided a one-off&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/professional-standards/providing-tax-financial-advice-services/#dataset" title="Providing tax (financial) advice services">temporary dataset</a>&nbsp;that includes information about relevant providers&rsquo; capacity to provide tax and financial advice services and their qualification and training courses.</p>
<p>You will find that dataset on our website.</p>
<p>We will continue monitoring the information on the Financial Advisers Register in the lead up to January and will consider further regulatory responses if required.</p>
<p>After 1 January, ASIC will undertake a compliance program, relying on records on the Financial Advisers Register to determine if relevant providers remain authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients.</p>
<p>You and your advisers have 192 days, so I advise you to act now.</p>
<h2>Offshoring</h2>
<p>I said earlier I would provide an update on our work on the use of offshore outsourcing, which we understand to be increasing across the sector.</p>
<p>From our work to date, we understand that this shift to overseas outsourcing appears to be primarily driven by cost, with local skills shortages also a potential factor.</p>
<p>The main functions being outsourced appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial planning administration; and</li>
<li>Paraplanning services.</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify our view on these practices, ASIC is agnostic about the use of offshore outsourcing.</p>
<p>We do not provide explicit guidance dictating how, or when it is reasonable to outsource financial advice functions overseas.</p>
<p>Our existing regulatory guidance -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-104-afs-licensing-meeting-the-general-obligations/" title="RG 104 AFS licensing: Meeting the general obligations">Regulatory Guide 104</a>&nbsp;&ndash; clearly sets out a licensee&rsquo;s general obligations.</p>
<p>These obligations remain the licensee&rsquo;s obligations irrespective of whether these functions are conducted onshore or offshore.</p>
<p>Whilst there may be potential benefits for consumers in offshoring, for example lower fees or more efficient services, we are alert to the potential risks, particularly in relation to technology, data protection and privacy.</p>
<p>We are also concerned that consumer trust could be severely undermined if businesses are not transparent about their use of offshore providers or have inadequate processes or resources for managing risks.</p>
<p>We are currently undertaking a review into how investment managers and financial advisers are managing these risks.</p>
<p>This work is at an early stage.</p>
<p>We have not yet formed a view as to how well licensees are managing the risks, or if there is any cause for concern, but we expect to be able to share our thoughts on these issues later in the year.</p>
<h2>Close</h2>
<p>In closing, I would note that I hope we share an objective of ensuring that people who seek financial advice enjoy the benefits it can deliver when provided by an appropriately qualified person, with a focus on their client&rsquo;s best interests.</p>
<p>For ASIC, that means ensuring compliance through our supervisory and surveillance work and addressing misconduct where we see it.</p>
<p>For you as licensees, that means ensuring you continue to fulfil your obligations to provide efficient, honest and fair financial services.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your time this morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to answering your questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the unrest in the Middle East region, concerns have arisen regarding regional stability and global economic trends. Such uncertainty may affect investors&rsquo; decision-making because of the lack of clear information about the current situation, and it may potentially impact the securities trading on Monday, June 23, 2025. In response to that, the Board of Governors (BoG) of The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), at its meeting on Sunday, June 22, 2025, has approved the following temporary measures:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you so much, Brian [Schorr]. It is great to see everyone here today in person. Again, thank you for your work on this committee. Virtual interactions are great, but we lose something when we are virtual all the time.</p>
<p>We have a very interesting set of topics today. It is amazing how quickly time flies. It does not seem that long ago that I was staffing then-Commissioner [Paul] Atkins on a series of three proxy roundtables that the Commission held under Chairman [Chris] Cox back in 2007. In fact, Jill Fish, who is here, was a part of those roundtables. Proxy access was the issue of the day. However, the Financial Crisis in 2008 interrupted some of our work. Although we ultimately adopted a concept release on proxy plumbing in 2010,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;we never returned to some of the concerns identified in the proxy process, such as over-voting, under-voting, and vote confirmation. We have had efforts in this space, and I know some solutions have been proposed, such as end-to-end vote confirmation, but we have never comprehensively revisited this issue.</p>
<p>One of the topics that we did not address in 2007 was the role of asset managers, the funds that they advise, and the investors in those funds. The state of passive ETF index funds is very different now than in 2007, especially their size and growth.</p>
<p>This is one of the most exciting aspects of our markets. Things evolve, and things change. When I was detailed to the Senate Banking Committee a couple years ago, this was a new issue. We saw the rise of large amounts of assets under management through broad-based indexed ETFs. These funds offered diversification and often have very low costs.</p>
<p>Today, index fund asset managers represent a larger percentage of beneficial owners. These vehicles are intended to be passive&mdash;not active. You can think of the term &ldquo;active&rdquo; in a few ways. One, you can actively choose your buy and sell positions; or two, you can actively vote your shares. When I worked on the Senate Banking Committee, we held a hearing on this topic. A lot of ideas have emerged and evolved. As a regulator, we must tackle these changes. For example: Do we have the right safeguards in place? Are we looking at the rise of influence through shareholder voting? What is the impact of voting power being increasingly held in these passive collective vehicles?</p>
<p>An example of these emerging trends is majority voting for directors and say-on-pay for executive compensation. After Staff Legal Bulletin 14L,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;we saw the floodgates open on these types of shareholder proposals. As such, it is timely to request feedback on this topic from the committee.</p>
<p>With respect to non-GAAP measures, given our action yesterday regarding foreign private issuers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;I would be remiss if I failed to reference International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Although they differ from GAAP, we have concluded that they are a set of high-quality accounting standards. In addition to GAAP and IFRS, non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures are also presented by companies. We must consider how management, boards, and investors consider those measures. I look forward to your discussion on this topic.</p>
<p>I also look forward to your discussion on mandatory arbitration. Arbitration has very deep roots in federal law. There are pros and cons to each type of legal forum. For example, some broker-dealer claims may be appropriate for arbitration because it is a less expensive forum. However, there are other drawbacks to arbitration, and I look forward to this Committee&rsquo;s thoughtful discussion.</p>
<p>I also note that the Office of Investor Research recently published analysis under the Thoughtful Households Relating InVesting Experiences (THRIVE), a nationally representative survey panel.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;This survey includes noteworthy observations on investor behavior.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Financial regulators often expend significant resources evaluating the practices of major market participants. However, economic data on the preferences and practices of retail investors should also be an important component of our regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>For example, the survey includes information on important topics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The types of investments the U.S. population holds;</li>
<li>The proportion of the U.S. population that purchased various asset types, including crypto;</li>
<li>Why individuals made certain investment decisions; and</li>
<li>An evaluation of the financial well-being of investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn6">[6]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One notable observation is that more investors than non-investors report high financial well-being and more non-investors than investors report low financial well-being.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This result should come as no surprise. Participation in capital markets yields economic benefits and the data reinforces the view that investing in capital markets tends to improve individual financial outcomes.</p>
<p>An additional survey question is also relevant to our path moving forward. The THRIVE Survey asks: &ldquo;Why did people purchase a financial investment.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;This question is relevant to a critical evaluation of SEC policies during the past four years. When asked the reasons for buying an investment, purchasers identified &ldquo;future growth for the investment [being] strong&rdquo; as the number one reason for buying an investment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Other considerations were seeing the investment as a &ldquo;good opportunity,&rdquo; &ldquo;wanting to invest in something new,&rdquo; and &ldquo;[thinking] the investment was undervalued.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-iac-060525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_edn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The data indicates that fundamental economic concerns primarily drive individual investor behavior. We can leverage these conclusions in future policymaking efforts. We should be mindful of these economic considerations when pursuing social or political disclosure rules that are not rooted in financial materiality. Investors are looking at ways to improve their economic circumstances and, as such, our tripartite mission should guide our policymaking path.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Committee members and panelists for your time in preparing for this meeting. I would also like to thank our Investor Advocate, Cristina Martin Firvida, and her staff for their hard work in organizing today&rsquo;s meeting and for their research on these important issues.</p>

<title>CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson’s Keynote Remarks At The CCP AGM 2025 - Addressing Cyber-Risks, Managing Critical Third-Party Relationships, And Reinforcing CCP Resilience</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-commissioner-kristin-n-johnsons-keynote-remarks-at-the-ccp-agm-2025-add-2025620/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-commissioner-kristin-n-johnsons-keynote-remarks-at-the-ccp-agm-2025-add-2025620/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>It is a pleasure to join CCP Global for your Annual General Meeting. Joining you today marks the third time that I have had the opportunity to address this important group at the center of the global derivatives markets. Addressing this body in Madrid, Spain in June of 2022 marked one of the earliest keynote addresses that I delivered during my time in service as a Commissioner only months after I joined the Commission.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During my speech in Madrid, I reflected on then-recent market stress resulting from geopolitical events and a global pandemic. In February and March of 2020, our markets faced concerning shocks from the rise of a global pandemic</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2"><span>[2]</span></a><span>&nbsp;and regulatory responses to contain it.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3"><span>[3]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Markets witnessed unprecedented volatility coupled with extreme volumes of trading and at times tight liquidity, placing extraordinary pressure on market infrastructures. Responding to these events, central counterparties CCPs carefully assessed initial and variation margin requirements and ultimately increased initial margin requirements (particularly for equity products) as an integral part of their market risk mitigating solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>Facing these challenges, CCPs navigated the risks presented, deploying the carefully developed tools at hand with deep and continuous engagement with global regulators. As a result of effective reforms adopted almost a decade before the pressures of recent geopolitical events and a global pandemic at the start of this decade, our financial system demonstrated remarkable resilience.&nbsp; As noted by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) &ndash; &ldquo;Banks and FMIs, particularly CCPs, held up well and were largely able to absorb rather than amplify the shock.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4"><span>[4]</span></a></p>
<p><span>In many ways, market conditions during these events stress tested CCP resilience reforms implemented pursuant to the 2009 G20 Pittsburg Summit and the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI) codified under local laws such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and European Market Infrastructure Regulation.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Turning back to the present, it is fitting that we gather here today in a building that has served as a gathering place for government and industry for hundreds of years. My understanding is that the building began as a convent in 1411, but later, in the 17<span>th</span>&nbsp;Century became the meeting place for the administrative board for the Admiralty of Amsterdam. And, in the mid-1600s, became known as a City Hall and served as the seat of Amsterdam&rsquo;s government.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the spirit of reflecting on the significant contributions of the CCP Global community and the issues that you will discuss and explore during your general meeting, I hope to highlight the work of the advisory committees of the CFTC. Over the last few years, your members have supported and served on a number of the CFTC advisory committees. Having a full complement of five Commissioners for the last three and a half-years means that we put lots of you to work. As the current remaining Commissioners, Acting Chair Pham and I are continuing our commitment to advance important multi-stakeholder dialogues through our role as advisory committee sponsors. I am hopeful that we may even find a path to collaborate with joint sessions hosted by the two advisory committees that we sponsor.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today, please allow me to focus my remarks on the importance of our Commission&rsquo;s advisory committees and highlight some of the suggestions put forth by the Market Risk Advisory Committee (MRAC) following deep engagement on these issues, especially those focused on operational resiliency and&nbsp;derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) system safeguards, and DCO wind down and recovery plans.</span></p>
<p><span>I know that many of you are familiar with the MRAC and other CFTC advisory committees from your service and support as members of their Committees and Subcommittees. The MRAC was established on May 6, 2014 in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) after the Commission determined that MRAC was necessary and in the public&rsquo;s interest.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6"><span>[6]</span></a><span>&nbsp;MRAC&rsquo;s purpose is to support the Commission in &ldquo;promoting [] integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation, as well as the monitoring and management of systemic risk.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7"><span>[7]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Since MRAC&rsquo;s inception, each sponsoring Commissioner has recognized the vital role this advisory committee plays in the development of Commission rules and regulations and utilized MRAC to put forth important reports and recommendations.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8"><span>[8]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The MRAC has a diverse membership with deep experience across all corners of the derivatives space, including representatives of clearinghouses, exchanges, intermediaries, market makers, end-users, academia, public interest advocates, and regulators. Diversity of membership in our advisory committees is critically important to their success and will be vital as we address jurisdiction over emerging markets and novel asset classes as well as the continuous evolution of complex liquidity and market risk issues. Without perspectives from every side of the integral issues that these committees address, we run the risk of limiting our supervision and oversight and missing out on the opportunity to effectively address emerging risks to market stability and integrity.</span></p>
<p><span>The benefits of multi-stakeholder gatherings to address emerging market risks cannot be overstated. Sharing a wide variety of perspectives across our markets to engage in deep, thoughtful, and actionable solutions enables regulators and market participants to be prepared to navigate risks with minimal disruptions and maximum resiliency for strong and vibrant derivatives markets in the U.S. and across the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This, in essence, is why I believe you all meet here on an annual basis as well &ndash; because you recognize the value of deliberative engagement. Allow me to share briefly on two issues that are top of mind for me and that the MRAC has made significant progress addressing&ndash; operational resilience of our derivatives markets and orderly wind down and recovery for DCOs.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Navigating the Cyber Landscape for CCPs</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Cybersecurity risks are growing in our markets and must be proactively managed and addressed. In its 2024 Systemic Risk Barometer Survey, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) noted that cyber risk was a top five systemic risk to the global economy.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9"><span>[9]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Similarly, in May 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that in the past 20 years, the financial sector has suffered over 20,000 cyber-attacks resulting in $12 billion in losses, and noted that there is a growing inequality between cyber resilient organizations and those that lack the resilience to withstand and prevent attacks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10"><span>[10]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Recent events demonstrate the chaos that cybersecurity events can cause for our markets, resulting in billions in losses.</span></p>
<p><span>As many of you are aware, in January of 2023, ION Cleared Derivatives (ION) experienced a significant cyberattack. ION provides important back-office services for many global futures commission merchants (FCMs) and other market participants. ION&rsquo;s effective operations and successful provision of these critical services enable many market participants to clear and settle a significant volume of global transactions on a daily basis. The cyberattack on ION triggered a series of disruptions across markets. Those who rely on ION to perform critical functions were taken offline and many had to rely on manual trade processing. The outage similarly delayed the Commission&rsquo;s ability to deliver timely the Commitments to Traders reports.</span></p>
<p><span>Two years later, in a very different corner of markets, on February 21, 2025, Bybit, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, lost nearly $1.5 billion in losses in mostly Ether from a hacking incident.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11"><span>[11]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The Bybit hack represented one of the single largest losses by any cryptocurrency exchange since the first Bitcoin was mined.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The hackers identified a vulnerability in Bybit&rsquo;s transaction approval process hosted through smart contract logic in off chain infrastructure. What appeared to be a routine transfer from Bybit&rsquo;s Ethereum cold wallet ended up being a rerouting of the transaction to the hacker&rsquo;s wallets. What kinds of vulnerabilities have enabled hackers to capture hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency? Commonly deployed tactics include phishing, supply chain compromises, and private key thefts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the context of the Bybit hack, reports indicate that the hackers accessed critical Bybit systems through a third party provided critical infrastructure system and used this access point to inject malicious software that detected and modified outgoing transactions in real time.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12"><span>[12]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Hackers appear to have gained access to an off chain Safe user interface provided by a third-party service provider.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13"><span>[13]</span></a></p>
<p><span>To provide guardrails for these types of issues, in December 2023, the Commission unanimously approved a proposed rule that would create an operational resilience framework for FCMs, swap dealers (SDs) and major swap participants (MSPs) to &ldquo;identify, monitor, manage, and assess risks relating to information and technology security, third-party relationships, and emergencies or other significant disruptions to normal business operations&rdquo;.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14"><span>[14]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The proposed rule included three components: (1) an information and technology security program; (2) a third-party relationship program; and (3) a business continuity and disaster recovery plan. Each of these components was designed to deliver frameworks to establish protections to FCMs, SDs, and MSPs and, in an event like the ION Derivatives cyberattack, a plan to continue business as normal while post-mortem checks are completed.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to highlight one of the risks that the proposed ORF seeks to address &ndash; concentration risks associated with critical third-party service providers.&nbsp;As early back as 2019, the FSB released a report on third-party dependencies in cloud services and considerations on financial stability implications, including implications of market concentration on competition.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15"><span>[15]</span></a><span>&nbsp;These risks can be heightened for smaller or medium sized firms, who may lack both the resources to develop technology in house as well as the bargaining power to negotiate with limited service providers in many cases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Evidence, as well as our experience in working towards the operational resilience framework, indicates that this may be more pronounced in the markets we regulate where there may be even more limited vendors that can provide the sophisticated technologies often used in the derivatives industry. This is not only a potential issue for compliance with regulations and risk management, but also a business risk for market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>The Central Counterparty (CCP) Risk &amp; Governance Subcommittee of MRAC recognized the need for a rule like ORF to create a regulatory framework for cybersecurity preparedness and business continuity for cyberattacks and built out a proposal to expand the scope to include DCOs and bolster system safeguards for critical third-party service providers.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16"><span>[16]</span></a></p>
<p><em><span>MRAC&rsquo;s Recommendation on DCO System Safeguards for Critical Third-Party Service Providers</span></em></p>
<p><span>The DCO System Safeguards recommendations are an example of MRAC&rsquo;s proactive response to a potential risk identified. The recommendations also highlight the value of the CFTC advisory committees and the potential for diverse stakeholders who may have divergent perspectives to work together to make real progress towards making our markets more resilient.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A technology and operations workstream of the CCP Risk &amp; Governance Subcommittee began evaluating issues related to cybersecurity and third-party risk management in early 2023. In March of that year, MRAC held a &ldquo;first-of-its-kind&rdquo; public meeting to discuss the cybersecurity event at ION Cleared Derivatives that led to a ripple effect across our markets. This was the first chance for experts across our industry to come together following the ION cyberattack to evaluate the event and begin to map out next steps to ensure cyber preparedness among market participants, service providers, and other sources that have the potential to impact our markets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the meeting, Futures Industry Association (FIA) President and CEO Walt Lukken announced the creation of a new Cyber Risk Taskforce, the National Futures Association (NFA) President and CEO Tom Sexton discussed NFA&rsquo;s role in standard setting to mitigate cyberthreats, and we heard from other experts including those from the White House&rsquo;s Office of the National Cyber Director, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and of course, the CFTC, on strategies to enhance the security and resilience of financial markets in the face of new and evolving cyber threats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Later the same year, the FIA Cyber Risk Taskforce issued an After Action Report outlining the challenges facing our markets.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17"><span>[17]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Key findings in the report include a lack of communication amongst market participants in the wake of a cyber incident and the need to connect our market with the broader financial sector to learn from and share the best operational resilience strategies for cyber events. The After Action Report made six recommendations based on their findings: (1) the creation of an &ldquo;Industry Resilience Committee&rdquo; to help develop information channels with respect to operational and cyber resilience; (2) connecting our industry with sector-wide specialist groups who focus on operational resilience across our markets; (3) a self-reflective review of our market participant&rsquo;s policies and procedures for cyber incidents; (4) the establishment of procedures for sharing critical data and information during cyber incidents; (5) identification of ways to assess risk to create more robust operational resilience frameworks; and (6) participation in regularly held cyber preparedness exercises.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18"><span>[18]</span></a></p>
<p><span>The CCP Risk &amp; Governance Committee recognized that there may have been some important gaps in operational resilience and took up the mantle to continue to examine areas not fully addressed by the Commission. The Subcommittee&rsquo;s recommendations highlight the importance of cyber resilience in DCOs and the need for a more robust regulatory framework. These recommendations, which the MRAC voted to advance to the Commission, would improve upon the existing framework and require that DCOs establish, implement, and maintain a third-party relationship management program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The CCP Risk &amp; Governance Committee&rsquo;s report focuses on CFTC Rule 39.18, which establishes system safeguard standards for DCOs and addresses outsourcing but does not expressly discuss third-party relationships. The CCP Risk and Governance recommendations build upon the framework of Rule 39.18 by adding a third-party risk management program to (b)(2). The proposal suggests that a robust third party relationship management program that identifies, assesses, mitigates, and monitors the full risks that are associated with using third party arrangements for critical services should include robust risk management frameworks like policies and procedures that cover the lifecycle of the relationship, personnel assigned to onboarding and diligence of the third party relationships, risk-based monitoring, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The recommendations build upon the philosophy of the DCO Core Principles, lessons learned and best practices from voices across the industry, and international standard setting bodies. As noted in the report,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These principles are intended to reflect lessons learned from industry efforts and best practices in derivatives, the guidance notes in Form DCO, the NFA interpretive guidance, lessons learned from the wider context of third-party relationship management, as well as the principles enunciated in the PFMIs. Incorporating these principles in Commission regulations would enable the Commission to update its regulatory framework with respect to critical third party service providers and to bring its regulations in line with internationally accepted standards, while maintaining a principles based approach to regulation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19"><span>[19]</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Operational resilience, and especially third-party risk management, is a key issue for me, which I continue to track closely and to discuss frequently with my colleagues at the CFTC and at other agencies, as well as with market participants that we regulate, and at events like these. I frequently request that we take these issues seriously and continue to consider actionable steps to address them. As I&rsquo;ve noted previously, &ldquo;effectively combatting cyber threats will require a coordinated effort among regulators and industry,&rdquo; and I am committed to continuing to foster conversations about how we can work together to make our markets safer and more resilient.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20"><span>[20]</span></a></p>
<p><span>I expect that MRAC will continue to consider issues related to cyber resilience and third-party risk management, including as the risks continue to evolve and AI-enhanced cybersecurity creates new or heightened risks.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>DCO Recovery and Wind Down: Parallelism with International Standards</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, the CCP Risk and Governance Subcommittee has outlined supplemental reforms that complement Commission staff work that aims to ensure recovery and orderly wind-down of DCOs as part of the post-crisis reforms and important robust preventative resilience framework. Since reforms adopted in the U.S. under the Dodd-Frank Act, international standard-setting bodies have adopted principles, guidance, and standards to support and inform national policymakers on CCP regulation.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21"><span>[21]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO and together with CPMI, CPMI-IOSCO) and the FSB have published numerous reports on these issues on resilience, recovery, and resolution.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22"><span>[22]</span></a><span>&nbsp;In 2012, CPMI-IOSCO published a report setting forth 24 principles that financial market infrastructures, like CCPs, should apply, with the goal of enhancing safety and efficiency.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23"><span>[23]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The principles, called the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (or PFMI), set forth four foundational pillars for managing financial risk associated with CCPs: governance arrangements of CCPs, comprehensive risk management frameworks, financial resources allocated to loss absorption, and stress testing for both credit and liquidity exposures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FSB issued guidelines</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24"><span>[24]</span></a><span>&nbsp;as well and worked together with CPMI-IOSCO to assess CCP financial resources in connection with recovery and resolution.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25"><span>[25]</span></a><span>&nbsp;In the following years, the Commission took up a similar path, issuing a proposed rule that would apply guidelines and requirements for recovery and orderly wind down plans that are already required for systemically important DCOs (SIDCOs) and Subpart C DCOs to all DCOs.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26"><span>[26]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Proposed DCO Recovery and Wind-Down Rule is robust and important to the Commission and its market participants. Again, MRAC and the CCP Risk &amp; Governance Subcommittee identified four main areas to recommend enhancements: supervisory stress testing of recovery and wind-down plans; conducting recovery scenarios and analysis; inclusion of non-default loss (NDL) in recovery and wind-down plans; and porting of customer positions and collateral during a CCP resolution and clearing member default.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27"><span>[27]</span></a></p>
<p><em><span>The MRAC&rsquo;s Recommendations on DCO Recovery and Orderly Wind-Down Plans; Information for Resolution Planning</span></em></p>
<p><span>At its April 2024 meeting, the MRAC approved another set of recommendations from the CCP Risk &amp; Governance Subcommittee on DCO recovery and orderly wind-down plans and advanced them to the Commission. The recovery and resolution workstream worked on these recommendations in parallel with the Commission developing the Proposed DCO Recovery and Wind-Down Rule and aimed to support the staff in its drafting and the Commission in its consideration of such a rule.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The report included background about the importance of DCOs and CCPs in derivatives markets and actions taken both domestically and internationally to strengthen their resilience, some of which I have shared with you here today. The recommendations in the report demonstrate the depth of expertise available to the Commission through advisory committees and the inclusive nature of all participating viewpoints. For example, the recommendation to implement supervisory stress tests came with a caveat &ndash; while subcommittee members representing end-users, FCMs, and academia believed that stress tests should be required to take place annually, subcommittee members representing DCOs did not believe that the frequency of reverse stress tests should be annual but should be determined by Commission staff.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28"><span>[28]</span></a><span>&nbsp;This is a prime example of why continued participation and robust discussion amongst all viewpoints is a necessity when evaluating the complex issues that face our markets. Although the Commission has yet to complete a final rulemaking on this topic, I hope that the recommendations made by MRAC in this report can provide a roadmap for future engagement.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Work Continues</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I will not have sufficient time today to share all of the details about all of the reports or recommendations that that MRAC has advanced during my time at the Commission, but if you will indulge me, I would like to say a word about some of the other projects that have been completed over the past two years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Market Structure Subcommittee developed a report and recommendations on the Treasury cash-futures basis trade and effective risk management practices, which the MRAC voted to advance to the Commission. The report takes a thoughtful and comprehensive look at the basis trade, including its mechanics and parties involved, the disruptions experienced in March 2020 during broader COVID-19-related market turmoil, and its impacts on the broader economy), and identifies both benefits and risks before the recommending effective risk management practices associated with the cash-futures basis trade.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29"><span>[29]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the most recent MRAC meeting, Josh Frost, then-Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets at the Treasury Department, and members of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee spoke about the importance of Treasury markets and their role in price discovery and liquidity across the financial system, drawing on perspectives from a number of participants in the ecosystem, including both asset managers and hedge funds that participate in the basis trade. This discussion was a good example of the importance of the work of the MRAC on topics that have real implications for our market ecosystem, and the value of bringing together different voices to achieve a deeper, more informed understanding of important issues and how best we can address them.</span></p>
<p><span>To take one more example, earlier last year, the MRAC Market Structure Subcommittee issued a report sharing results from a survey of data on FCMs spanning 2003-2023,</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson21?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30"><span>[30]</span></a><span>&nbsp;which showed some interesting trends in capacity and concentration. At a recent trade association meeting, FIA Boca, I described issues that I believe are critical for the Commission to consider as we begin to explore clearing U.S. Treasuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The data collected in the MRAC Market Structure Subcommittee report outlines industry concentration in the market for FCM services despite the growth of the industry. For example, the survey showed a disproportionate amount of increase in bank-affiliated FCMs and increased concentration of broker-dealer-FCMs that are dully registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of the top ten industry positions in terms of holdings of customer funds were associated with banks or broker-dealers, and they accounted for more than 80% of all customer funds.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We must continue to support our advisory committees and robust multi-stakeholder engagement. Each significantly benefit the stability and integrity of our markets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before closing, I would like to personally thank everyone that has supported the MRAC in any way, through service as an MRAC member, participation on a workstream to advance a set of recommendations to the Commission, by serving as an expert presenter at a meeting, or just tuning into the CFTC YouTube page to watch a meeting &ndash; thank you for dedicating your time. If you have not served on an advisory committee, I encourage you to consider service and the potential to contribute to the important engagement that service offers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The broader CFTC community is part of what makes this agency so special and enables us to punch above our weight. It has been an honor to work with and learn from all of you, and I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish together next.&nbsp;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Starting from June 23, 2025, the process of calculation and collection of additional fee (AF) on the Securities market is adjusted. The calculation and collection of the AF will be made separately for each calendar day, including the days of an additional weekend trading session. This will avoid situations where a trading member receives the AF for multiple days, even if it did not exceed the threshold on each day.A new version of the document "Additional fees and charges stipulated in the Integrated IT Service Agreement" has been published on the MOEX website: <a href="https://fs.moex.com/files/18033">https://fs.moex.com/files/18033</a> (Russian only).</p>

<title>Report From FINRA Board Of Governors Meeting – June 2025 - Board Approves Two Rule Proposals, Appoints New Advisory Committee Members And Approves The 2024 Annual Financial Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-from-finra-board-of-governors-meeting-june-2025-board-approves-two-ru-2025620/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/report-from-finra-board-of-governors-meeting-june-2025-board-approves-two-ru-2025620/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FINRA&rsquo;s Board of Governors met June 4-5. The Board approved two rule proposals, approved the appointments of new Advisory Committee members, met with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Mark Uyeda, and received updates on FINRA&rsquo;s long-term financial planning and FINRA&rsquo;s enterprise risk management and cybersecurity program.</p>
<h3>Rulemaking</h3>
<p>The Board approved the following rule proposals at the June meeting. General information about FINRA&rsquo;s rulemaking process is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulemaking-process" title="FINRA&rsquo;s rulemaking process">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amendments to FINRA Rule&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/4311" title="FINRA Rule 4311 (Carrying Agreements)"><strong>4311</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;(Carrying Agreements</strong>)&mdash;The Board approved issuing a Regulatory Notice to solicit comment on proposed amendments to Rule 4311, which governs requirements when member firms enter into agreements for the carrying of customer accounts. The amendments would provide greater clarity around tri-party arrangements where one introducing firm contracts through another introducing firm to receive carrying and clearing services; clarify the allocation of responsibilities under carrying agreements; address the application of the rule to omnibus carrying arrangements; and streamline requirements relating to the furnishing of reports by carrying firms to introducing firm.</li>
<li><strong>Amendments to FINRA Rule&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2210" title="FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public)"><strong>2210</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;(Communications with the Public)</strong>&mdash;The amendments would better align the regulatory requirements for broker-dealers and investment advisers related to performance projections in written communications to investors. The amendments would create a narrowly tailored exception to the general prohibition on projections and permit the presentation of projected performance and targeted returns when members meet specified conditions, including adopting policies and procedures, having a reasonable basis for the criteria and assumptions made in calculating the projections or targeted returns, and providing specified information. The amendments will be filed with the SEC for approval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Board Actions and Updates</h3>
<p>The Board appointed new members to FINRA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/advisory-committees" title="FINRA&rsquo;s Advisory Committees">Advisory Committees</a>, effective June 5. FINRA has 12 advisory committees that provide feedback on rule proposals, regulatory initiatives and industry issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to welcome the new members of the Advisory Committees. Participation and engagement in the Advisory Committees leads to meaningful feedback on a variety of regulatory matters. The Board values that input as we work to provide strategic guidance for FINRA&rsquo;s vital work of protecting investors and maintaining market integrity,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors/scott-a-curtis" title="FINRA Board Chair - Scott Curtis">FINRA Board Chair Scott Curtis</a>.</p>
<p>The Board continued discussions around FINRA&rsquo;s long-term financial planning and approved FINRA&rsquo;s 2024 Annual Financial Report, which FINRA publishes in accordance with its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf" title="Financial Guiding Principles">Financial Guiding Principles</a>. FINRA&rsquo;s Annual Financial Report will be published later this month.</p>
<p>The Board received several operational updates, including on FINRA&rsquo;s enterprise risk management and cybersecurity program.</p>
<p>The next FINRA Board meeting is scheduled for September. More information about the Board's operations, including membership and responsibilities of its committees, is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance" title="FINRA Governance">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reported on the performance of first-lien mortgages in the federal banking system during the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>OCC Mortgage Metrics Report, First Quarter 2025</em>&nbsp;showed that 97.6 percent of mortgages included in the report were current and performing at the end of the quarter, an increase from 97.4 percent one year earlier.</p>
<p>The percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages &ndash; mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held by bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due &ndash; decreased from the first quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Servicers initiated 10,667 new foreclosures in the first quarter of 2025 showing an increase from the previous quarter and an increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Servicers completed 7,889 modifications during the first quarter of 2025, a 7.6 percent increase from the previous quarter&rsquo;s 7,332 modifications. Of these 7,889 modifications, 7,267, or 92.1 percent, were &ldquo;combination modifications&rdquo; &mdash; modifications that included multiple actions affecting the affordability and sustainability of the loan, such as an interest rate reduction and a term extension.</p>
<p>The first-lien mortgages included in the OCC&rsquo;s quarterly report comprise 20.1 percent of all residential mortgage debt outstanding in the United States or approximately 10.9 million loans totaling $2.7 trillion in principal balances.</p>
<p>This report provides information on mortgage performance through March 31, 2025, and is available on the OCC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/mortgage-metrics-reports/index-mortgage-metrics-reports.html" title="Mortgage Metrics Reports">website</a>.</p>

<title>The EBA Reviews Standardised Terminology In Relation To Payment Accounts And Concludes It Remains Fit-For-Purpose</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-reviews-standardised-terminology-in-relation-to-payment-accounts-and-con-2025620/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a report, in which it reviewed the standardised terms for the most common services related to payment accounts, as mandated by the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD). These&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/consumer-protection/technical-standards-standardised-terminology-and-disclosure-documents-under-pad">standardised terms</a><span>, which the EBA had issued in 2018, aim at making it easier for consumers to make informed choices by being able to compare payment accounts fees and offers, including on a cross-border basis. The review finds that the standardised terms remain fit-for-purpose across the European Union.</span></p>
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The standardised terms are set out in Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) developed by the EBA in line with the requirements in the PAD. The EBA is required to regularly review those standardised terms. The EBA carried out its review in the first half of 2025 using a methodology that involved assessing recent EU payments laws, collecting information from National Competent Authorities (NCAs), consulting with relevant stakeholders such as the EBA Banking Stakeholder Group (BSG), and analysing internal data from recently published EBA reports.</p>
<p>The findings of the review indicate that the current list of standardised terms remains suitable and does not require immediate changes. In the review process, the EBA acknowledged that there would be potential benefit for the standardised terms to be amended to include instant credit transfers, due to their increasing prevalence following the implementation of the Instant Payment Regulation (IPR). However, the EBA is of the opinion that the benefit is outweighed by the costs involved, for NCAs and for the industry as a result of the need to make available amended disclosure documents to all of their customers and NCAs. The EBA, therefore, concluded not to amend the RTS and instead to revisit the findings in four years&rsquo; time or when significant other market or legislative developments occur to ensure the terminology remains relevant and effective.</p>
<h4>Background and legal basis</h4>
<p>Article 3(4) of the Payment Accounts Directive (PAD) mandates the EBA to draft RTS setting out the Union standardised terminology for those services that are common to at least a majority of Member States.&nbsp;Article 3(6) of the PAD requires the EBA to review and, where necessary, update the standardised terminology.</p>
<p>The PAD mandates the EBA to regularly review if the standardised terminology in the RTS remains fit-for-purpose and provides clarity and consistency for consumers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The RTS adopted by the European Commission as a Delegated Regulation are available&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018R0032">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Governor Pyshnyy, when you invited me to speak today, I was in no doubt that I was going to be here in person. The UK and Ukraine share unbreakable bonds, which were recognised in the 100 Year Partnership signed in January. That Partnership cements our long-term friendship and lays the foundations for even greater collaboration in areas like science and technology, defence and energy &ndash; to go alongside the existing co-operation we have as central banks. As our Prime Minister said when he signed the Partnership, we are closer than ever. But more than that, I am quite simply in awe of what Ukraine confronts as a nation, what you face as a central bank, and how you have conducted yourselves during these most difficult of times.</p>
<p>Of course, it is now accepted good practice that we should all prepare for extreme events, and develop contingency plans to respond to a range of possible scenarios. But our contingency events don&rsquo;t begin to compare with what you have to deal with on a daily basis. To illustrate this point, we have learned from what you do when it comes to serious disruptions to payments systems and to everyday banking business.</p>
<p>Even though I have been determined to be here today, I can&rsquo;t claim &ndash; with all humility &ndash; to appreciate properly your experience. We must give you all the help we can, and by doing so give a very clear message that our support is unconditional.</p>
<p>Before I joined the Bank of England forty years ago, I was an economic historian. History does matter &ndash; you know this painfully well. I don&rsquo;t subscribe to any simplistic view that history repeats itself, but I do believe that there are strands running through history. Long history has shaped your nation. The word nation is critical because the central question is do we share your belief in Ukraine&rsquo;s right to determine its own future. The answer must be yes.</p>
<p>It is also critical to a central bank in your position. Why is that? Modern central banking is built on the independence of the institution. This is critical to our ability to fulfil our objectives. But, we must be clear what this independence means, and what it doesn&rsquo;t mean. We are independent from governments under terms set out in legislation. However we are not independent of our people, the people we serve. Our independence is granted by their representatives in parliaments.</p>
<p>And, our independence extends as far, but not further than, the objectives that we are given by Parliament. Central banks are therefore an emanation of the nation state, and through that the people we serve.</p>
<p>We are responsible and accountable for our objectives. Our legitimacy and authority depend on our accountability. This is the essence of modern central banking. There are typically two objectives of modern central banking &ndash; monetary and financial stability. I am going to spend most of the rest of my time setting out how we need to think of them together. But, before I do that, I want to make another important point about our frameworks, which relates to their ability to manage shocks.</p>
<p>These are the real tests of our policy frameworks in respect of monetary and financial stability. It&rsquo;s one thing to develop frameworks in relatively calmer times, but to persist they must be able to stand up and deliver in the face of big adverse shocks.</p>
<p>This has not always been the case in the past. Let me give one example, in the area of monetary policy. The classical Gold Standard emerged to prominence during the nineteenth century. It existed before then, albeit without the same prominence. The nineteenth century was not without economic shocks, but the Gold Standard of the day provided a system in which those shocks could be handled &ndash; not always with ease, but still it survived the tests. However, it could not survive the much larger shocks of the period between the two world wars.</p>
<p>In modern times we have combined floating exchange rates and free cross-border capital movements with independent monetary policy oriented towards the domestic objective of price stability. Central to achieving this objective are two things &ndash; the independence of the central bank, and a so-called nominal anchor, usually an inflation target which seeks to stabilise the real value of money. We regard this, rightly, as the best way to support activity in our economies. Let me borrow from your web pages: &ldquo;We care about the welfare of Ukraine and Ukrainians by ensuring price and financial stability as a guarantee of sustainable economic growth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The real test of these regimes is how well they have stood up to recent shocks. And, do they provide us with a suitable and helpful combination of the rigour of a nominal anchor &ndash; the inflation target &ndash; with some appropriate flexibility in how we respond to shocks without compromising the anchor? I think the answer is an encouraging yes.</p>
<p>We cannot prevent these shocks from happening &ndash; the causes are well outside our control. But we can prevent the inflationary consequences becoming embedded in our economies, and do so without causing consequences which undermine the legitimacy of our framework &ndash; avoiding the problem of the classical Gold Standard in the inter-war period. With the important qualification that the job is not, and is never, done, I think we can argue that a focus on domestic price stability and a nominal anchor has proved its worth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the task is both to respond to the shock itself when it hits, and then to the consequences of the shock, which can be quite different. This is where appropriate flexibility and strong transparency and accountability are critical.</p>
<p>Your experience has been extreme in so many respects, including this one. In the face of full scale war you have had to adapt a combination of interest rate and exchange rate policy instruments, FX restrictions and other tools as necessary. But, you have been very clear in public that after the security risks abate and appropriate macroeconomic conditions are established in place, you will return to conventional inflation targeting.</p>
<p>The message is clear. But more than that, and here the comparison with the Gold Standard is relevant, the commitment to get back to the established regime strikes me as both credible and critical.</p>
<p>To conclude, then, we can now start to assess whether the modern orthodoxy of domestic price stability with a nominal anchor in the form of an inflation target is robust in the sense that it can handle severe economic shocks. This is the critical test. And, I think we can be positive here, always accepting that the job is never done.</p>
<p>Let me move on to my second theme. What are we learning about how our two objectives &ndash; monetary and financial stability - fit together?</p>
<p>One of the most pleasurable parts of my job is travelling around the UK on a regular basis visiting businesses and hearing about their experiences. When I do this, I try also to visit schools, and speak to students and answer their questions. I usually say a few words at the start to summarise and describe what we do. My opening line is that as the central bank &ldquo;we are in the money business&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It sometimes gets a smile. Monetary policy, as I have described, is about the real value of money, about price stability and low and stable inflation. It&rsquo;s about confidence in the future of money, the value of money in real terms. Financial stability is about ensuring the future nominal value of money.</p>
<p>Put simply, it is about confidence that the unit of money in one bank account is the same as the one in another bank account at another bank, and likewise that they will be equal to and freely exchangeable with a unit of central bank money, say a banknote. I call this the singleness of money.</p>
<p>It is to ensure this singleness that we pursue financial stability, and in doing so that we regulate banks. And it is why, in my view, these activities have to be in the responsibility of central banks. Unless we pursue and achieve both our monetary and financial stability objectives, we are not fulfilling our role of ensuring the stability of the money system &ndash; that&rsquo;s what it means to be in the money business.</p>
<p>It also follows in my view that there is not a hierarchy of our two objectives &ndash; one is not more important than the other. Rather, neither can be achieved satisfactorily without the other also being achieved. I can understand how it can seem odd to have to make this point, but to this day I sometimes hear it argued that there is, or ought to be, a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Two important points also need to be made here. The first is that by no means all of the financial system comprises money. Moreover, the share of the non-money system in the total has grown of late. The second point is that there can be evolution in the precise form that money takes. I will consider these two points in turn.</p>
<p>In order to understand the boundaries of money, it helps to define it. I will do this in two, very traditional, ways. The first is the uses of money. There are three: as a unit of account; as a store of value; and as means of exchange. The second definition is about forms of money. We tend to think of two forms of money: money in the accounts of commercial banks &ndash; bank deposits; and money in the accounts of central banks &ndash; banknotes and reserve accounts held by banks. Central bank money is also often referred to as fiat money, in the sense that it has the full backing of the state. This is another reflection of the subtlety of the meaning of central bank independence as I described it earlier. It is to the sum of commercial and central bank money that the notion of singleness applies, and it is thus to this sum that ensuring the nominal value is preserved applies.</p>
<p>This said, when we look at the total financial system at present, by most accounts over half of it is not money, in the sense that it is held outside the banking system. We have adopted the term non-bank financial institutions to describe these institutions, or NBFIs for short. I tend to think of NBFIs as the world of investment. It is not a perfect distinction I admit. But the key difference is that when you invest in a non-bank, you do so on the basis that the nominal value of your investment is not assured. This is important, because to grow the economy requires risk taking via investment, quite a bit of which would not be compatible with the assurance of the nominal value of money.</p>
<p>Moreover, a key lesson of the global financial crisis was that banks needed to maintain higher standards of capital and liquidity in order to provide that assurance of nominal value. And it follows from that change to the standards of protection of money in banks, that the non-bank world expanded as some investment assets moved out of banks.</p>
<p>But there are at least three areas of potential difficulty in this arrangement on which we must be focused. The first concerns ambiguity. We have to be on the alert for the development of financial structures which are vague as to whether they are, or are not, inside the money system. In the run-up to the financial crisis, banks created so-called off-balance sheet vehicles which were assumed to be outside the money system.</p>
<p>But when problems hit, they found that investors in these vehicles assumed they were inside the bank, and the bank&rsquo;s own reputation came to depend on them being so. Problems ensued.</p>
<p>The second area of difficulty concerns risks which can originate outside the banking system but then spread into it. Banks and non-banks are often closely interconnected &ndash; for instance in financial markets. As the non-bank system grows, so do these connections. This is why we are spending so much more time now assessing the risks that can arise from non-banks. It is one thing to distinguish banks and non-banks in functional terms, but that does not mean they are insulated from each other, far from it.</p>
<p>The third area of difficulty concerns a challenge that does arise nowadays, namely whether we have over-protected the banking system via excessive regulation, and in so doing pushed more risk into non-banks which would be more safely housed in banks. Put another way, have we increased overall financial stability risk by raising the bar too high in banks? It&rsquo;s a fair enough question, but intrinsically hard to answer.</p>
<p>I think the best way to approach this question remains to ask what it takes to preserve the singleness of money, because this is the heart of our concern with financial stability. And the answer is that we have rightly raised regulatory standards for banks in the light of a financial crisis, the effects of which continue to be felt almost 15 years on.</p>
<p>I will end with a few thoughts on the other issue I raised earlier, evolution in the forms of money, and what this implies. Mention of this point is often followed either by the word crypto or by the term digital money. I am not going to do justice to what is a very big issue, but a few points are salient here.</p>
<p>First, a few words on crypto. I see crypto as taking two forms: unbacked assets of the Bitcoin sort, and backed assets of the Stablecoin sort. I think it helps to see these two as distinct. Why? The Bitcoin sort does not have the characteristics of money &ndash; critically, it does not purport to maintain nominal value, and thus fails the test of the singleness of money. Instead, it is an investment asset, with no real asset backing, and volatile in price.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risky investment class and should be seen as such. The buyer should beware &ndash; so-called caveat emptor applies. Stablecoins are different because they purport to have the characteristics of money and to be usable as such. There is nothing wrong with this, but to pass the test they must provide assurance of nominal value and pass the test of singleness of money. That is perfectly possible to achieve, though I would observe that many of the current versions do not quite achieve that test, not yet at least. In my view we should focus our attention on standards for stablecoins which ensure they do pass the test.</p>
<p>My second thought in the area of the evolution of forms of money concerns so-called digital currency.</p>
<p>What do we mean by this term? After all, money &ndash; in the form of central bank reserves &ndash; has been digital in form for many years. I think we mean, how do we get the benefits of new digital technologies in the area of payments &ndash; where money is a medium of exchange? For instance, how do we get the benefits of smart contracts in payments, and the benefits of using digital technology to fight fraud? I start with the presumption that there should be benefit here &ndash; it seems like a failure of imagination if we think otherwise. That said, I remain to be convinced that we need to create new forms of money &ndash; such as Central Bank Retail Digital Currency &ndash; to achieve this.</p>
<p>By the way, the word retail is important here &ndash; we are well on the way to having wholesale central bank digital money, but that is just a natural step on from the wholesale electronic money that we have had for thirty years in our case.</p>
<p>This brings me to my third and final thought in this area. Most payments these days are made in commercial bank money. That&rsquo;s natural &ndash; it&rsquo;s the form that all our bank accounts take, and we want to make payments straight from our accounts. Logically, then, if there are real benefits to digital technology in payments, we should want to see them in commercial bank money. The buzzword here is tokenised deposits &ndash; a bit of a mouthful, but really it is the application of digital technology to the form of money that we have today. The challenge is to apply this to both domestic and cross-border and cross-border currency payments. To be clear, I am not against stablecoins, but they do have to meet the test of singleness of money. I am not against Central Bank Retail Digital Currency, but I question why it is needed if innovation proceeds as I think it should.</p>
<p>That said, you may detect from what I have said that I do think commercial banks need to step up to the challenge of digital money provision.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To conclude, we are living in a world of much larger economic shocks which have their origins outside economic causes. But, what the rest of us are experiencing is minor compared to the tragedy caused by the illegal invasion of your country. Our independence as central banks is grounded in the nation state and the people we serve. This makes it of critical importance that you can exercise your right to determine your future as a nation. I have set out what I regard as important issues for central banks and their twin objectives of monetary and financial stability.</p>
<p>I wish you every success in addressing these issues as a free, strong and independent Ukraine. And I look forward to a future of strong friendship and collaboration between the NBU and Bank of England, as well as between Ukraine and the UK. Never have we been closer, and we must remain that way.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Karen Jude and Rhys Phillips for their help in the preparation of these remarks. I am grateful to the staff of the British Embassy Kyiv and FCDO colleagues for their help in making my visit possible.</p>

<title>Bank Of England - Asset Purchase Facility: Gilt Sales – Market Notice 20 June 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-20-june-20-2025620/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-20-june-20-2025620/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>This Market Notice sets out the schedule for sales in Q3 2025 of gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) for monetary policy purposes.</span></p>
<p>At its September 2024 meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts held in the APF by &pound;100 billion over the period from October 2024 to September 2025, to a total of &pound;558 billion.</p>
<p>The Bank set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2022/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-september-2022">consolidated APF gilt sales Market Notice</a>&nbsp;published on 1 September 2022 that it would publish a quarterly schedule for the sales of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes. The details and schedule for the Q3 2025 sales of such gilts are set out in this Market Notice, which covers the period from 7 July 2025 to the week commencing 28 July 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/december/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-15-december-2023">15 December 2023 Market Notice</a>, the Bank will set a schedule of auctions in order to continue to reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors, measured in initial proceeds terms. The maturity sectors are defined as gilts with a residual maturity of between: 3-7 years (short), 7-20 years (medium) and over 20 years (long).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2024/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-19-september-2024">19 September 2024 Market Notice</a>, the Bank set out that it expected to hold one auction in each of the maturity sectors in each of the first three quarters, with the final quarter (Q3 2025) likely to consist of only short and medium maturity sector auctions. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2025/april/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-10-april-2025">10 April 2025 Market Notice</a>, the Bank noted that it intended to reschedule a long maturity auction from Q2 2025, to the following quarter. Accordingly, in Q3 2025 the Bank will sell short maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;750 million, medium maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;750 million, and long maturity sector bonds across one auction of &pound;600 million. Further details are outlined in the table below.</p>
<p>Other than as amended in this Market Notice, the detailed operational parameters and participation requirements set out previously will apply to these gilt sales.</p>
<p>The Bank will continue to monitor the impact of its gilt sales programme on market conditions, and reserves the right to amend its schedule, including the gilts to be sold and the size of its auctions, or any other aspect of its approach at its sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank intends to communicate any future sales schedules for 2025 Q4 or beyond following the MPC&rsquo;s annual review of the reduction in the stock of purchased gilts over the next twelve-month period, which is expected to be announced alongside the MPC meeting on 18 September 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) brings its flagship investor education fair InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>to the east coast region with a three-day event in Kuantan to boost investment knowledge and improve scam awareness among investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The June 20-22 event, known as Bersama InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup>@Pahang 2025, gathers government officials, capital market industry players and regulators under one roof as part of the SC&rsquo;s investor outreach initiative.</p>
<p>Chairman of Investment, Industrial Development, Science, Technology and Innovation Committee for the State of Pahang, Dato' Mohamad Nizar bin Dato' Sri Mohamad Najib, officiated the event at the East Coast Mall in Kuantan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 40 exhibitors are taking part in the event, themed &lsquo;Bijak Labur Hidup Makmur&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The SC has also lined up public talks, panel sessions, an anti-scam zone serving as a onestop centre to learn about scams, and more than 100 free one-to-one financial planning sessions under #FinPlan4u<sup>&reg;</sup> where visitors can learn about their financial goals from licensed financial planners.</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi emphasised the importance of reaching out directly to Malaysians in combating investment scams and misinformation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial empowerment starts with education &ndash; and that&rsquo;s what InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> is all about,&rdquo; he said in his welcoming speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want Malaysians to feel confident and equipped to make smart financial choices, especially in today&rsquo;s rapidly evolving investment landscape. This includes being wellprepared for long-term goals such as retirement planning,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As scams become more sophisticated, the best defense is a well-informed public. Through InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup>, we&rsquo;re building a resilient generation of investors who are not only savvy but also scam-aware,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz said the SC has seen a worrying surge in complaints and enquiries, with 3,602 complaints and enquiries received on scams and unlicensed activities in 2024,a 10% increase compared to the year before. As of May, the SC has already received 1,218 complaints and enquiries. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is therefore urged to remain vigilant and cautious when dealing with investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Since 2014, InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> has reached millions of Malaysians nationwide through fairs and community engagements. With investment scams on the rise, especially in the digital space, initiatives like InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> play a vital role in creating vigilant and well-informed investors.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Bersama InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> is being held in Pahang, following successful editions in Johor, Penang, Sarawak and Sabah. &nbsp;</p>

<title>Puro.earth And CUR8 Partner To Accelerate Supplier Access to Offtake Financing And Scale Carbon Removal - New Partnership Enables Puro.earth Suppliers To Link Offtakes To CUR8 Financing Product</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/puroearth-and-cur8-partner-to-accelerate-supplier-access-to-offtake-financing-a-2025620/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/puroearth-and-cur8-partner-to-accelerate-supplier-access-to-offtake-financing-a-2025620/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Puro.earth, the leading standard and registry for engineered carbon removal, has today announced a strategic partnership with CUR8, the Google Ventures-backed carbon removal intelligence platform, giving Puro.earth&rsquo;s suppliers streamlined access to CUR8&rsquo;s offtake financing product.</p>
<p>The partnership addresses a key bottleneck in scaling carbon removal &ndash; access to capital &ndash; by turning future offtake revenue into upfront cash. CUR8&rsquo;s first-of-a-kind offtake financing product will now connect directly with Puro.earth&rsquo;s Offtake Reporting Tool, enabling suppliers already on Puro.earth&rsquo;s platform to apply for offtake financing.</p>
<p>Puro.earth&rsquo;s Offtake Reporting Tool enables projects to report and monitor signed offtake agreements via the MyPuro platform, and benefit from retirement fee waivers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CUR8&rsquo;s offtake financing product provides eligible projects with upfront cash for contracted carbon credit revenues. This solves a key barrier for the sector, with many carbon removal projects too early for traditional project finance, too capital intensive for venture, and unable to rely on hard-to-access corporate prepayments.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, offtakes reported through Puro.earth&rsquo;s tool can check for eligibility for CUR8&rsquo;s offtake financing product, and submit information to CUR8 directly, helping suppliers save time when looking to access capital earlier in the development cycle.</p>
<p><span><i>&ldquo;Scaling carbon removal requires not only scientific integrity but financial innovation, which is why we are working on a number of innovations to help unlock the market,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</span>said&nbsp;<b>Jan-Willem Bode, CEO of Puro.earth.</b>&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;By connecting our suppliers directly to CUR8's financing platform, we're removing friction from the funding process and accelerating the deployment of proven carbon removal technologies.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span><i>&ldquo;The carbon removal sector is entering a scale-up phase &ndash; and access to capital is the key enabler,&rdquo;</i></span><i>&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;<b>Marta Krupinska, CEO and Co-Founder of CUR8</b>.&nbsp;<span><i>&ldquo;Together with Puro.earth, we&rsquo;re accelerating the growth of high-quality carbon removal projects and paving the way for the most impactful climate solutions to be brought forward at scale.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p>Puro.earth&rsquo;s certification framework provides the scientific foundation that enables financing partnerships like this and underpins market trust. Its certification ensures CORCs (CO₂ Removal Certificates) are based on measurable, durable, and verifiable carbon removal. For early-stage suppliers, alignment with an established standard helps signal credibility to buyers and financing partners &ndash; particularly before operations or credit issuance begin.</p>
<p>CUR8 combines financial and scientific expertise to plan, buy and manage high-quality, diversified carbon removal portfolios. As the leading carbon removal intelligence platform, CUR8 offers products and services that accelerate carbon removal development, unlocking finance for projects to scale faster, with lower risk and greater confidence.</p>
<p>Launched in May, CUR8&rsquo;s offtake financing product builds on the company&rsquo;s successful 2024 pilot with British Airways and Standard Chartered, which enabled upfront financing for more than 4,000 tonnes of removals to be delivered by Enhanced Rock Weathering developer, UNDO.</p>
<p>This collaboration combines Puro.earth&rsquo;s trusted certification framework with CUR8&rsquo;s innovative financing solutions to create a more investable, scalable, and high-integrity carbon removal market. Together, both companies are helping real projects grow with the transparency, capital, and credibility needed to meet global climate goals.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></h4>
<p><b>Puro.earth x CUR8 partnership: How It Works</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Suppliers use the Offtake Reporting Tool in MyPuro, Puro.earth&rsquo;s platform for managing future and issued CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs), to disclose signed offtake agreements.</li>
<li>Suppliers can request an assessment of their reported offtake and its eligibility for CUR8&rsquo;s offtake financing product.</li>
<li>CUR8 will review these submissions, determine suitability for financing, and work with suppliers to unlock upfront cash against future CORC deliveries in the form of loans.</li>
<li>Puro.earth will waive the retirement fee on CORCs tied to these reported offtakes. </li>
</ul>

<title>84% Of The World’s Top Steel And Cement Emitters Cite Climate Measures, But Few Take Concrete Action - Clarity AI Analysis Reveals That, Despite Bold Targets, Companies In Two Sectors Responsible For Close To 15% Of Global CO₂ Emissions Show Limited Real-World Progress On Decarbonization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On the occasion of London Climate Action Week,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://clarity.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clarity AI</a>, the leading global sustainability technology company, has released new research on climate progress among the world&rsquo;s most carbon-intensive companies in the steel and cement sectors. Despite representing approximately 15% of global CO₂ emissions and widespread commitments to reduce their environmental impact, most of these companies remain far behind in achieving meaningful decarbonization.</p>
<p>The analysis, which assessed 50 of the highest-emitting companies globally, reveals a growing disconnect between commitments and actual results. While more than&nbsp;<b>70% of companies have set emissions reduction goals</b>,&nbsp;<b>none of the steel companies</b>&nbsp;analyzed are aligned with the IEA&rsquo;s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) pathway, and fewer than&nbsp;<b>40% are on track</b>&nbsp;to meet even their own targets. In the cement sector, emissions have remained flat since 2018, and carbon intensity has improved by just&nbsp;<b>8% since 2019,&nbsp;</b>&mdash;well below the IEA&rsquo;s NZE scenario, which requires annual CO₂ intensity reductions of approximately 4% through 2030.</p>
<p>These findings highlight a widening gap between ambition and execution&mdash;raising critical concerns for investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders seeking to understand which companies are truly prepared for a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p><b>Companies pulling key levers show 9% lower emissions and a 14-year head start</b></p>
<p>To evaluate how companies are turning targets into action, Clarity AI used a proprietary framework that combines emissions data with advanced large language models (LLMs) to assess the credibility of transition plans. This framework evaluates both climate performance and the implementation of key decarbonization levers, including&mdash;among others&mdash;Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) or hydrogen-based reduction in steel, and clinker substitution or carbon capture in cement.</p>
<p><img alt="Clarity_One_20Jun25" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Clarity_One_20Jun25.jpg" title="Clarity_One_20Jun25" /></p>
<p><span>In the&nbsp;</span><b>steel sector</b><span>, scrap metal use and renewable electricity are commonly cited strategies. EAFs are mentioned by 40% of companies, hydrogen-based reduction by 36%, and CCS by just 20%. Despite limited disclosure, early evidence suggests that companies deploying these levers are ahead of their peers. Notably, steel producers using EAFs show carbon intensities that are&nbsp;</span><b>9% lower</b><span>&nbsp;than those who do not, equivalent to a&nbsp;</span><b>14-year head start</b><span>&nbsp;at current decarbonization rates.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="Clarity_Two_20Jun25.jpg" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Clarity_Two_20Jun25.jpg" title="Clarity_Two_20Jun25.jpg" /><br /></span></p>
<p><span>In the&nbsp;</span><b>cement sector</b><span>, the most frequently referenced decarbonization levers are alternative fuels (cited by 72% of companies) and clinker substitution (68%). However,&nbsp;</span><b>only 40% mention Carbon Capture and Storage</b><span>&nbsp;(CCS)&mdash;despite its importance for long-term emissions reduction. Still, early patterns are emerging: companies with lower clinker-to-cement ratios tend to have lower carbon intensities. CCS is still at an early stage, but those beginning to implement it already show faster decarbonization.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="Clarity_Three_20Jun25.jpg" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Clarity_Three_20Jun25(1).jpg" title="Clarity_Three_20Jun25.jpg" /><br /></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;While many companies mention decarbonization levers, most do not quantify their actions. Disclosure of operational timelines, investment figures, or deployment scale is still uncommon. This lack of detail makes it difficult for investors, regulators, and other stakeholders to separate meaningful transition strategies from superficial claims&rdquo;, said Nico Fettes, Climate Research Director at Clarity AI.</p>
<p><b>84% of reports included data on climate levers, while only 74% reported emissions metric</b></p>
<p>The study also finds that data on decarbonization levers is&nbsp;<b>more consistently reported than basic emissions data</b>. Lever-related disclosures appeared in&nbsp;<b>84% of company reports</b>, compared to&nbsp;<b>just 74% for emissions metrics</b>.</p>
<p>This gap suggests increased recognition of the importance of decarbonization strategies, but also exposes a&nbsp;<b>lack of quantitative information</b>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evaluating transition plans is no longer optional&mdash;it&rsquo;s essential. Emissions data alone doesn&rsquo;t tell the full story. What really matters is whether companies are taking concrete steps today to achieve their long-term goals&rdquo;, said Fettes, at Clarity AI.</p>

<p>The ASEDG is aimed at equipping small to medium enterprises (SMEs) across ASEAN operating within global and local supply chains with a simplified reference guide to report on ESG disclosures to various stakeholders including customers, financiers and investors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It streamlines and consolidates various global ESG frameworks as well as local guidelines and frameworks of each of the ten ASEAN member states into a set of 38 priority disclosures for SMEs to address as reference. &nbsp;It is further categorised into Basic, Intermediate and Advanced, to differentiate the levels of sustainability maturity of each SME. The disclosures are applicable across all industries with different levels of priority, and SMEs are encouraged to determine the significance and relevance of these disclosures to their companies. &nbsp;</p>

<title>Bursa Malaysia Establishes Industry Working Group To Strengthen Cyber Resilience Across The Stockbroking Sector - Timeline Set For Industry-Wide Recommendation Paper</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) today announced the formation of a dedicated industry working group to enhance cyber resilience across the Malaysian stockbroking ecosystem. The establishment of the industry working group is a coordinated action, moving forward from the unauthorised trades incident on 24 April 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed, Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia said, &ldquo;The industry working group represents a concerted effort to strengthen the cyber resiliency of our trading ecosystem. The industry recognises that cyber resiliency is not just a technology best practice &mdash; it is the cornerstone of a trusted and vibrant capital market. A resilient ecosystem safeguards investor confidence, upholds market integrity, and ensures that our digital infrastructure can withstand and adapt to evolving threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The industry working group, chaired by Encik Julian M Hashim, Chief Regulatory Officer of Bursa Malaysia, comprise representatives from four bank-backed Participating Organisations (POs), two non-bank POs and two subject matter experts in the field of cybersecurity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group held its inaugural meeting on 17 June 2025, where it finalised its terms of reference. Its mandate includes: &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Assessing current cybersecurity practices and identifying systemic vulnerabilities within the stockbroking ecosystem; </li>
<li>Developing industry-wide standards and best practices for information and communication technology (ICT) risk management and incident response; </li>
<li>Recommending enhancements to regulatory frameworks and operational protocols to improve cyber resilience. </li>
</ol>
<p>The industry working group targets to finalise its recommendation paper within four months, with the subsequent implementation phase focused on the execution of the recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising the diversity in operational complexity across stockbroking firms, consultation with the industry will be carried out to ensure the recommendation paper is practical and fit for purpose.</p>
<p>The establishment of the industry working group is part of a broader commitment to strengthen the industry&rsquo;s cyber resilience. In recent months, stockbroking firms have adopted precautionary measures such as mandatory password resets, enhanced monitoring of unusual logins, blocking suspicious Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and issuing client alerts to ensure login details are always kept secure.</p>
<p>In line with these efforts, Bursa Malaysia had on 21 May 2025 sent out a directive to mandate that all stockbroking firms implement multi-factor authentication by the end of 2025. This requirement is a critical step towards enhancing the security of investor trading accounts and mitigating the risk of unauthorised access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bursa Malaysia remains committed to safeguarding investor confidence and market stability through proactive regulatory leadership and collaborative action.</p>

<title>Japan Financial Services Agency: Release Of “Second Scenario Analysis On Climate-Related Risks (Banking Sector)”</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-financial-services-agency-release-of-second-scenario-analysis-on-climate-2025620/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/japan-financial-services-agency-release-of-second-scenario-analysis-on-climate-2025620/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="indent">The Financial Services Agency (FSA) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), in cooperation with three major banks, conducted the second scenario analysis on climate-related risks. The FSA and the BOJ have published a report &ldquo;Second Scenario Analysis on Climate-Related Risks (Banking Sector)&rdquo;, which outlines major findings, and issues and challenges drawn from the exercise.</p>
<p class="indent">As in the case of the first scenario analysis (&ldquo;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2022/20220826.html">Pilot Scenario Analysis Exercise on Climate-Related Risks Based on Common Scenarios</a>&rdquo;), the aim of the second scenario analysis was not to quantitatively assess the impact of climate-related risks but to identify issues for future improvement. The analysis assessed the impact on loans (credit risk), which potentially has a large impact on banks' financial conditions. The analysis focused on transition risk analysis, considering the impact in a shorter horizon (7 years) compared with the first scenario analysis. The FSA and the BOJ added a tailored stress scenario by adjusting a NGFS scenario.</p>
<p class="indent">The analytical capability has been further enhanced in the participating banks since the first scenario analysis (e.g., widened coverage of analysis by sector-specific models and improved model documentation). The FSA and the BOJ conducted in-depth dialogues with the banks on issues regarding the use of scenario analysis, exploiting the horizontal review of submitted analysis from the banks.</p>
<p class="indent">Going forward, the FSA and the BOJ will continue dialogue with financial institutions on methods and applications of the scenario analysis, including how to address the issues identified in the first and second scenario analyses.</p>

<title>Japan Financial Services Agency: Practices And Issues On Climate-Related Risk Management～ Building On "Supervisory Guidance On Climate-Related Risk Management And Client Engagement"</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="indent">Since the publication of the &ldquo;<img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/news/2022/20220715/03.pdf">Supervisory Guidance on Climate-related Risk Management and Client Engagement</a>&rdquo; in July 2022, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has maintained dialogues with financial institutions on climate-related risk management and client engagement.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, the FSA published the report which illustrates practices and issues of financial institutions addressing climate-related risks. Those case examples are based on initiatives taken by approximately 20 financial institutions covered in the in-depth dialogue conducted in FY 2024 (from summer 2024 to summer 2025).</p>
<p class="indent">The financial institutions covered in the FY 2024 dialogue consider climate change to be a material issue and have made progress in addressing climate-related risks in a manner suited to their respective size and business characteristics. On the other hand, they face challenges in integrating climate-related risks, which will manifest over the medium and long term, into conventional risk management frameworks. They also have difficulty with temporary increase in financed emissions when they finance their clients to support their transition to net zero.</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA will continue to hold discussions with financial institutions on their risk management and client engagement practices associated with climate change, while taking into account global trends and business environment surrounding them.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Publishes Study On Canadian ETF Market</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-publishes-study-on-canadian-etf-market-2025619/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-publishes-study-on-canadian-etf-market-2025619/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/reports-and-publications/osc-etf-study">detailed study</a>&nbsp;examining the liquidity and arbitrage mechanism of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in Canada.</p>
<p>The OSC ETF study comes as the Canadian market has experienced significant growth over the last ten years, expanding to more than 1,200 ETFs with over $500 billion in assets by the end of 2024. Retail participation in ETFs, including trading activity, has also seen an increase over the last five years.</p>
<p>Despite this substantial growth, there has been limited research on how Canadian ETFs have functioned in recent years. The study focused on three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>ETF secondary market liquidity;</li>
<li>Effectiveness of the arbitrage mechanism in ensuring that ETF market prices reflect their Net Asset Value (NAV); and</li>
<li>Potential drivers of ETF liquidity and the arbitrage mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p>The findings from this study informed the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) consultation on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/8/81-409/csa-consultation-paper-81-409-enhancing-exchange-traded-fund-regulation-proposed-approaches-and">Enhancing Exchange-Traded Fund Regulation</a>. The consultation was published concurrently with this report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ETFs have become popular among a broad spectrum of investors and have proven resilient in the face of recent financial and macroeconomic events,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, CEO of the OSC. &ldquo;By using data-driven insights, we can better tailor policies to protect investors while fostering a robust ETF market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/"><span>http://www.osc.ca</span></a>.</p>

<title>B.C. Court Says Fraudster’s Financial Sanction Will Not Be Erased By Bankruptcy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A $6.8 million financial sanction against a fraudster will not be extinguished if he is discharged from bankruptcy, a B.C. Supreme Court judge has ruled.</p>
<p>The BC Securities Commission (BCSC), which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2016/68-bcsc-panel-permanently-bans-and-issues-financial-sanctions-against-former-registrant-for-fraud">ordered</a>&nbsp;Thomas Arthur Williams to pay the sanction in 2016, had asked that the sanction remain enforceable even if all or most of his other debts are erased by discharge from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The judge granted the BCSC&rsquo;s application based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2024/72-bcsc-calls-for-amending-federal-bankruptcy-law-to-protect-canadian-investors">last year&rsquo;s ruling</a>&nbsp;by the Supreme Court of Canada in another BCSC case. The Supreme Court of Canada said that a type of financial sanction known as disgorgement &ndash; an order to pay money representing the amount obtained or loss avoided by the wrongdoing &ndash; should survive bankruptcy if it was imposed for misconduct involving &ldquo;false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a direct link between the disgorgement order debt and [Williams&rsquo;s] deceitful misconduct,&rdquo; the court said.</p>
<p>A BCSC panel found in 2016 that Williams, who had been a registered mutual fund representative, was the mastermind of a Ponzi scheme that raised approximately $11.7 million from 123 investors between February 2007 and April 2010. The panel found that he committed fraud and violated securities laws concerning prospectus and registration requirements.</p>
<p>Williams, who applied for bankruptcy in 2021, has not paid any portion of the $6.8 million disgorgement order. He opposed the BCSC&rsquo;s application to have the disgorgement survive discharge from bankruptcy, but according to the court, he &ldquo;was unable to provide a reason for why the declaration should not be granted when given an opportunity to do so during the course of the hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any funds collected for disgorgement can be returned to victims of the misconduct.</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s B.C. Supreme Court ruling was the first to use the Supreme Court of Canada&rsquo;s legal test for determining whether a financial sanction should survive discharge from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Canada, in that same 2024 ruling, said that administrative penalties &ndash; which are separate from disgorgement orders, and are aimed at deterring misconduct &ndash; are not enforceable after a discharge from bankruptcy. The court&rsquo;s 5-2 ruling was based on its interpretation of the federal&nbsp;<em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act&nbsp;</em>(BIA), which says that certain types of debts will not be erased after discharge. The court noted that Parliament could have drafted the BIA to expressly say that financial sanctions of regulatory bodies or administrative tribunals are exempt from bankruptcy discharge, but the BIA does not say that.</p>
<p>In response to that ruling, the BCSC has been engaging with elected and appointed federal officials about adding securities regulators&rsquo; financial sanctions to the BIA&rsquo;s list of debts that survive bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In addition to the $6.8 million disgorgement order against Williams, the BCSC also imposed a $15 million administrative penalty. He has not paid any portion of that, either.</p>
<p>Williams sought to be discharged from bankruptcy in 2023. The BCSC and the court-appointed trustee opposed that application, which was adjourned indefinitely.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Secures Convictions For Insider Dealing And Money Laundering Worth £1 Million</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has secured convictions against two individuals, Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi, for insider dealing and money laundering offences which netted them over &pound;1 million.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Redinel Korfuzi worked as a research analyst at an asset management firm. He regularly obtained confidential, price-sensitive information for publicly traded companies as part of his role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 17 December 2019 and 25 March 2021, Mr Korfuzi conspired with his sister, Oerta Korfuzi, to use that confidential information to deal in the shares of at least 13 companies ahead of market announcements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trades were executed through accounts held by Mr Korfuzi&rsquo;s sister, personal trainer (Rogerio de Aquino) and his partner (Dema Almeziad). They used Contracts for Difference (CFDs), taking positions that the value of the relevant shares would go down and closing the positions after the market announcements. The suspicious trading was detected by the FCA&rsquo;s market monitoring systems despite their arrangements, which were designed to conceal Mr Korfuzi&rsquo;s involvement in the trading and to maximise profits.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr and Ms Korfuzi were also convicted of money laundering. Between 1 January 2019 and 25 March 2021 they received dirty cash derived from the proceeds of crime, making 176 cash deposits totalling &pound;198,210. The source of the cash was unrelated to the insider dealing with which they were charged.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Their co‑defendants, Rogerio de Aquino and Dema Almeziad, were acquitted of all charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We are committed to fighting financial crime and protecting the integrity of our markets. Those who use inside information to unlawfully make profits should be aware that we will identify them and bring them to justice.'</p>
<p>Mr and Ms Korfuzi will be sentenced on 4 July 2025. The FCA will also apply for confiscation orders in order to recover the proceeds of crime.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi&rsquo;s date of birth is 20 May 1987.</li>
<li>Oerta Korfuzi&rsquo;s date of birth is 10 September 1988.</li>
<li>Rogerio de Aquino&rsquo;s date of birth is 4 November 1961.</li>
<li>Dema Almeziad&rsquo;s date of birth is 30 January 1985.</li>
<li>The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 gives the FCA powers to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by the Criminal Justice Act 1993.</li>
<li>The individuals were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/five-individuals-face-conspiracy-commit-insider-dealing-and-money-laundering-charges" title="Five individuals face conspiracy to commit insider dealing and money laundering charges">charged</a>&nbsp;in January and February 2023.</li>
<li>As these offences predate 1 November 2021, when the maximum sentence available increased to 10 years, the insider dealing here is punishable by a fine and/or up to 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>The offence of money laundering is punishable by a fine or up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>The prosecution were unable to identify the source of the crime from which the cash derived.</li>
<li>To report market abuse to us or to speak to someone about it, please see our information on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse" title="Market abuse">market abuse</a>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.</li>
<li>The trial was prosecuted by Tom Forster KC of Red Lion Chambers and Tom Broomfield and Katherine Lloyd of QEB Hollis Whiteman Chambers on behalf of the FCA.</li>
<li>Find out more information&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about-us-previous" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">about the FCA</a>.</li>
<li>The court ordered a separate trial in the case for a fifth defendant, Iva Spahiu. Her trial has been fixed for 28 June 2027.&nbsp;Temporary Reporting Restrictions pursuant to s4(2) Contempt of Court Act 1981 are in place to avoid a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in the trial of Ms Iva Spahiu.&nbsp;Consequently, there is to be no further reporting of any evidence concerning the particular involvement of Ms Spahiu.</li>

<title>ESMA Consults On The Methodology For Computing EU Member States’ Market Capitalisation And Market Capitalisation Ratios</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, is&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA12-1406959660-2936_CP_on_draft_RTS_on_market_capitalisation.pdf">consulting</a><span>&nbsp;on the methodology for calculating market capitalisation and market capitalisation ratios, as mandated by the Directive on faster and safer relief of excess withholding taxes (FASTER Directive).&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The FASTER Directive sets out that EU Member States whose market capitalisation exceeds 1.5% of the total EU market capitalisation for four consecutive years will be subject to specific requirements related to withholding tax relief. Additionally, from 2026 ESMA will have to publish the relevant annual figures related to this provision. To support this objective, ESMA is introducing a&nbsp;transparent, consistent and robust framework to determine market capitalisation ratios across EU Member States. ESMA&rsquo;s&nbsp;metrics will be crucial for determining which EU Member States must comply fully with the requirements set out in the FASTER Directive.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The proposed methodology is aligned with existing transparency frameworks and uses transaction data reported under the Regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR). It details the approach to computing share prices, calculating market capitalisation at instrument and company levels, and aggregating these figures to determine each Member State&rsquo;s market capitalisation ratio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The finalised methodology will enable accurate identification of jurisdictions subject to the FASTER Directive&rsquo;s obligations, supporting enhanced tax compliance and reducing fraud risks. Ultimately, it will foster greater trust and efficiency in the EU&rsquo;s capital markets and tax systems, benefiting investors.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps&nbsp;</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESMA will consider the&nbsp;feedback received to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/consultations/consultation-methodology-calculation-market-capitalisation">consultation</a><span>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<span>25 July 2025</span>&nbsp;and expects to publish a Final Report and submit the draft regulatory technical standards to the European Commission for adoption in October 2025.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph">At its annual general meeting today, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) released its financial results for the financial year ending on 31 December 2024, reporting a solid performance in a year marked by a more stable and attractive investment environment for bond investors.</p>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE reported operational revenues of EUR 45.5 million for 2024, an increase of 9% compared with 2023. The operational revenues for 2024 reflect the company&rsquo;s strong listing activity throughout the year, resulting in the highest number of new financial securities admissions in a single year since the exchange started its activities more than 95 years ago. The stock exchange also reported a net profit of EUR 8.1 million for the same period, compared with EUR 10.6 million the year before. The fall in profit is attributable to non-operating profit realised in 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;2024 was an excellent year for the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, with exceptional listing numbers and advancements in the field of trading and data. Our strategic focus on sustainability and digital innovation has not only enhanced our services but also solidified Luxembourg&rsquo;s position as the destination of choice for issuers and investors focused on sustainable, digital or conventional bonds. We are committed to continuing this trajectory and shaping market developments through innovation,&rdquo; commented Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Undisputed bond listing venue</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">In 2024, LuxSE welcomed 15,111 new securities, representing a 9% increase year over year. In total, EUR 1.5 trillion was raised through these new securities, up 19% compared to the previous year, and giving LuxSE a 33% global market share in listed international bonds in 2024. With 44,775 securities admitted on its markets and on the Securities Official List as of 31 December 2024, including more than 41,000 debt instruments, LuxSE reported a 5% increase year over year in the total number of listed securities at year end. The exchange has an expansive international footprint and serves 1,700 issuers across 100 countries.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;In 2024, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange made significant progress on its 4-year strategic plan and continued to play a crucial role as a key pillar of Luxembourg&rsquo;s financial centre. In a global market environment dominated by major exchange groups, we kept building on LuxSE&rsquo;s unique strengths and agility, and the exchange remained the leader in its field. Our focus remains clear, we will continue to strengthen LuxSE&rsquo;s core activities while exploring new fields created by the current market and political context,&rdquo; stated Alain Kinsch, President of the Board of Directors of LuxSE.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Global sustainable debt issuance on the rise</b><b></b></p>
<p class="paragraph">After a record year for sustainable bond issuances in 2021 and a subsequent slowdown, 2024 saw an increase in sustainable bond issuance globally. This was reflected on the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX), which added 664 new green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds in 2024, a 19% increase compared to the year before.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The new GSSS bonds on LGX raised a total of EUR 262 billion in 2024 for specific green and social projects and sustainable developments across the world, representing a 25% increase compared to 2023, and giving LuxSE a global market share of 42% in international sustainable bond listings. LGX reached an important milestone at the beginning of 2024, when it passed the EUR 1 trillion mark in outstanding GSSS bonds on the LGX Platform. At year end, LGX encompassed 2,199 GSSS bonds in total, up 17% year over year.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Key developments in 2024</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">In 2024, LuxSE introduced LuxSE Partner, a dedicated partnership status designed for law firms and professional services firms supporting issuers in navigating the issuance and listing process. The status will enable deeper collaboration across the ecosystem, and ultimately ease the listing process for issuers. LuxSE also streamlined its admission process FastLane to include 7 non-European markets. Companies with shares listed on any of these markets benefit from a simplified listing process for their bonds on LuxSE. On the trading side, LuxSE completed the migration of its clearing activities to Euronext Clearing and onboarded new prime liquidity providers. Moreover, LuxSE reported a 65% growth in sales of sustainable bond data compared to 2023.</p>
<p class="paragraph">In recognition of LuxSE&rsquo;s contribution to digital innovation in capital markets, LuxSE was named the leading exchange for DLT bonds by OMFIF in its Digital Assets 2024 report. Throughout 2024, LuxSE accelerated its digital transformation, which included the multiyear revamp of LuxSE&rsquo;s core listing system and integration of AI-based solutions in its operations.</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Sustainability report 2024 released </b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Along with its financial results, LuxSE also published its Sustainability Report 2024. The report reflects the progress made towards the three pillars of the exchange&rsquo;s sustainability strategy, namely climate transition, education and gender equality, and describes how LuxSE is embedding its sustainability strategy into its operations and business strategy. In 2024, LuxSE kept a strong focus on advancing gender finance.</p>

<title>FSB Examines Vulnerabilities In Non-Bank Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>FSB identifies liquidity mismatches, leverage, and valuation opacity as the main vulnerabilities in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and property funds.</span></li>
<li><span>Report also notes complex interlinkages between banks and non-bank CRE investors, which increases the potential for spillovers from CRE market shocks.</span></li>
<li><span>Report underscores the importance of closing data gaps to enhance authorities&rsquo; ability to monitor risks from non-banks&rsquo; involvement in CRE.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/06/vulnerabilities-in-non-bank-commercial-real-estate-investors/">report analysing the vulnerabilities in non-bank commercial real estate investors</a>. The report builds on the findings of the 2024 FSB&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/depositor-behaviour-and-interest-rate-and-liquidity-risks-in-the-financial-system-lessons-from-the-march-2023-banking-turmoil/">report on interest rate and liquidity risks in the financial system</a>, which identified non-bank CRE investors &ndash; comprising real estate investment trusts (REITs), property funds, and other non-bank mortgage lenders &ndash; as one of the entity types vulnerable to higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Data from FSB members suggests banks and nonbanks collectively provided at least $12 trillion in equity and debt financing to CRE in 2023. While banks remain the main source of such financing, non-bank investors &ndash; particularly property funds and REITs &ndash; play a significant role in some jurisdictions. The report identifies three main vulnerabilities in these investors:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a><span>Liquidity mismatches:&nbsp;</span>Some open-ended property funds show significant liquidity mismatches and may therefore be vulnerable to runs. There have been a number of instances in recent years where such funds, in the face of significant investor redemption requests, introduced gates or suspended redemptions due to illiquidity in the underlying market. Implementing the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;</a><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/revised-policy-recommendations-to-address-structural-vulnerabilities-from-liquidity-mismatch-in-open-ended-funds/">recommendations on addressing liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds</a>&nbsp;would help to address this vulnerability.</li>
<li><span>High financial leverage:&nbsp;</span>There are pockets of high financial leverage in some REITs and property funds. A decline in property valuations or an inability to roll over maturing debt could lead to forced deleveraging that can propagate across the CRE market.</li>
<li><span>Opacity in valuations of CRE assets:&nbsp;</span>The CRE market is illiquid, and it may therefore be difficult to price assets and collateral, especially in times of stress. Delayed loss recognition due to infrequent valuations and lenders&rsquo; loan modification practices can lead to abrupt losses in a prolonged downturn. The report notes that enhancing transparency and ensuring that investors take account of valuation uncertainty in their risk management practices could help mitigate this vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also highlights the complex interlinkages between banks and non-bank CRE investors. Banks are the main debt providers to, and can also invest in, REITs and property funds. Banks may also have common asset exposures to these investors, which increases the potential for shocks to the CRE market spilling over to the banking sector. A more complete overview of these interlinkages is limited by considerable data gaps, despite improvements in recent years. Closing some of these gaps would enhance authorities&rsquo; ability to monitor risks.</p>
<p>So far, the global financial system has weathered the recent adverse developments in the CRE market. This can be attributed to the market&rsquo;s heterogeneity; lower loan-to-value levels than previous episodes of stress; and the ability of some distressed borrowers to refinance. However, ongoing monitoring of the market is warranted given the more volatile performance of CRE exposures compared to other assets, structural shifts in demand, and the effects of extreme weather events and new energy efficiency standards in some jurisdictions.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<h2 class="stat-intro exclude-navigation">Current Bank Rate -&nbsp;<span class="stat-figure">4.25%</span></h2>
<p class="stat-caption">Next due: 7 August 2025</p>
<h2>Monetary Policy Summary, June 2025</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>At its meeting ending on 18 June 2025, the MPC voted by a majority of 6&ndash;3 to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Three members preferred to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%.</p>
<p>There has been substantial disinflation over the past two years, as previous external shocks have receded, and as the restrictive stance of monetary policy has curbed second-round effects and stabilised longer-term inflation expectations. This has allowed the MPC to withdraw gradually some degree of policy restraint, while maintaining Bank Rate in restrictive territory so as to continue to squeeze out existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Underlying UK GDP growth appears to have remained weak, and the labour market has continued to loosen, leading to clearer signs that a margin of slack has opened up over time. Measures of pay growth have continued to moderate and, as in May, the Committee expects a significant slowing over the rest of the year. The Committee remains vigilant about the extent to which easing pay pressures will feed through to consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>Twelve-month CPI inflation increased to 3.4% in May from 2.6% in March, in line with expectations in the May Monetary Policy Report. The rise was largely due to a range of regulated prices and previous increases in energy prices. Consumer price inflation is expected to remain broadly at current rates throughout the remainder of the year before falling back towards target next year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, global uncertainty remains elevated. Energy prices have risen owing to an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The Committee will remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic and geopolitical environment, and will continue to update its assessment of risks to the economy.</p>
<p>There remain two-sided risks to inflation. Given the outlook, and continued disinflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate. Monetary policy is not on a pre-set path. At this meeting, the Committee voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%.</p>
<p>The Committee will continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence may reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy will need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The Committee will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 18 June 2025</h2>
<p>1: Before turning to its immediate policy decision, the Committee discussed: the international economy; monetary and financial conditions; demand and output; and supply, costs and prices.</p>
<h3>The international economy</h3>
<p>2: UK-weighted global GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.4% in 2025 Q1, in line with the projection in the May Monetary Policy Report. Since the MPC&rsquo;s May meeting, the US administration had made progress in negotiating trade deals with the United Kingdom and China. The reduction in tariffs with China had reduced the US average effective tariff rate by just over a third. However, the future configuration of tariffs remained highly uncertain, with potential changes in tariff policy continuing to pose risks to global trade. Indices of trade policy uncertainty had also remained at elevated levels.</p>
<p>3: The impact of trade policies had been evident in activity data. For example, GDP and trade releases suggested that exports to the United States had been expedited ahead of tariffs taking effect. On the one hand, euro-area GDP had grown by a stronger-than-expected 0.6% in 2025 Q1, accounted for by strong exports and investment, and GDP in China had expanded by 1.2%, supported by net exports. On the other hand, US GDP had contracted by 0.1%, weaker than had been anticipated, as imports had significantly outstripped exports. There had also been some tentative evidence over recent months that goods from China destined for the United States were being shipped to other countries, including to Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>4: More timely PMI data had suggested some further front-loading of activity in the euro area with strong manufacturing PMIs but softer services PMIs in May, although front-loading was expected to unwind over the second quarter as a whole. In the United States, consumer confidence and investment intentions indicators had rebounded in May, although ISM manufacturing PMIs had been softer. The US House of Representatives had passed a fiscal bill with significant tax cuts. These were broadly in line with what had been incorporated in the May Report forecast. The bill had yet to be passed by the Senate.</p>
<p>5: The euro-area labour market had remained tight but had continued to gradually normalise, while the labour market in the United States had remained close to balance. Unemployment in these regions had remained low compared to historic averages. Indicators of pay growth had continued to moderate.</p>
<p>6: Annual headline consumer price inflation had continued to decrease in the euro area and in the United States. In the euro area, there was growing evidence that the 2021-2022 inflationary shock had been largely squeezed out of the system. Twelve-month HICP inflation had decreased to 1.9% in May, marginally below what had been expected in the May Report, while core inflation had also fallen to 2.3%. Lower services price inflation had accounted for the decrease in the headline figure. In the United States, CPI inflation had risen slightly to 2.4% in May, and core inflation had remained at 2.8%. There were few signs of tariffs impacting the latest US inflation data but some measures of short and medium-term household inflation expectations had continued to rise, possibly reflecting the anticipated impact of tariffs.</p>
<p>7: The Committee discussed cross-country trends in inflation. Both wage growth and consumer services price inflation had remained at more elevated levels in the United Kingdom than in the euro area or the United States. While in part reflecting greater persistence of inflation in the United Kingdom, for services, some of that difference could be accounted for by the greater contribution of regulated prices to UK inflation recently. Any such comparisons also needed to take account of differences in cyclical and structural factors.</p>
<p>8: The Brent oil spot price had increased by 26% to $79 per barrel since the MPC&rsquo;s May meeting, in part reflecting an escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran. European natural gas spot prices had also increased by 11%. Non-oil commodities prices were little changed.</p>
<h3>Monetary and financial conditions</h3>
<p><a id="_Hlk201159588"></a>9: Some measures of global financial market volatility had fallen back since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting, although they had remained elevated overall in light of continuing geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty. Across advanced economies, government bond yields had been little changed overall. At the short end of the curve, yields had initially risen following the May MPC meeting, accounted for partly by an easing in tariffs between the United States and China, although they had subsequently fallen back following data releases. At the long end of the curve, initial increases had been associated with an increase in term premia related to the fiscal outlook in a number of economies, before those yields had also fallen back.</p>
<p>10: Equity prices had recovered in these economies since their declines following the US administration&rsquo;s tariff announcement in April. The US dollar effective exchange rate had depreciated further and was around 5% weaker than its level prior to the April tariff announcement, with some investors diversifying into, or hedging dollar exposures using, other currencies. This had contributed to the relative strength in the euro effective exchange rate.</p>
<p>11: At its meeting on 5 June, the ECB Governing Council had announced a 25 basis point reduction in its interest rates, in line with market expectations. At its May meeting, the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Federal Open Market Committee had maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25 to 4.5%.</p>
<p>12: Consistent with moves in other advanced economies, gilt yields had initially risen and then fallen back, while UK equity prices were slightly higher since the MPC&rsquo;s previous meeting. There had been a small appreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate. In the Bank&rsquo;s latest Market Participants Survey (MaPS), the median profile for CPI inflation implied a peak of 3.4% in the third quarter of this year, a slight increase relative to expectations in the previous survey. The median respondent had continued to expect inflation to be at the 2% target at the three-year horizon. There had been little change in medium-term UK financial market inflation compensation measures.</p>
<p>13: Market expectations were for Bank Rate to remain unchanged at this meeting. The median MaPS respondent was expecting 50 basis points of Bank Rate cuts this year, unchanged from the May survey and broadly in line with what was implied by market pricing. The distribution of Bank Rate expectations had shifted upwards relative to the May survey, consistent with the relatively shallower profile of cuts implied by market pricing, albeit with market contacts continuing to emphasise ongoing economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>14: Underlying trends in money and credit data had been consistent with the assessment set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, though with some recent and temporary volatility associated with the bringing forward of house purchases ahead of increases in the Stamp Duty Land Tax that had come into effect in April. Given market-implied expectations for a shallower profile of Bank Rate since the MPC's previous meeting, quoted rates on some mortgage rates had increased slightly, consistent with a pace of pass-through in line with historical experience.</p>
<h3>Demand and output</h3>
<p>15: UK GDP had increased by 0.7% in 2025 Q1, a little stronger than had been expected in the May Monetary Policy Report. Household consumption had risen by 0.2%, while business investment had increased by 5.9% following a weak 2024 Q4 outturn. Net trade excluding valuables was estimated to have made a positive contribution to quarterly growth, of 0.6 percentage points, while the change in inventories had contributed 0.2 percentage points to growth. Both of these components of GDP could have been affected by a front-loading of activity ahead of the imposition of new tariffs by the United States and related trade policy developments.</p>
<p>16: Monthly GDP had fallen by 0.3% in April, following fairly strong increases over previous months. The latest data appeared to have been affected by the front-loading of activity ahead of the increases in Stamp Duty Land Tax and in Vehicle Excise Duty in April. There had also been some evidence that the temporary boost to trade ahead of the imposition of new tariffs had unwound, with goods exports to the United States recording their largest ever monthly fall in April. Overall, the monthly path of output suggested that quarterly GDP growth was likely to fall back to around &frac14;% in 2025 Q2, slightly higher than had been expected at the time of the May Report.</p>
<p>17: Business surveys had continued to point to weak underlying GDP growth. For example, although the S&amp;P Global UK composite PMI output index had risen to above 50 in May, it had remained some way below its historical average. Textual analysis of PMI responses by Bank staff suggested that global concerns had played a larger role in its weakness over recent months, relative to domestic factors. That said, most companies responding to the latest DMP Survey were not expecting tariffs to have a material impact on their sales and investment, and had judged that uncertainty around US tariffs fell between April and May. Agents&rsquo; intelligence suggested that business sentiment had continued to wane, with contacts not expecting to see a material recovery in demand until 2026. Taken together, the steer from surveys over recent months had remained consistent with a zero to slightly positive pace of underlying growth currently.</p>
<p>18: The Committee discussed the divergent signals on the strength of activity over recent months. Surveys had historically tended to give a less volatile steer on GDP growth, but they could also be affected excessively by swings in sentiment that were not ultimately reflected in firms&rsquo; output. Recent developments in output also needed to be considered in the wider context of the supply side of the economy, and the opening up of slack in the labour market and within companies. The Committee was continuing to monitor indicators of UK economic uncertainty and its impact on investment decisions.</p>
<p>19: Spending Review 2025 had agreed departmental settlements within the envelope for total government spending that had been confirmed at the Spring Statement in March. Budgets had now been set until 2028‑29 for day-to-day resource spending and until 2029-30 for capital spending.</p>
<h3>Supply, costs and prices</h3>
<p>20: Issues with the quality of the official data, including relating to the labour market, continued to be an area of concern for the MPC. The Committee therefore continued to draw on a wide range of information beyond the official data to inform its judgements on the conjuncture. These sources included business surveys and intelligence from the Bank&rsquo;s Agents.</p>
<p>21: Several indicators of labour demand and firms&rsquo; hiring intentions had softened further in recent months. The ONS/HMRC PAYE estimate of payrolled employees had fallen by 0.4% in the three months to May, with a single-month decline of 109,000 in May that had been the largest monthly contraction since May 2020. Revisions to early vintages of the HMRC data could be large and, given the earlier timing of the data extraction for May, the latest HMRC data were more uncertain than usual. That said, survey-based measures of the labour market, such as the employment component of the S&amp;P Global UK composite PMI, the permanent staff placements component of the KPMG/REC Report on Jobs and the latest Agents&rsquo; intelligence on recruitment difficulties, corroborated this pattern of ongoing loosening. A measure of underlying employment growth developed by Bank staff continued to suggest a subdued rate of near-zero employment growth.</p>
<p>22: The ratio of vacancies to unemployment had continued to fall below Bank staff&rsquo;s estimate of its equilibrium level. The net additional hours desired by workers, as a percentage of average hours worked, had risen to its highest level since March 2015 in 2025 Q1. The overall weakening in these early-stage indicators of the tightness of the labour market suggested that some modest deterioration in late-stage indicators, such as the unemployment rate and the redundancy rate, should be expected over the coming months. Churn in the labour market had remained subdued, with outflows from unemployment gradually edging lower. Taken together, the analysis conducted by Bank staff implied that slack was continuing to emerge in the labour market but there were no strong signs, as yet, that a more abrupt loosening was underway.</p>
<p>23: A broad set of indicators suggested that underlying pay growth had eased further in recent months, albeit to a still elevated level and above what could be explained by economic fundamentals. Private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth had fallen to 5.1% in the three months to April, down from 5.5% in March. Annual pay growth in retail and hospitality had been 6.7% in April, in line with the increase in the National Living Wage. Higher-frequency estimates of AWE growth continued to indicate an annualised run-rate of around 5%. The timelier ONS/HMRC PAYE proxy for private sector pay had edged lower from 5.8% in April to 5.7% in May.</p>
<p>24: The latest data on pay settlements and pay expectations had remained on track with the May Monetary Policy Report projection for a significant decline in wage growth. Data from the Bank of England&rsquo;s and Brightmine&rsquo;s settlements databases suggested that the median rate of pay awards had remained at around 3 to 4% since the start of the year, although these estimates had continued to be based on incomplete samples. The latest intelligence from the Agents had continued to suggest average pay settlements for 2025 of 3.5 to 4%, consistent with the range reported in the Agents&rsquo; annual pay survey that had been conducted ahead of the February Report. The MPC continued to monitor closely the flow of pay settlements information and other data that would enhance the Committee&rsquo;s visibility on the prospective path of pay growth.</p>
<p>25: Twelve-month CPI inflation had been 3.4% in May, following 2.6% in March and 3.5% in April. The rise since March had largely been due to a range of regulated prices and previous increases in energy prices. The April CPI release had triggered the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that was being published alongside these minutes. The May outturn had been in line with expectations in the May Report. Core CPI inflation had been 3.5% in May, around 0.2 percentage points lower than expectations at the time of the May Report.</p>
<p>26: The ONS had announced in June that an error had been identified in an extract of the licensed vehicles data provided to the ONS by the Department for Transport. These data had been used to calculate the April 2025 Vehicle Excise Duty component of consumer price inflation. The error had resulted in an overstatement of the headline CPI by 0.1 percentage points for the published April 2025 figure only. The error had been corrected in the May data, such that going forward only the year-on-year rate of CPI inflation in April of next year would be distorted.</p>
<p>27: Core consumer goods price inflation had risen to 1.6% in May, alongside a material increase in food consumer price inflation, to 4.4%. Meat, chocolate and non-alcoholic drinks had exhibited the strongest inflation rates, consistent with higher wholesale prices for beef, cocoa beans and coffee. Agency intelligence had also highlighted the impact of labour and packaging regulation costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>28: Consumer services price inflation had returned to 4.7% in May, having risen from that level in March to 5.4% in April. Underlying services price inflation had remained elevated across a broad range of measures, regardless of whether they were based on exclusionary, trimming or reweighting approaches. While these had been on a downward trajectory, there had been little change in the higher-frequency pace of underlying services price inflation since late 2024.</p>
<p>29: CPI inflation was expected to remain just under 3&frac12;% for the remainder of the year, with a brief increase to 3.7% in September. This profile was broadly unchanged from the projection made at the time of the May Report, although the pass-through to prices from National Insurance contributions, from regulatory changes and from some food input costs continued to require monitoring.</p>
<p>30: Some indicators of households&rsquo; short- and medium-term inflation expectations had fallen back in the latest data, but had remained at the upper end of the range of rates explicable by the path of consumer price inflation. The Citi/YouGov measure of median one-year ahead inflation expectations had declined to 4.0%, while the Bank/Ipsos measure had fallen to 3.2%. The increases in household expectations prior to the latest data could be explained by the response of households to actual inflation, in particular to increases in the prices of salient items such as food and energy prices. Nevertheless, this represented an upside risk to future pay and inflation dynamics. Medium-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys had also remained elevated.</p>
<p>31: Measures of businesses&rsquo; inflation expectations had remained elevated but to a lesser extent than household measures. According to the DMP Survey, businesses&rsquo; year-ahead own-price expectations had fallen from 4.0% in the three months to February to 3.7% in the three months to May. Year-ahead CPI expectations had stood at 3.2%, up slightly from 3.1% in the three months to February.</p>
<h3>The immediate policy decision</h3>
<p>32: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.</p>
<p>33: The Committee considered the news since the previous MPC meeting, particularly the extent to which it was sufficient to change members&rsquo; views on domestic inflationary pressures and hence the required stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>34: Underlying UK GDP growth appeared to have remained weak and the labour market had continued to loosen. While there remained uncertainties around the balance of supply and demand in the economy, there was clearer evidence that a margin of slack had opened up over time in the labour market as had been expected. Members noted the continuing weakness in job vacancies, in the ratio of vacancies to unemployment relative to its estimated equilibrium level, and in ONS/HMRC PAYE payrolls even with less weight placed on the most recent data point, alongside the increase in net additional hours desired by workers.</p>
<p>35: Measures of pay growth had continued to moderate and, as in May, the Committee expected a significant slowing over the rest of the year. This was consistent with the now-more-representative sample of recorded pay settlements this spring, and with the broadly unchanged signals from the DMP Survey and Agents&rsquo; intelligence. The growing margin of slack in the labour market pointed to limited pay drift going forward. The Committee remained vigilant about the extent to which easing pay pressures would feed through to consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>36: Twelve-month CPI inflation had increased to 3.4% in May from 2.6% in March, in line with expectations in the May Monetary Policy Report. The rise had been largely due to a range of regulated prices and previous increases in energy prices. Services price inflation had been unchanged from March, at 4.7%. Food price inflation had risen materially in May, which might prove salient for households&rsquo; formation of inflation expectations. There had been some signs of levelling off in indicators of household expectations, but both household and business inflation expectations remained elevated. Financial market measures of inflation compensation were in contrast more subdued.</p>
<p>37: Consumer price inflation was expected to remain broadly at current rates throughout the remainder of the year before falling back towards target next year. While base effects would start to work to bring inflation down in 2025 Q4 and 2026 Q1, more pronounced disinflation was needed to ensure CPI inflation declined back towards the 2% target consistent with the baseline projection in the May Report.</p>
<p>38: The Committee remained focused on returning inflation sustainably to the target. Alongside the baseline forecast, the May Report had set out two illustrative scenarios. In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation. In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically. The mechanisms underlying both scenarios remained relevant for the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations, set alongside a broader assessment of risks.</p>
<p>39: Recent developments had highlighted a broad range of global risks, including but not restricted to trade policy. Global uncertainty remained elevated.</p>
<p>40: Based on the latest constellation of tariff announcements, provisional Bank staff analysis suggested that the direct impact of the trade shock on world GDP could be smaller than the Committee had expected in the May Report. Trade policy uncertainty would nevertheless continue to have an impact on the UK economy.</p>
<p>41: There had been rapid geopolitical developments in the lead up to this MPC meeting. Energy prices had risen owing to an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The Committee would remain vigilant about these developments and their potential impact on the UK economy.</p>
<p>42: Although monetary policy had been eased over the past year, the Committee had retained a restrictive stance in order to continue to squeeze out persistent inflationary pressures. There was a range of views among members on the remaining degree of restrictiveness.</p>
<p>43: All members stressed that monetary policy was not on a pre-set path. The Committee would remain sensitive to heightened unpredictability in the economic and geopolitical environment, and would continue to update its assessment of risks to the economy.</p>
<p>44: Six members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Disinflationary progress had continued, but there was not a strong case for a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk200880019"></a>Inflation seemed likely to stay around 3&frac12;% over the second half of 2025 before falling back towards the target from next year. There had generally been some greater signs of disinflationary pressures from the labour market, both in terms of quantities and wages, than from developments in domestic prices. Recent global developments had not had a significant impact on this meeting&rsquo;s policy decision.</p>
<p>45: The risks around the medium-term path of CPI inflation remained two-sided. Assessing the pace of disinflation would continue to be key for these members in reaching a view on how quickly to remove remaining policy restraint. That assessment was likely to include a number of elements. Signs of weak demand, for example as a result of continued high saving, could lead to a more rapid opening up of slack in the labour market. In contrast, supply side constraints, such as continued weakness in productivity, or structural change in goods and labour markets could contribute to inflationary pressures. Inflation persistence could also be generated by higher food prices raising inflation expectations, impacting wage and price setting behaviours.</p>
<p>46: Three members preferred a 0.25 percentage point reduction in Bank Rate at this meeting. The cumulative evidence from a range of labour market data pointed to a material further loosening in labour market conditions. Private sector regular wage growth had come in lower than expected, while incoming pay settlements data had continued to be close to the Agents&rsquo; annual pay survey figure for the end of 2025, and were approaching sustainable rates. Consumer spending and underlying growth had remained subdued, alongside ongoing risks to global growth. The disinflation process was continuing, with the most significant contributions to the pickup in headline inflation coming from one-off tax and administered prices, though with uncertainty from global developments that needed monitoring. In the medium term, a continued monetary policy stance that was too restrictive risked inflation deviating from the 2% target on a sustained basis and the opening up of an unduly large output gap. Given this balance of risks, a less restrictive policy path was warranted.</p>
<p>47: Given the outlook, and continued disinflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remained appropriate. The Committee would continue to monitor closely the risks of inflation persistence and what the evidence might reveal about the balance between aggregate supply and demand in the economy. Monetary policy would need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further. The Committee would decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.</p>
<p>48: The Chair invited the Committee to vote on the proposition that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank Rate should be maintained at 4.25%.</li>
</ul>
<p>49: Six members (Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Megan Greene, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill) voted in favour of the proposition. Three members (Swati Dhingra, Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor) voted against the proposition, preferring to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%.</p>
<h3>Operational considerations</h3>
<p>50: On 18 June, the stock of UK government bonds held for monetary policy purposes was &pound;590 billion.</p>
<p>51: The following members of the Committee were present:</p>

<title>Worldline Reveals Eight Critical Payment Trends Shaping The Future Of Mobility - Enhanced Payment Options, Changing Commuter Habits, Open Payment Systems And Artificial Intelligence Are Listed In A White Paper</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/worldline-reveals-eight-critical-payment-trends-shaping-the-future-of-mobility-2025619/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, has published a mobility payments white paper outlining the most significant trends that underpin how agile payment solutions can deliver smarter, more sustainable experiences. With global public transportation systems undergoing significant transformation driven by evolving passenger expectations, rapid technological innovation, tougher sustainability goals and the move towards more flexible work patterns, the report highlights the eight key trends shaping the future of payments.</span></p>
<p>With more than half of the world&rsquo;s population now living in cities and the United Nations projecting this to rise to nearly 70% by 2050, transportation lies at the heart of the modern urban experience yet often lags behind other sectors when it comes to consumer technology, particularly in the area of payments.</p>
<p>With an accelerated transition from the traditional five-day commute and the rise of contactless payments in retail environments, the expectations of transportation users have advanced rapidly and significantly. According to Statista, contactless transaction value is growing at double-digit annual rates in many markets, reflecting a growing consumer preference for speed, convenience and safety.</p>
<h2>The eight key trends identified within the white paper:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ever-growing wave of new digital payment options and the need to moving beyond cash and proprietary smart cards to bank-issued contactless cards and mobile wallets.</li>
<li>The development of multi-modal and integrated ticketing points to a future where planning and payment for bus and train, e-scooter and ride-share can happen in a single unified environment.</li>
<li>The transition from fixed commuter passes to&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk199941285" name="_Hlk199941285"></a>Pay as You Go (PAYG) and&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk199941395" name="_Hlk199941395"></a>Account-Based Ticketing (ABT) caters to changing work habits, offering travellers flexibility and convenience while providing Transportation Authorities (TAs) with valuable data on demand patterns.</li>
<li>Open payments systems promise frictionless travel by enabling the use of credit and debit cards at fare gates, reducing barriers to entry for tourists and infrequent riders.</li>
<li>Data-driven service optimisation and personalised marketing help TAs enhance efficiency, improve route planning and engage riders with targeted offers.</li>
<li>Self-service terminals maintain their importance by catering to passengers who still prefer physical payment points while also evolving through the incorporation of touchscreens and contactless modules.</li>
<li>Sustainability remains a central goal with green initiatives, loyalty rewards and carbon tracking tools being integrated into next-generation payment platforms.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being deployed to transform many aspects of public transportation, especially in enhancing customer service, improving operational efficiency, boosting engineering effectiveness and adding new layers of safety and security.<br />In particular, the white paper findings indicate that companies are more likely to invest in applied AI than in other leading-edge technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>R&eacute;mi Maeno, Head of Energy, Mobility and Self-Service verticals at Worldline Merchant Services</b>, commented: &ldquo;The trends identified in this white paper clearly demonstrate the importance of agile payment solutions in public transportation&rsquo;s future. By modernising legacy systems, enabling interoperability and offering user-centric design, transportation authorities can reduce operational costs, increase ridership and minimise their environmental footprint. By taking on board the actionable recommendations contained within the white paper, they will be able to improve and accelerate their modernisation journey significantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To maximise success, TAs need to ensure they have the right partnerships in place with banks and payment providers and coordinate their efforts to ensure minimal transaction fees and smooth settlement processes. TAs need scalable, modular payment solutions that support multiple payment options for a range of transportation services &ndash; especially as cities expand and mobility needs evolve. Payment solutions need to ensure fast, secure access to data while supporting multiple identifiers to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience for passengers.</p>
<h2>We are the only European payment actor covering the whole mobility payment chain</h2>
<p>Public Transportation Authorities face growing challenges in modernizing aging ticketing systems, meeting passenger demand for speed and convenience. Worldline, a global payment leader and open payment provider across Europe, offers concrete solutions including eCommerce and acquiring services, advanced payment terminals.</p>
<p>As the public transportation industry moves towards more agile, sustainable, and digital ticketing and payment methods, it will benefit from working with payment solution providers that place a high priority on interoperability, flexibility and user-centric design.

It is noteworthy that other regions also experienced relatively higher declines compared to the APAC region.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, South and Central America saw their respective deal volume fall by around 4%, 6%, 9% and 12% YoY during January-May 2025.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Some APAC markets have shown promising growth, indicating a nuanced environment for investors and businesses alike. Meanwhile, the resilience of certain deal types, particularly M&amp;A, has also provided a silver lining in an otherwise challenging landscape.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The number of M&amp;A deals announced in the APAC region has shown a modest increase, rising by around 4% YoY during the first five months of 2025. This uptick suggests that companies are actively eyeing acquisitions to bolster their market positions amid economic uncertainties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Conversely, private equity and venture financing deal volumes have experienced a decline, with their respective deal volumes drop by nearly 10% and 8% YoY. This reduction highlights a cautious approach among PE/VC firms, which seem to be reassessing their investment strategies in light of the fluctuating market conditions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A closer examination of key markets reveals a mixed bag of performance. China, traditionally the top APAC market, has experienced a decline, with deal volume falling by around 8% YoY. In contrast, India and Japan have emerged as bright spots with YoY increase in deal volume of around 7% and 23%, respectively. Meanwhile, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia faced challenges, with their deal volumes registering decline.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: "While the overall APAC deal landscape has faced slight downturn and challenges persist, the growth in M&amp;A activity and the resilience of markets like India and Japan highlight the region's potential.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<title>United States Files Civil Forfeiture Complaint Against $225M In Funds Involved In Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud Money Laundering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="text-align-justify">The Department of Justice filed a civil forfeiture complaint today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against more than $225.3 million in cryptocurrency. According to the complaint, law enforcement used blockchain analysis and other investigative techniques to determine that the cryptocurrency is connected to the theft and laundering of funds from victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, commonly referred to as &ldquo;cryptocurrency confidence scams.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The complaint alleges that the cryptocurrency addresses that held the over $225.3 million in cryptocurrency were part of a sophisticated blockchain-based money laundering network that executed hundreds of thousands of transactions and was used to disperse proceeds of cryptocurrency investment fraud across many cryptocurrency addresses and accounts on the blockchain to conceal the source of the illegally obtained funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s civil forfeiture complaint is the latest action taken by the Department to protect the American public from fraudsters specializing in cryptocurrency-based scams, and it will not be the last,&rdquo; said Matthew R. Galeotti, Head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;These schemes harm American victims, costing them billions of dollars every year, and undermine faith in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Our investigators and prosecutors are relentlessly pursuing these scammers and their ill-gotten gains, and we will relentlessly pursue recovery of victim funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">&ldquo;Under my leadership, with the support of President Trump and Attorney General Bondi, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Columbia is taking a leading role in the fight against crypto-confidence scams, partnering with law enforcement throughout the country to seize and forfeit stolen funds and rip them from the hands of foreign criminals, all with the eye toward making victims whole,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">"The forfeiture of these illicit funds is a powerful tool in the FBI&rsquo;s toolbox to stop the fraudsters who are operating online from stealing from the American people," said Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI Criminal Division. "The FBI will not standby while these criminals target unsuspecting victims who believe they are making legitimate investments. The hard work of the FBI and our partners continues as we work with victims and potential victims across the country to put an end to these scams and warn others about their devastating effects."</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">&ldquo;This seizure of $225.3 million in funds linked to cryptocurrency investment scams marks the largest cryptocurrency seizure in U.S. Secret Service (USSS) history,&rdquo; said Special Agent in Charge Shawn Bradstreet of the USSS San Francisco Field Office. &ldquo;These scams prey on trust, often resulting in extreme financial hardship for the victims. The USSS, FBI, and our private partners worked diligently to trace these illicit transactions, identify victims and seize these funds so that they can eventually be returned to their rightful owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">As part of the investigation of the laundering network, over 400 suspected victims are believed to have lost funds after being duped into believing that they were making legitimate cryptocurrency investments. The complaint recounts millions of dollars in victim losses. According to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center&rsquo;s 2024 Internet Crime Report, cryptocurrency investment fraud caused more than $5.8 billion in reported losses in 2024 alone. The USSS San Francisco Field Office and FBI San Francisco Field Offices investigated the case. The Department of Justice thanks Tether for its proactive assistance in this investigation.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Trial Attorneys Stefanie Schwartz and Ethan Cantor of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Computer Crime &amp; Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kevin Rosenberg and Rick Blaylock Jr. for the District of Columbia are handling the matter.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Members of the public who believe they are victims of cryptocurrency investment fraud and other cyber-enabled crime should contact the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">www.ic3.gov</a>. If you believe you may be a victim of one of the scams alleged in the government&rsquo;s complaint, add the code &ldquo;BT06182025&rdquo; in the narrative of your complaint, and if you have previously filed a related complaint, make note of the prior complaint in the narrative.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The former director of a B.C.-based cannabis company that illegally distributed securities has been banned for six years and has paid $5,000 to the BC Securities Commission (BCSC) for<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/enforcement/administrative-enforcement/settlements/2025/christine-mah-order-and-settlement-agreement" target="_blank">&nbsp;her misconduct</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>B.C. resident Christine Mah was a&nbsp;</span><span>director of RoccaVerde Wellness Corporation between November 2018 and March 2019.

<p><span>All of the investors lost all of their money.</span></p>
<p><span>Mah participated in the illegal distributions, including being responsible for the day-to-day internal financial operations of RoccaVerde, maintaining the general ledger for the corporation and depositing investor payments. She also admitted that she did not take any steps to ensure that the company complied with the prospectus requirements in B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act.</em></span></p>
<p><span>In addition to paying the BCSC $5,000, Mah is also banned for six years from participating in the investment market. During that time she faces various restrictions, including that she cannot be a registrant, a promoter, or a director or officer of any issuer, and she cannot trade securities except in her own account through a registered dealer.</span></p>
<p><span>Mah has never been registered under the Act and has no history of securities misconduct. She cooperated with staff throughout the investigation and expressed remorse for her misconduct.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Scammers Used Deceptive Facebook Ads to Lure Russian-Speaking New Yorkers into Investing with Fake Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms</span></li>
<li>Over 100 Fraudulent Domains Seized; Some Victims Were Warned Early, Others to Be Made Whole</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, together with New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services Adrienne Harris, today announced that a multi-agency long-term investigation resulted in the disruption of a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment scam that targeted members of the Russian community in Brooklyn and across the country.&nbsp; Stolen cryptocurrency was sent to domain registrars as payment to create fake cryptocurrency investment domains and to Meta as payment for Facebook advertisements that promoted fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. After learning of the investigation, Meta shut down more than 700 accounts associated with the &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertiser promoting the scam. Court orders have led to the seizure of $140,000 worth of cryptocurrency, the freezing of approximately $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency, and the dismantling of a cluster of scam websites and registrar accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>District Attorney Gonzalez said</span>, &ldquo;As crypto scams continue to proliferate, it is crucial for law enforcement agencies to work together in order to stop them. That&rsquo;s what happened in this case, with the fraudulent network being shut down, victims warned to stop investing and some of the stolen money getting recovered. I am grateful for the partnership with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Department of Financial Services that led to this successful outcome. My office will continue to investigate every reported scam in Brooklyn and to educate residents about how to protect themselves from these dangerous frauds.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of New York investors thought they were putting their hard-earned money in safe, high-return investments, only to be defrauded out of millions of dollars,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said</span>&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;These scammers targeted Russian speakers on Facebook with enticing ads and my office together with DFS and the Brooklyn District Attorney&rsquo;s office took action to stop these scammers and protect New Yorkers. I urge all New Yorkers to be vigilant of online cryptocurrency investment ads.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>New York State Department of Financial Services&nbsp;<span>Superintendent Adrienne Harris said</span>, &ldquo;Through partnership and collaboration with the Brooklyn District Attorney and New York Attorney General, hundreds of thousands of dollars were returned to victims and these criminals were held accountable for their deplorable actions. As a preeminent global regulator of cryptocurrency, banks, insurers, and other financial services providers, the Department will continue to work every day to build a more equitable, transparent, and resilient financial system for all New Yorkers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The investigation began in October 2024 when NYDFS became aware that a fake cryptocurrency investment website was displaying what looked like a BitLicense certificate, purportedly issued by the agency (these certificates are issued to legitimate virtual currency businesses operating in New York to ensure compliance with state laws, consumer protection and transparency). The first site NYDFS identified was WhalesTrade.com and further investigation revealed that the domain name was linked to a large network of related domains and accounts that were part of a scam campaign targeting Russian-speaking residents of Brooklyn and across the state and country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The scammers involved in this scheme lured victims with deceptive social media ads, many in Russian and primarily on Facebook, featuring popular names and personalities. Once victims showed interest in investing, scammers responded and moved the conversation to encrypted private messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. After the victims made an initial investment on the fraudulent platforms, scammers then falsely showed the victims that their investment accounts were increasing in value and encouraged victims to send more money. After making more investments, sometimes totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, victims were unable to withdraw their funds and were told they needed to pay more in false withdrawal fees or taxes. Eventually, the scammers cut off contact with the victim and pocketed their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the course of the investigation, more than 300 victims were identified, and many were personally contacted by Brooklyn District Attorney and New York State Department of Financial Services investigators and alerted to the fraud so that they would stop sending funds to fake investment platforms. It&rsquo;s estimated that the scheme caused over $1 million in losses in Brooklyn alone. To disrupt the scheme and prevent future harm, the DA&rsquo;s Office executed a series of warrants that resulted in the seizure of over 100 domains and 17 registrar accounts; terminated scammers&rsquo; access to their web-based email, effectively disconnecting their communications with victims; seized $140,000 that was stolen from victims that can now be returned; and was able, with NYDFS, to monitor blockchain activity in real time and warn dozens of victims who had just started engaging with the scammers, preventing the future loss of funds. In addition, DA Gonzalez appeared in Russian media to explain these types of frauds and advise community members on how to protect themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The scammers targeted Russian speakers by launching a campaign of advertisements on Facebook which promised high returns on cryptocurrency investments. To avoid revealing their real identity to Facebook and to evade restrictions on misleading and fraudulent advertisement, the scammers paid individuals based in Vietnam for &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertising services. &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertising on Facebook refers to deceptive online tactics used to promote services that violate Facebook&rsquo;s advertising policies. The investigation revealed that the scammers used over a million dollars&rsquo; worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims to pay &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertisers for the placement of the deceptive advertisements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General joined the investigation, focusing on the payment of funds to the &ldquo;Facebook Black Hat&rdquo; advertisers. Their investigation revealed that a &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertiser was converting Bitcoin sent by victims into local Vietnamese currency, which was used to purchase more fraudulent ads on Facebook. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The OAG successfully obtained a court order to freeze $300,000 in cryptocurrency accounts linked to the &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Residents of New York who want to verify the legitimacy of a cryptocurrency exchange or file a complaint about a cryptocurrency company, product, or service can visit the DFS website, visit <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/complaint" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dfs.ny.gov/complaint</a> or call (800) 342-3736. DFS continues to set the bar for prudential regulation of virtual currency, protecting consumers; preserving markets; and rooting out financial crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing.  &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>New Yorkers who have been affected by deceptive conduct in cryptocurrency markets should also report the conduct to OAG&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://ag.ny.gov/financial-fraud-complaint-form" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">by filing an online complaint</a>. Brooklyn residents who believe they&rsquo;ve been scammed are encouraged to report to the DA&rsquo;s Office by calling 718-250-2340. Attorney General James also encourages workers in the cryptocurrency industry who may have witnessed misconduct or fraud to file an&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://ag.ny.gov/i-want/use-whistleblower-portal" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">online whistleblower complaint</a>, which can be done anonymously.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<title>US Deputy Secretary Of The Treasury Faulkender Lays Out Guiding Principles For Bank Secrecy Act Modernization</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-deputy-secretary-of-the-treasury-faulkender-lays-out-guiding-principles-for-b-2025618/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-deputy-secretary-of-the-treasury-faulkender-lays-out-guiding-principles-for-b-2025618/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Michael Faulkender spoke at the 62nd Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG)plenary meeting organized by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). At this public-private partnership event, Deputy Secretary Faulkender discussed the Trump Administration&rsquo;s guiding principles for Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) modernization.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>Key Excerpts of Remarks as Prepared for Delivery</span></h3>
<p>I want to clearly articulate the guiding principles that Treasury will continue to use to inform the Trump Administration&rsquo;s regulatory agenda and its BSA modernization efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, regulation should derive from a clear statutory mandate, including safety and soundness, mitigating material risk to financial stability, and consumer protection.</p>
<p>Second, regulation should be efficient, striking an appropriate balance between costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Third, regulation should be fair and objective, and there should be clarity and consistency in the industry across entities and time.</p>
<p>Fourth, regulators themselves should be efficient in mitigating risk and in the use of taxpayers&rsquo; hard-earned dollars.&nbsp; There should be transparency in their actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the regulatory reform process, we intend to focus heavily on the second principle: ensuring that we find the optimal fulcrum for balancing the somewhat opposing forces of costs and benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When evaluating the costs and burdens of a given regulatory action, we recognize both the direct and indirect costs, including the potential for unintended consequences and the burdens that it can place on the private sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This balancing act requires a careful tailoring of regulatory actions, keying off the risk profiles of the various firms affected and their different business models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking a look at the BSAAG members in this very room, we have representatives from a range of financial institutions&mdash;large, midsize, and small, bank and non-bank alike.&nbsp; You may also notice something different this plenary. We&rsquo;ve changed the membership to double the number of small community banks to reflect the Administration&rsquo;s commitment of putting Main Street first.</p>
<p>Each institution provides different products and services that may be vulnerable to varying kinds of risks.&nbsp; That is why we are providing more opportunities for our Main Street financial institutions to have a stronger voice on regulatory reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A reinvigorated BSA system must recognize these differences in meaningful ways. An approach that we may deem necessary for a large institution with an expansive risk profile may be unnecessarily burdensome for a smaller one with a more limited risk profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognize that there is an urgent need to modernize the implementation of the AML/CFT regime in the United States so that it is effective, risk-based, and focused on the greatest threats to financial institutions and national security.&nbsp; To that end, I have directed my team to work with financial regulators and other stakeholders to move expeditiously to make progress on our modernization efforts.&nbsp;BSAAG members will be a critical part of this effort, and we value your feedback and input to this process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our BSA modernization efforts, Treasury is working to change the AML/CFT status quo so that the framework focuses on our national security priorities and highest risk areas and explicitly permits financial institutions to de-prioritize lower risks.&nbsp; In line with the AML Act&rsquo;s directive, this includes an acknowledgement that financial institutions must be permitted to direct more attention and resources toward higher-risk customers and activities, consistent with an institution&rsquo;s risk profile, rather than toward lower-risk customers and activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As many here know, the Trump Administration strongly supports the AML Act&rsquo;s core purpose of modernizing the AML/CFT laws to better align the government and private sector response to new and emerging threats.&nbsp; Our vision for a modernized BSA regulatory and supervisory regime is one where financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>comply with AML/CFT laws and regulations;</li>
<li>are examined for the risk-based and reasonably designed nature of their AML/CFT programs and set of internal controls;</li>
<li>direct more resources to the higher-risk areas to U.S. national security and fewer resources to lower-risk areas; and</li>
<li>generate highly useful information for law enforcement and national security agencies in priority areas defined by Treasury.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Another area where we need to modernize the BSA regime is reporting, especially the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) and Currency Transaction Report (CTR).&nbsp; SARs and CTRs provide critical intelligence for our law enforcement partners to protect national security by combatting drug cartels, human traffickers and smugglers, fraudsters, and terrorists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Treasury recognizes the burden this reporting imposes on industry and that it is critical for institutions to be able to direct their compliance resources towards the most significant threats to national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the specific topic of SARs, Treasury is currently exploring ways to streamline SAR reporting, including by improving the form itself, which will be beneficial for law enforcement and national security agencies, as well as financial institution filers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am happy to report that Treasury is pursuing similar efforts on CTRs.&nbsp;Treasury recognizes that the CTR filing burden imposed on industry is substantial, and that it is critical for institutions to have the ability to direct their compliance resources towards the most significant threats to national security.</p>
<p>Treasury is also working to ensure we encourage financial institutions to responsibly innovate, including exploring ways to enhance how suspicious activity is identified, investigated, and reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that FinCEN has already consulted extensively with law enforcement and national security agencies; financial institutions, including BSAAG members; as well as financial regulators, in support of the effort to increase the efficiency of CTR and SAR filings.</p>
<p>We recognize that financial institutions are eager for more feedback on how all this reporting is used, which is critical to ensuring the effectiveness of CTR and SAR reporting and something we hope to provide.</p>
<p>Modernizing the AML/CFT regime not only includes updating rules, streamlining reporting, and improving feedback; it also involves a commitment from the Trump Administration to innovation.&nbsp; I understand that the AML Act required the creation of two specific BSAAG Subcommittees: the Innovation and Technology Subcommittee and the Information Security and Confidentiality Subcommittee.&nbsp; The Administration is committed to promoting responsible financial innovation, including related to the use of digital assets. And I know the BSAAG subcommittees will continue to contribute thoughtful ideas on innovation as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, a core feature of the reforms in the AML Act is the important role of public-private partnerships in combating national security threats and financial crime.&nbsp; The BSAAG is, of course, one of Treasury&rsquo;s premier and long-established public-private partnerships.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for April 2025. The next release, which will report on data for May 2025, is scheduled for July 17, 2025.</p>
<p>The sum total in April of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC outflow of $14.2 billion. Of this, net foreign private inflows were $3.1 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $17.3 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in April; their net sales were $50.6 billion. Net sales by private foreign investors were $20.5 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $30.1 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents decreased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $42.8 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign sales of long-term securities are estimated to have been $7.8 billion in April.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $12.0 billion. Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $7.7 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $14.1 billion.</p>

<h3>About TIC Data</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data. These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy. For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data. The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries. In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data. For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>US Treasury Endorses New International Payments Standards, Supports FATF Reports On Countering Illicit Finance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-endorses-new-international-payments-standards-supports-fatf-reports-2025618/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On June 13, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) concluded its joint plenary with the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL), the FATF-style regional body for Europe, in Strasbourg, France. The plenary agreed to release reports on proliferation financing sanctions evasion typologies and how terrorist groups like Hamas, Hizballah, and the Houthis raise and move funds. The body also found consensus on a revised payments standard, new publications on how countries around the world are regulating virtual assets to combat illicit finance, and a new mechanism to prevent the FATF standards from being misused to pressure civil society groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FATF plays an important role in the global fight to counter terrorism and proliferation financing,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent</span>. &ldquo;We are encouraged by the FATF&rsquo;s adoption of reports that respond to private sector demand for more actionable information to combat financial crime as well as modernizing its standards for domestic and cross-border payments.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Terrorist Financing Report</h3>
<p>The FATF endorsed its first update for major global terrorist financing trends and risks in a decade. The report included input from over 80 countries and will help the public and private sectors better understand the nature of global risks, trends, and methodologies related to the &nbsp;<br />financing of terrorism, including both United Nations (UN)-designated groups and non-UN designated groups. It will aid governments and financial institutions in identifying and cutting off from the international financial system groups such as Hamas, Hizballah, and the Houthis.</p>
<h3>Proliferation Financing Report</h3>
<p>The task force also endorsed a new report on proliferation financing and sanctions evasion. Following the dissolution of the UN 1718 Panel of Experts last year, the FATF began work on a project that culminated with 40 case studies and typologies about how illicit actors associated with Iran, North Korea, and Russia evade sanctions. The report highlights how North Korea raises revenue for its weapons of mass destruction program. The report, to be issued soon, will inform how the public and private sectors assess and mitigate relevant proliferation financing risks in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Recommendation 16</h3>
<p>The FATF updated its standard for domestic and cross-border payments. The revision modernizes the standard by recognizing the role of non-bank financial institutions in payments and seeks to promote transparency and efficiency in cross-border payments. The revisions will assist financial institutions in combating fraud and sanctions evasion and respond to the G20 call for faster, more transparent, and efficient payments. The FATF will work on guidance for governments and the financial sector to implement the standard, which will go into effect no later than 2030, and establish a working group with the private sector to solicit feedback on the guidance and implementation.</p>
<h3>Virtual Asset Reports</h3>
<p>FATF members agreed to publish two reports on virtual assets. One highlights progress in implementation of the FATF standards for virtual assets, in particular for countries with substantial virtual asset activities, and the other outlines good practices for supervising Recommendation 16 for virtual assets. The reports indicate progress across the global network in spurring innovation and in regulating virtual assets to manage illicit finance risks, while noting only modest progress on supervision and enforcement actions related to misuse of virtual assets by criminal actors. The FATF will continue to promote implementation of the FATF standards for virtual assets by all countries, discuss emerging threats in the virtual asset ecosystem, and develop resources through targeted projects to support effective implementation.</p>
<h3>Addressing the Unintended Consequences of the FATF Standards</h3>
<p>The FATF approved procedural changes to address the misapplication of the FATF standards that stifle the legitimate activities of non-profits. With the amended procedures, the FATF will now be able to better assess and address cases of countries disrupting non-profit and humanitarian activities under the guise of anti-money laundering/countering terrorist financing controls. Treasury was closely involved in the development and approval of this project, which has been a top priority for the current Mexican presidency of the FATF.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Good morning. Thank you for the kind invitation to deliver keynote opening remarks at the RegHub Summit and to join TradingHub Executive Chair Neil Walker for a fireside chat. I appreciate that you have historically had the pleasure of hearing from the most senior regulators in our industry including our immediate past Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman, Russ Behnam; President and CEO of the National Futures Association, Tom Sexton; and a recent past Director of Enforcement, Ian McGinley.</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;ll hope to offer insights to complement the important and cutting edge topics that you will explore today including managing model risk in trade surveillance, best practices for validation and compliance, and building a unified approach to trade surveillance and data governance. Mostly, I&rsquo;ll aim to be brief and, if I am correctly using these idioms, not put a foot wrong or let the side down. To that end, I should acknowledge that that the views I express today are my own and not the views of the Commission, my fellow Commissioners or the staff of the CFTC.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Three Dimensions of a Financial Markets Governance and Compliance Framework</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Financial regulation in the U.S. significantly depends on a three-dimensional approach to regulatory compliance.</span></p>
<p><span>First, from the earliest periods of community or state-based regulation in the U.S.&mdash;which only go as far back as the late 1700s&mdash;you could argue that our regulation has required entities operating in financial markets to police themselves. In other words, market participants must demonstrate a commitment to ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and reporting instances of disruption or compliance failures.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, our regulation imposes both formal and informal (soft law) requirements on firms operating as critical market infrastructure resources. These entities, and in some instances, industry trade associations, have exercised market policing authority. In 1792, for example, twenty-four stock-brokers gathered under a buttonwood tree in lower Manhattan in New York City to sign the Buttonwood Agreement.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a><span>&nbsp;While I am fairly certain they were not sorting out a crypto regulatory framework, addressing complex issues such as initial and variation margin requirements during periods of heightened market distress, default risk management, cross-product margining, or clearing U.S. Treasuries, they were establishing a precedent that would serve as a foundational understanding in U.S. financial markets regulation: firms and industry have obligations to facilitate market stability, market integrity, and surveil markets for evidence of fraud and manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span>Third, financial market regulators play an important role in supervising markets and enforcing expectations regarding compliance. At the CFTC, our principles-based regulation includes a supervision framework where organizations that play a critical role in market infrastructure, such as exchanges and clearing organizations, engage in surveillance and report to the Commission on the compliance of intermediaries.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Within individual organizations, registered market participants are charged with supervising the actors who directly engage in trading as well as actors who directly engage in customer solicitation.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Relying on firms to engage in market surveillance and intermediaries to engage in supervision balances the costs and obligations of&nbsp;supervision. We might describe the three legs of this regulatory framework as a governance and compliance framework.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Technology-Driven Governance and Compliance&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In recent years, the advent of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have promised to enable faster, more efficient, reduced cost supervision and compliance capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span>This observation is not a revelation to anyone in this room. For decades, financial markets have integrated machine learning algorithms as a central aspect of predictive analytics. Increasingly advanced AI technologies&mdash;supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, neural networks, generative AI and more recently agentic AI&mdash;have accelerated both interest in and adoption of AI for broader front office, back office, reporting, and supervision and monitoring obligations that arise in financial markets regulation.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Requests for Information Regarding the Adoption of AI: CFTC, Federal Regulators, and Global Initiatives</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Over the last several years, I have worked closely with our Commission, other federal regulators, regulators around the world, and market participants to understand the benefits and limits of integrating AI into financial markets compliance and surveillance infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span>I actively worked with the CFTC senior staff across all divisions to develop the Commission&rsquo;s first request for comment (RFC) on the uses of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been a priority of mine to engage with the staff, as well as our registrants, about issues related to AI long before that RFC, and remains so to this date. Compliance use cases were identified by a number of market participants as AI uses in CFTC-registered markets.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a><span>&nbsp;This is consistent with a trend that has been identified in financial markets more broadly. &nbsp;I also worked directly or participated in the development of consultations organized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and global international standard setting bodies seeking to better understand AI compliance and surveillance use cases.</span></p>
<p><span>Many industry trade associations are similarly engaged in better understanding the potential for AI use cases. The Institute of International Finance (IIF), for example, surveys its members annually about its uses of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the most recent IIF survey report, published in January 2025, compliance (including anti-money laundering and trade surveillance) ranked in the top four predictive AI use cases for respondents.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Treasury&rsquo;s report on Artificial Intelligence in Financial Markets reports that &ldquo;AI is widely used for&hellip;AML/CFT and sanctions compliance, including analyzing large sets of data, detecting anomalies, flagging suspicious activities, and verifying customer identities under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Other publications contain similar observations about compliance use cases as AI adoption in financial services continues to develop.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a></p>
<p><span>A recent consultation report published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on AI in capital markets reports that IOSCO members and self-regulatory organizations&nbsp;(SROs) observed that market participants are:</span></p>
<p><span>using AI to enhance the effectiveness of AML and CFT measures, particularly, and compliance more generally, including to identify suspicious transactions. For AML compliance, customer onboarding, and due diligence, respondents observed that market participants use ML models to perform pattern recognition and anomaly detection in surveillance software. They also use NLP to enhance the interpretation of unstructured data and to facilitate name screening and news analysis.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a></p>
<p><span>The IOSCO Report also noted that other recent reports had consistent findings, and cited numerous industry reports about how large language models (LLMs) are used for compliance tasks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>AI and Trade Surveillance</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Indisputably, AI technologies demonstrate significant potential for enhancing trade surveillance. The recent IOSCO Report referenced earlier notes the incorporation of &ldquo;AI tools in surveillance and security solutions that could assist market participants to monitor client communications such as emails, calls, and mobile chat applications, and could raise alerts on suspicious communications for compliance review and investigation.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a></p>
<p><span>One of the reasons that the markets that the CFTC regulates are the deepest and most liquid in the world is that our regulatory framework includes measures designed to ensure the integrity of the markets, a necessary feature for markets that so many rely on to hedge and manage risk.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) sets forth core principles for designated contract markets (DCMs) that require DCMs to &ldquo;establish, monitor, and enforce&rdquo; compliance with a DCM&rsquo;s rules and to establish and enforce certain rules and procedures to ensure financial stability of transactions on the DCM.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The implementing rules for each of these core principles include requirements related to surveillance. Rule 38.156 requires a DCM to &ldquo;maintain an automated trade surveillance system capable of detecting and investigating potential trade practice violations&rdquo; and includes additional requirements for the system including certain capabilities, features and timing.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Rule 38.604 states that &ldquo;A designated contract market must monitor members' compliance with the designated contract market's minimum financial standards and, therefore, must routinely receive and promptly review financial and related information from its members, as well as continuously monitor the positions of members and their customers.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Similarly, Section 5h of the CEA establishes compliance with rules and financial integrity as core principles for swap execution facilities (SEFs),</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span>[15]</span></a><span>&nbsp;and implementing rules include requirements on SEFs to maintain an automated trade surveillance system pursuant to Rule 37.203 as part of their required rule enforcement program.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a></p>
<p><span>These are just a few examples, and perhaps one of the many reasons that it is not surprising to me that CFTC-regulated markets have always been among the most technology-forward, including with its use of AI.</span></p>
<p><span>I continuously advocate for a number of policy initiatives related to AI, and the first one is the most fundamental: collaboration. I hope to continue to be able to learn how we can work together to discover how AI can be leveraged to enhance registrants&rsquo; ability to comply with our existing requirements, and to support a stronger, safer, and more vital derivatives market, while also enhancing efficiencies for registrants.</span></p>
<p><span>A discussion of potential uses of AI in the derivatives markets requires also considering the broader financial market landscape. The IOSCO Report noted that respondents &ldquo;observed efforts to enhance surveillance measures in the financial industry through the development of joint systems that can be used by multiple financial institutions to share data and intelligence to mitigate types of threats utilizing AI and other technologies.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span>[17]</span></a></p>
<p><span>I have advocated for a number of policy initiatives related to AI consistently throughout my time at the Commission, and one of those policies is inter-governmental collaboration with other financial market regulators in the U.S. and globally. If we do not work together, we risk missing out on significant opportunities not only to learn from each other and build on best practices, but also opportunities to create broader initiatives that make our markets safer and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A Pause to Look Under the Hood</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As we consider the possibilities, we also need to be mindful of the risks. As AI tools become further integrated into organizational processes, especially those that relate to critical compliance or surveillance functions, those organizations, as well as regulators, need to have appropriate assurances that the tools will operate safely and reliably.</span></p>
<p><span>It is imperative that we have a clear understanding of and appropriate guardrails to ensure the security and integrity of the data used to train AI models. Data governance must be a foundational, gatekeeping issue for the continued development of AI models, particularly LLMs that may rely on synthetic data. I have frequently raised concerns regarding these risks&mdash;including concerns regarding the potential for AI models to hallucinate or lack the ability to comprehend certain real-world roadblocks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span>[18]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Agentic AI models, while able to overcome some of the limitations of generative AI models, are still limited by the data they are able to access.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span>[19]</span></a><span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also spoken about some of the other questions that need to be accounted for as we consider the integration of AI into financial markets, such as promoting explainability, implementing data controls and measures to address bias, focusing on governance of the models, and testing and monitoring output.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><span>[20]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Market participants must understand the risks of data leakage which may include reduced accuracy, unfairness and bias, data privacy breaches, and other vulnerabilities.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span>[21]</span></a><span>&nbsp;I am hopeful that these are among the issues that participants at the Summit will explore today.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Where Are We Going Next?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Increasingly, I am asked this question on a frequent basis. In the context of AI, I believe there is significant potential for these technologies to enhance the tripartite approach to regulation&mdash;my earlier reference to three-dimensions or a three-legged stool of governance and compliance mentioned. Successful integration of AI will require careful consideration by firms and the industry as well as thoughtful regulatory oversight by domestic and international regulators. For a few hundred years, we have been on a journey to create a sound regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p><span>My personal journey in service is not nearly as long but I am deeply committed to ensuring that we land on the right path as we integrate and potentially regulate AI. In becoming a CFTC Commissioner, I have had the privilege and the pleasure of fulfilling a personal professional goal&mdash;serving my country in a role that I hope fosters a healthy economy that enables responsible innovation, protects customers, and ensures the integrity and stability of financial markets for generations to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for being on this journey with me. I look forward to continuing the conversation with you all today and in the coming years.</span></p>

<div>
<p>Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, together with New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services Adrienne Harris, today announced that a multi-agency long-term investigation resulted in the disruption of a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment scam that targeted members of the Russian community in Brooklyn and across the country.&nbsp; Stolen cryptocurrency was sent to domain registrars as payment to create fake cryptocurrency investment domains and to Meta as payment for Facebook advertisements that promoted fraudulent cryptocurrency investment opportunities. After learning of the investigation, Meta shut down more than 700 accounts associated with the &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertiser promoting the scam. Court orders have led to the seizure of $140,000 worth of cryptocurrency, the freezing of approximately $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency, and the dismantling of a cluster of scam websites and registrar accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>District Attorney Gonzalez said</span>, &ldquo;As crypto scams continue to proliferate, it is crucial for law enforcement agencies to work together in order to stop them. That&rsquo;s what happened in this case, with the fraudulent network being shut down, victims warned to stop investing and some of the stolen money getting recovered. I am grateful for the partnership with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Department of Financial Services that led to this successful outcome. My office will continue to investigate every reported scam in Brooklyn and to educate residents about how to protect themselves from these dangerous frauds.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of New York investors thought they were putting their hard-earned money in safe, high-return investments, only to be defrauded out of millions of dollars,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said</span>&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;These scammers targeted Russian speakers on Facebook with enticing ads and my office together with DFS and the Brooklyn District Attorney&rsquo;s office took action to stop these scammers and protect New Yorkers. I urge all New Yorkers to be vigilant of online cryptocurrency investment ads.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>New York State Department of Financial Services&nbsp;<span>Superintendent Adrienne Harris said</span>, &ldquo;Through partnership and collaboration with the Brooklyn District Attorney and New York Attorney General, hundreds of thousands of dollars were returned to victims and these criminals were held accountable for their deplorable actions. As a preeminent global regulator of cryptocurrency, banks, insurers, and other financial services providers, the Department will continue to work every day to build a more equitable, transparent, and resilient financial system for all New Yorkers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The investigation began in October 2024 when NYDFS became aware that a fake cryptocurrency investment website was displaying what looked like a BitLicense certificate, purportedly issued by the agency (these certificates are issued to legitimate virtual currency businesses operating in New York to ensure compliance with state laws, consumer protection and transparency). The first site NYDFS identified was WhalesTrade.com and further investigation revealed that the domain name was linked to a large network of related domains and accounts that were part of a scam campaign targeting Russian-speaking residents of Brooklyn and across the state and country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The scammers involved in this scheme lured victims with deceptive social media ads, many in Russian and primarily on Facebook, featuring popular names and personalities. Once victims showed interest in investing, scammers responded and moved the conversation to encrypted private messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. After the victims made an initial investment on the fraudulent platforms, scammers then falsely showed the victims that their investment accounts were increasing in value and encouraged victims to send more money. After making more investments, sometimes totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, victims were unable to withdraw their funds and were told they needed to pay more in false withdrawal fees or taxes. Eventually, the scammers cut off contact with the victim and pocketed their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the course of the investigation, more than 300 victims were identified, and many were personally contacted by Brooklyn District Attorney and New York State Department of Financial Services investigators and alerted to the fraud so that they would stop sending funds to fake investment platforms. It&rsquo;s estimated that the scheme caused over $1 million in losses in Brooklyn alone. To disrupt the scheme and prevent future harm, the DA&rsquo;s Office executed a series of warrants that resulted in the seizure of over 100 domains and 17 registrar accounts; terminated scammers&rsquo; access to their web-based email, effectively disconnecting their communications with victims; seized $140,000 that was stolen from victims that can now be returned; and was able, with NYDFS, to monitor blockchain activity in real time and warn dozens of victims who had just started engaging with the scammers, preventing the future loss of funds. In addition, DA Gonzalez appeared in Russian media to explain these types of frauds and advise community members on how to protect themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The scammers targeted Russian speakers by launching a campaign of advertisements on Facebook which promised high returns on cryptocurrency investments. To avoid revealing their real identity to Facebook and to evade restrictions on misleading and fraudulent advertisement, the scammers paid individuals based in Vietnam for &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertising services. &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertising on Facebook refers to deceptive online tactics used to promote services that violate Facebook&rsquo;s advertising policies. The investigation revealed that the scammers used over a million dollars&rsquo; worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims to pay &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertisers for the placement of the deceptive advertisements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General joined the investigation, focusing on the payment of funds to the &ldquo;Facebook Black Hat&rdquo; advertisers. Their investigation revealed that a &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertiser was converting Bitcoin sent by victims into local Vietnamese currency, which was used to purchase more fraudulent ads on Facebook. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The OAG successfully obtained a court order to freeze $300,000 in cryptocurrency accounts linked to the &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Residents of New York who want to verify the legitimacy of a cryptocurrency exchange or file a complaint about a cryptocurrency company, product, or service can visit the DFS website, visit <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/complaint" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dfs.ny.gov/complaint</a> or call (800) 342-3736. DFS continues to set the bar for prudential regulation of virtual currency, protecting consumers; preserving markets; and rooting out financial crimes like money laundering and terrorist financing.  &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>New Yorkers who have been affected by deceptive conduct in cryptocurrency markets should also report the conduct to OAG&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://ag.ny.gov/financial-fraud-complaint-form" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">by filing an online complaint</a>. Brooklyn residents who believe they&rsquo;ve been scammed are encouraged to report to the DA&rsquo;s Office by calling 718-250-2340. Attorney General James also encourages workers in the cryptocurrency industry who may have witnessed misconduct or fraud to file an&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://ag.ny.gov/i-want/use-whistleblower-portal" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">online whistleblower complaint</a>, which can be done anonymously.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced that her office took action to stop a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment scam that targeted hundreds of Russian-speaking New Yorkers in Brooklyn and across the country. A joint investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the Brooklyn District Attorney&rsquo;s Office, and the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), found that Vietnam-based scammers defrauded victims by luring them with deceptive social media ads in Russian that claimed big returns on cryptocurrency and other investments. The scammers convinced more than a hundred victims to purchase cryptocurrency and invest it into fake trading platforms, then stole the victims&rsquo; assets and disappeared. After learning of the investigation, Meta shut down more than 700 accounts associated with an advertiser promoting the scam. The OAG&nbsp;<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/attorney-general-of-the-state-of-new-york-v-duong-vin-an-et-al-order-2025.pdf">secured a court order freezing $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency</a>&nbsp;linked to the scammers, and the Brooklyn District Attorney&rsquo;s Office seized an additional $140,000 worth of cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For June 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-announces-enforcement-actions-for-j-2025618/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-NE-2025-18.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement with Carver Federal Savings Bank</a>,</span>&nbsp;New York, New York, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning and earnings performance. (Docket No. AA-NE-2025-18)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-CE-2025-22.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement with Sterling Federal Bank, FSB,</a></span>&nbsp;Sterling, Illinois, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, capital planning, credit administration, and liquidity risk management. (Docket No. AA-CE-2025-22)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-SO-2025-32.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement with Texas Heritage National Bank,</a></span>&nbsp;Daingerfield, Texas, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to strategic planning, capital planning, liquidity risk management, interest rate risk management, concentration risk management, the allowance for credit losses, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those relating to reports of condition and independent audit. (Docket No. AA-SO-2025-32)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-SO-2025-28.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition against William Shane Garrow,</a></span>&nbsp;former Private Banker at BOKF, N.A., Tulsa, Oklahoma, for misappropriating over $3 million from bank customers&rsquo; accounts for his personal benefit. (Docket No. AA-SO-2025-28)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-17.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition against Amilcar A. Sanchez,</a></span>&nbsp;former Branch Operations Manager and ATM Custodian at a Long Island City, New York, branch of Santander Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for stealing, embezzling, or otherwise misappropriating $370,000 from the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-17)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-35.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Order Terminating two Graham-Leach-Bliley Act Agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,</span>&nbsp;</a>Sioux Falls, South Dakota, both dated September 15, 2015 (#<a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2015-105.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2015-105</a>&nbsp;and #<a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2015-106.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2015-106</a>). The two GLBA Agreements related to the bank&rsquo;s non-compliance with certain requirements for controlling or holding an interest in financial subsidiaries. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-35)</li>

<title>CFTC: Keynote Remarks Of Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson At RegHub Summit London 2025: The Future Of Finance: Enabling AI Tools To Enhance Compliance And Surveillance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Good morning. Thank you for the kind invitation to deliver keynote opening remarks at the RegHub Summit and to join TradingHub Executive Chair Neil Walker for a fireside chat. I appreciate that you have historically had the pleasure of hearing from the most senior regulators in our industry including our immediate past Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman, Russ Behnam; President and CEO of the National Futures Association, Tom Sexton; and a recent past Director of Enforcement, Ian McGinley.</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;ll hope to offer insights to complement the important and cutting edge topics that you will explore today including managing model risk in trade surveillance, best practices for validation and compliance, and building a unified approach to trade surveillance and data governance. Mostly, I&rsquo;ll aim to be brief and, if I am correctly using these idioms, not put a foot wrong or let the side down. To that end, I should acknowledge that that the views I express today are my own and not the views of the Commission, my fellow Commissioners or the staff of the CFTC.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Three Dimensions of a Financial Markets Governance and Compliance Framework</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Financial regulation in the U.S. significantly depends on a three-dimensional approach to regulatory compliance.</span></p>
<p><span>First, from the earliest periods of community or state-based regulation in the U.S.&mdash;which only go as far back as the late 1700s&mdash;you could argue that our regulation has required entities operating in financial markets to police themselves. In other words, market participants must demonstrate a commitment to ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and reporting instances of disruption or compliance failures.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, our regulation imposes both formal and informal (soft law) requirements on firms operating as critical market infrastructure resources. These entities, and in some instances, industry trade associations, have exercised market policing authority. In 1792, for example, twenty-four stock-brokers gathered under a buttonwood tree in lower Manhattan in New York City to sign the Buttonwood Agreement.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a><span>&nbsp;While I am fairly certain they were not sorting out a crypto regulatory framework, addressing complex issues such as initial and variation margin requirements during periods of heightened market distress, default risk management, cross-product margining, or clearing U.S. Treasuries, they were establishing a precedent that would serve as a foundational understanding in U.S. financial markets regulation: firms and industry have obligations to facilitate market stability, market integrity, and surveil markets for evidence of fraud and manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span>Third, financial market regulators play an important role in supervising markets and enforcing expectations regarding compliance. At the CFTC, our principles-based regulation includes a supervision framework where organizations that play a critical role in market infrastructure, such as exchanges and clearing organizations, engage in surveillance and report to the Commission on the compliance of intermediaries.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Within individual organizations, registered market participants are charged with supervising the actors who directly engage in trading as well as actors who directly engage in customer solicitation.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Relying on firms to engage in market surveillance and intermediaries to engage in supervision balances the costs and obligations of&nbsp;supervision. We might describe the three legs of this regulatory framework as a governance and compliance framework.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Technology-Driven Governance and Compliance&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In recent years, the advent of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have promised to enable faster, more efficient, reduced cost supervision and compliance capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span>This observation is not a revelation to anyone in this room. For decades, financial markets have integrated machine learning algorithms as a central aspect of predictive analytics. Increasingly advanced AI technologies&mdash;supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, neural networks, generative AI and more recently agentic AI&mdash;have accelerated both interest in and adoption of AI for broader front office, back office, reporting, and supervision and monitoring obligations that arise in financial markets regulation.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Requests for Information Regarding the Adoption of AI: CFTC, Federal Regulators, and Global Initiatives</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Over the last several years, I have worked closely with our Commission, other federal regulators, regulators around the world, and market participants to understand the benefits and limits of integrating AI into financial markets compliance and surveillance infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span>I actively worked with the CFTC senior staff across all divisions to develop the Commission&rsquo;s first request for comment (RFC) on the uses of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been a priority of mine to engage with the staff, as well as our registrants, about issues related to AI long before that RFC, and remains so to this date. Compliance use cases were identified by a number of market participants as AI uses in CFTC-registered markets.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a><span>&nbsp;This is consistent with a trend that has been identified in financial markets more broadly. &nbsp;I also worked directly or participated in the development of consultations organized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and global international standard setting bodies seeking to better understand AI compliance and surveillance use cases.</span></p>
<p><span>Many industry trade associations are similarly engaged in better understanding the potential for AI use cases. The Institute of International Finance (IIF), for example, surveys its members annually about its uses of artificial intelligence and machine learning. In the most recent IIF survey report, published in January 2025, compliance (including anti-money laundering and trade surveillance) ranked in the top four predictive AI use cases for respondents.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Treasury&rsquo;s report on Artificial Intelligence in Financial Markets reports that &ldquo;AI is widely used for&hellip;AML/CFT and sanctions compliance, including analyzing large sets of data, detecting anomalies, flagging suspicious activities, and verifying customer identities under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Other publications contain similar observations about compliance use cases as AI adoption in financial services continues to develop.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a></p>
<p><span>A recent consultation report published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on AI in capital markets reports that IOSCO members and self-regulatory organizations&nbsp;(SROs) observed that market participants are:</span></p>
<p><span>using AI to enhance the effectiveness of AML and CFT measures, particularly, and compliance more generally, including to identify suspicious transactions. For AML compliance, customer onboarding, and due diligence, respondents observed that market participants use ML models to perform pattern recognition and anomaly detection in surveillance software. They also use NLP to enhance the interpretation of unstructured data and to facilitate name screening and news analysis.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a></p>
<p><span>The IOSCO Report also noted that other recent reports had consistent findings, and cited numerous industry reports about how large language models (LLMs) are used for compliance tasks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>AI and Trade Surveillance</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Indisputably, AI technologies demonstrate significant potential for enhancing trade surveillance. The recent IOSCO Report referenced earlier notes the incorporation of &ldquo;AI tools in surveillance and security solutions that could assist market participants to monitor client communications such as emails, calls, and mobile chat applications, and could raise alerts on suspicious communications for compliance review and investigation.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a></p>
<p><span>One of the reasons that the markets that the CFTC regulates are the deepest and most liquid in the world is that our regulatory framework includes measures designed to ensure the integrity of the markets, a necessary feature for markets that so many rely on to hedge and manage risk.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) sets forth core principles for designated contract markets (DCMs) that require DCMs to &ldquo;establish, monitor, and enforce&rdquo; compliance with a DCM&rsquo;s rules and to establish and enforce certain rules and procedures to ensure financial stability of transactions on the DCM.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The implementing rules for each of these core principles include requirements related to surveillance. Rule 38.156 requires a DCM to &ldquo;maintain an automated trade surveillance system capable of detecting and investigating potential trade practice violations&rdquo; and includes additional requirements for the system including certain capabilities, features and timing.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Rule 38.604 states that &ldquo;A designated contract market must monitor members' compliance with the designated contract market's minimum financial standards and, therefore, must routinely receive and promptly review financial and related information from its members, as well as continuously monitor the positions of members and their customers.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Similarly, Section 5h of the CEA establishes compliance with rules and financial integrity as core principles for swap execution facilities (SEFs),</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span>[15]</span></a><span>&nbsp;and implementing rules include requirements on SEFs to maintain an automated trade surveillance system pursuant to Rule 37.203 as part of their required rule enforcement program.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a></p>
<p><span>These are just a few examples, and perhaps one of the many reasons that it is not surprising to me that CFTC-regulated markets have always been among the most technology-forward, including with its use of AI.</span></p>
<p><span>I continuously advocate for a number of policy initiatives related to AI, and the first one is the most fundamental: collaboration. I hope to continue to be able to learn how we can work together to discover how AI can be leveraged to enhance registrants&rsquo; ability to comply with our existing requirements, and to support a stronger, safer, and more vital derivatives market, while also enhancing efficiencies for registrants.</span></p>
<p><span>A discussion of potential uses of AI in the derivatives markets requires also considering the broader financial market landscape. The IOSCO Report noted that respondents &ldquo;observed efforts to enhance surveillance measures in the financial industry through the development of joint systems that can be used by multiple financial institutions to share data and intelligence to mitigate types of threats utilizing AI and other technologies.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span>[17]</span></a></p>
<p><span>I have advocated for a number of policy initiatives related to AI consistently throughout my time at the Commission, and one of those policies is inter-governmental collaboration with other financial market regulators in the U.S. and globally. If we do not work together, we risk missing out on significant opportunities not only to learn from each other and build on best practices, but also opportunities to create broader initiatives that make our markets safer and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A Pause to Look Under the Hood</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As we consider the possibilities, we also need to be mindful of the risks. As AI tools become further integrated into organizational processes, especially those that relate to critical compliance or surveillance functions, those organizations, as well as regulators, need to have appropriate assurances that the tools will operate safely and reliably.</span></p>
<p><span>It is imperative that we have a clear understanding of and appropriate guardrails to ensure the security and integrity of the data used to train AI models. Data governance must be a foundational, gatekeeping issue for the continued development of AI models, particularly LLMs that may rely on synthetic data. I have frequently raised concerns regarding these risks&mdash;including concerns regarding the potential for AI models to hallucinate or lack the ability to comprehend certain real-world roadblocks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span>[18]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Agentic AI models, while able to overcome some of the limitations of generative AI models, are still limited by the data they are able to access.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span>[19]</span></a><span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also spoken about some of the other questions that need to be accounted for as we consider the integration of AI into financial markets, such as promoting explainability, implementing data controls and measures to address bias, focusing on governance of the models, and testing and monitoring output.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><span>[20]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Market participants must understand the risks of data leakage which may include reduced accuracy, unfairness and bias, data privacy breaches, and other vulnerabilities.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson20#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span>[21]</span></a><span>&nbsp;I am hopeful that these are among the issues that participants at the Summit will explore today.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Where Are We Going Next?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Increasingly, I am asked this question on a frequent basis. In the context of AI, I believe there is significant potential for these technologies to enhance the tripartite approach to regulation&mdash;my earlier reference to three-dimensions or a three-legged stool of governance and compliance mentioned. Successful integration of AI will require careful consideration by firms and the industry as well as thoughtful regulatory oversight by domestic and international regulators. For a few hundred years, we have been on a journey to create a sound regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p><span>My personal journey in service is not nearly as long but I am deeply committed to ensuring that we land on the right path as we integrate and potentially regulate AI. In becoming a CFTC Commissioner, I have had the privilege and the pleasure of fulfilling a personal professional goal&mdash;serving my country in a role that I hope fosters a healthy economy that enables responsible innovation, protects customers, and ensures the integrity and stability of financial markets for generations to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for being on this journey with me. I look forward to continuing the conversation with you all today and in the coming years.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" lang="fr">Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers</span>&nbsp;(<span>AMF</span>) advises the public that, on April&nbsp;23, 2025, it obtained permanent injunctions from the Superior Court of Qu&eacute;bec (<span>Superior Court</span>) compelling Canada&rsquo;s main telecommunications companies to block access to the websites of the cryptoasset trading platforms XT.com and CoinEx (Court File Nos.&nbsp;500-11-064818-244 and 500-11-064819-242).</p>
<p>XT.com and CoinEx, which are not registered with the AMF and not linked to each other, had already been the subject of decisions by the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal, dated respectively&nbsp;<a href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/general-public/media-centre/news/fiche-dactualites/xtcom-amf-marks-major-milestone-in-offensive-to-enforce-crypto-trading-platform-compliance">September&nbsp;20, 2023</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/general-public/media-centre/news/fiche-dactualites/coinex-amf-continues-its-offensive-to-enforce-crypto-asset-trading-platform-compliance">November&nbsp;14, 2023</a>. The decisions ordered them to block access to their websites and inform platform users that they would cease to be accessible and that they should therefore withdraw all their assets and close their accounts as soon as possible. However, XT.com and CoinEx did not comply with these orders.</p>
<p><span>The permanent injunctions issued by the Superior Court are final. As such, Canadian investors who still have assets on the XT.com and CoinEx platforms must access their accounts and withdraw their assets before access to the platforms is blocked.</span></p>
<p><span>Be advised that platform blocking will be implemented:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>between August&nbsp;6 and August&nbsp;20, 2025, for XT.com</span></li>
<li><span>between August&nbsp;12 and August&nbsp;26, 2025, for CoinEx</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Good morning. I would like to thank Risk.net for inviting me to speak today.</p>
<p>I will take this opportunity to talk about innovation in financial services. My focus will be on the role the PRA can play in fostering innovation&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk201056389"></a>in the UK banking and insurance sectors; and how doing so can support firms becoming more resilient as well as promoting competition, UK competitiveness and growth more broadly.</p>
<p>I will particularly focus on the impacts of our Secondary Competitiveness and Growth Objective (SCGO).<span>&nbsp;</span>This came into effect in August 2023 and has had a material impact on how we make policy, and on the policy outcomes we deliver.<span>&nbsp;</span>In advancing the SCGO, we are working closely with the government to support its focus on growth; the importance of which was emphasised to us through HMT&rsquo;s recommendations letter to the PRA, and an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2025/pra-letter-to-the-prime-minister">exchange of letters</a>&nbsp;between the Prime Minister and Sam Woods &ndash; our CEO &ndash; at Christmas.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To date, much of the external focus on the SCGO has been on how the PRA can, through greater efficiency and streamlining of regulation, reduce the regulatory burden for firms. We have been putting lots of energy into this, for instance by reducing the reporting requirements for insurers we inherited from the EU by around a third through the Solvency UK reforms that came into effect earlier this year. We are also working on major amendments to our remuneration requirements for banks that will enhance the sector's competitiveness while maintaining its resilience.<em>&nbsp;</em>That last point about maintaining resilience is key, as it supports financial stability which in turn underpins sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>But another important aspect is the role that regulation plays in fostering innovation. Like innovation in other sectors, for example the advent of smartphones, innovation in financial services can lead to radical changes in the world around us. Just look at the evolution of how we make payments through cash, online and contactless payments to the new forms of digital money that we are now seeing. But, as with smartphones, innovation in financial services can require significant upfront investment to pursue &ndash; and is not without risks.</p>
<p>At the PRA, we are committed to creating an environment where innovation can flourish safely and where households, business and markets can reap the benefits. In doing so, there is a careful balance to strike between writing rules to provide firms with the certainty they need to invest with confidence, whilst providing enough flexibility to create space for innovation to flourish. We are continuing to think carefully about this balance, and our stakeholders have an important role to play in helping us get it right.</p>
<p>I will therefore begin by providing some background on the SCGO, including the work we have done to embed it at the PRA, and how it is impacting policy outcomes. I will then turn to innovation, explaining where it sits within our approach to the SCGO, and outlining some of the ways in which it can support our objectives. I will then discuss some of the risks and costs involved and share some reflections on how our approach to regulation can mitigate those risks. Finally, I will touch on how you, and our broader set of stakeholders, can engage us on the topic of innovation, and the important role stakeholder input plays in shaping our approach.</p>
<h3>Background on the SCGO</h3>
<p>The SCGO mandates the PRA, so far as reasonably possible, to &ldquo;facilitate subject to aligning with relevant international standards &ndash; (a) the international competitiveness of the economy of the United Kingdom (including in particular, the financial services sector through the contribution of PRA authorised persons), and (b) its growth in the medium to long term&rdquo;.&nbsp;As with the Secondary Competition Objective which we have had since 2014, it is engaged when the PRA exercises its general functions, such as making rules and technical standards, or determining the general policy and principles governing our functions. Therefore, it is engaged when we set our approach to supervision but does not directly apply to firm specific supervisory decisions. Our secondary objectives are also engaged only when we discharge our general functions in a way that also pursues at least one of our two primary objectives: the safety and soundness of firms we regulate, and on the insurance side, policy holder protection. It is also important to note that there is a complementary relationship, rather than a trade-off, between our primary and secondary objectives. Building on what I said earlier, sustainable economic growth over the medium to long term requires a resilient financial sector to support it.</p>
<p>We have embedded the SCGO at the heart of our policymaking processes, which has led to a step change in how we make policy. We have set out our strategy for advancing the SCGO, which is detailed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2025/february/pra-approach-to-policy-policy-statement">Policy Approach</a>&nbsp;we published earlier this year and our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/july/pra-secondary-competitiveness-and-growth-objectives-report-2023-24">Annual Report</a>. This included establishing a centre of expertise for the SCGO within the PRA which has delivered training across staff in policy, supervision, and authorisations to promote best practice. And our policy papers set out clearly how any proposed initiatives would impact on competitiveness and growth, with our governance committees, such as the Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), regularly reviewing progress.</p>
<p>To provide an independent assessment of how we are doing, last year The Bank&rsquo;s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) assessed our progress in embedding the SCGO. The IEO&rsquo;s report noted good progress and &lsquo;numerous positives&rsquo; including the investment the PRA has made on its approach to the SCGO and the traction gained across all levels of the PRA. It also made recommendations, such as building on existing networks to ensure that intelligence from inside and outside the Bank informs policymaking, which we have made good progress in addressing.</p>
<p>Our enhanced consideration of competitiveness and growth have also had a material impact on the policy we have delivered. These included actions we have taken such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basel 3.1, where we are implementing international standards to make our bank capital requirements more reflective of risks taken by firms. In doing so we tailored our final rules to reflect UK specific circumstances, for instance to lower capital requirements vs the international standards in order to support lending to SMEs and infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Solvency UK, where we simplified complex requirements inherited from the EU, and reformed Matching Adjustment rules, allowing life insurers to invest more in UK productive investments.</li>
<li>Removing the bonus cap, which had distortionary effects such as inflating bankers&rsquo; base salaries. Its removal is already boosting the UK&rsquo;s competitiveness internationally.</li>
<li><a id="_Hlk200436584"></a>Setting up, jointly with the FCA, a New Insurer Start-up Unit, sitting alongside our existing New Bank Start-up Unit, to provide information and support for those thinking of setting up a new insurer in the UK. This reduces barriers to entry, therefore facilitating effective competition and innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there is much more in the pipeline, including our plans for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalising our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2025/april/matching-adjustment-investment-accelerator-consultation-paper">proposals</a>&nbsp;for a &lsquo;Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator&rsquo; which will make it easier for insurers to take advantage of UK productive investment opportunities more quickly.</li>
<li><a id="_Hlk198742380"></a>Finalising rules to improve the UK framework for Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles, including simplifying and accelerating the authorisation process. And we are pleased to be supporting the Government as it finalises its views on captive insurance and stand ready to play our role.</li>
<li>Consulting on streamlining bank data reporting by eliminating little-used data collections, reducing the burden on firms while maintaining effective supervision and policymaking. This would build on the material reductions already implemented for insurers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on as there is much more in our pipeline, but there is no need because we will outline much more detail in our second annual report on how we are advancing our secondary objectives, which will be published next month. Instead, I want to focus on innovation specifically.</p>
<h3>So, what about innovation?</h3>
<p>These reforms will bring real benefits. But I said I would focus on innovation. In our Policy Approach document, which we published in February, we described three regulatory &lsquo;foundations&rsquo; which represent the ways our regulation underpins the UK&rsquo;s growth and competitiveness. These are: (i) maintaining trust among firms in the PRA and UK prudential framework; (ii) adopting effective regulatory processes and engagement; (iii) adopting a responsive and responsibly open approach to risks and opportunities. Innovation plays into all three of these and supporting it is consistent with advancing both our primary and secondary objectives.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk201058165"></a>Innovation can:</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="_Hlk198742254"></a>Enable new or more tailored products and services; allowing firms to do new things or find different ways to use existing products. More effective financial products and markets can support the financing and risk transfer needs of households and businesses as well as strengthen firms&rsquo; competitiveness and profitability, and through that their safety and soundness. We see this, for instance, with usage-based insurance &ndash; where observed behaviour (e.g. bad driving) is reflected in the insurance premium, thereby ensuring that pricing is better tailored to actual risk, at the same time as providing an incentive to reduce riskier behaviours.</li>
<li>Enable firms to do existing things better and more efficiently. This reduces costs for end users, freeing up their resources to invest in the growth of their business. It can also help financial firms to operate more profitably and compete more effectively, both domestically and internationally. We see this in the increasing usage of AI to reduce manual processes within firms, in how Machine Learning is starting to help inform insurance pricing, and through evolutions in payments technology.</li>
<li>Facilitate the broader provision of goods and services to sectors of the market that might otherwise be underserved. For example, by reducing the cost of non-standard products, such as those tailored for SMEs; or through innovations like peer-to-peer lending, which have increased access to credit. Through channels such as improved access to credit, this can support investment in the wider economy, in turn supporting growth over the medium to long term.</li>
<li><a id="_Hlk201058093"></a>Help making the financial system stronger and more resilient. For example, via the use of third-party services, including cloud-based ones, to replace inefficient legacy in-house systems and processes with more resilient and flexible ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>This underlines that if we support innovation in the right way, it will help strengthen our financial system, whilst also making it more diverse, efficient and competitive.</p>
<h3>Innovation is neither cost nor risk-free</h3>
<p>This shows there are many reasons for us to support innovation. But, and there is inevitably a &lsquo;but&rsquo;, innovation comes with costs and risks both to individual firms and the system. It often requires significant upfront investment, often with uncertain outcomes, as well as long-term planning. This means that the upfront and transition costs can be high. For example, the financial sector's spending on AI is projected to grow from $38 billion worldwide in 2024 to $190.3 billion in 2030.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/june/david-bailey-speech-at-risk-net-live-europe#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;This has been assessed to have the potential to cut operating costs in the financial industry by 22% - representing a total of $1 trillion in overall savings by 2030.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/june/david-bailey-speech-at-risk-net-live-europe#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are also risks that the PRA needs to consider. These risks can be financial, arising through new or more complex risk profiles of innovative products. They can be operational, for example as firms transition to new technologies or embed dependencies on new third parties. Or they can be conduct-related as financial services are delivered to new sets of consumers or through different ways.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for the PRA&rsquo;s approach to regulation?</h3>
<p>This means that we need to take a thoughtful approach to our regulatory framework, if we are to support innovation by giving firms sufficient certainty and confidence to invest in new technologies and approaches in a way that ensures that risks are appropriately managed. And there is a spectrum of ways in which we could do that through our prudential rulemaking.</p>
<p>On one end of that spectrum, we could set out detailed rules at an early stage to provide certainty to firms on our expectations and to ensure that innovations are well understood, trialled and tested. An example of this approach from another sector might be medicines where, for very clear and good reasons, new products placed on the UK market require rigorous testing, product assurance and pre-approval from the regulator before going to market. The benefit of this approach is that it gives firms certainty on the approval process, and the standards to go to market. But it also requires a potentially significant investment from firms, both from a cost and time perspective, to get products to market.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of that spectrum, we could allow innovation to flourish freely, guided by limited regulation consisting of, for example, very high-level principles or guidelines. The benefit of this approach is that it creates ample space for innovation, whilst allowing regulators to be more flexible and responsive. However, it also creates more opportunities for risks to escalate and crystallise at speed, potentially forcing regulators to step-in quickly. For example, we have seen the potential harms of social media &ndash; an innovation which has significantly changed the way we interact and communicate &ndash; crystalise and prompt a retrospective response from governments internationally.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk198742657"></a>Between these two examples, there are a range of points we could land on this spectrum. Where we strike the balance is a genuine choice: one which might be guided by the innovation at hand &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same approach every time. But in general, my view is that the PRA&rsquo;s approach to prudential&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk198742700"></a>regulation has traditionally aimed to be more toward the second end than the first &ndash; although I recognise that not all of our stakeholders may agree with that assessment based on their own experience.</p>
<p>Take AI as an example of my point. Our approach has, to date, been open, flexible, technology agnostic and informed by extensive engagement with industry and other stakeholders. We have existing rules and standards in areas like model risk management and third-party outsourcing. These are established areas of policy and, informed by all our external engagement, we think they can apply to AI in the same way as they do to other technologies and processes. In line with that we have not, so far, concluded we need to develop detailed rules on the usage of AI as the technology &ndash; and its use by banks and insurers &ndash; evolves. We keep a careful eye on it, but we also don&rsquo;t want to unnecessarily get in the way of the benefits it may bring.</p>
<p>However, there are also examples where it might be more appropriate to start more towards the restrictive end of the spectrum, while evidence is gathered to see if standards can be relaxed over time. The prudential treatment of banks&rsquo; exposures to cryptoassets, and specifically those with features associated with heightened price volatility and where investors could lose the entirety of their investment, is an example in this space. Here, of course, we are being informed by the standards that have been developed internationally, in this case by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which we remain committed to implementing in the UK. In this area, we plan to bring forward our proposals in 2026.</p>
<p>I think this demonstrates it&rsquo;s a genuine choice we have available to us every time we look at a new innovation. But our general approach seeks to be alert and responsive to innovation. We have various tools at our disposal to help us, for example our horizon scanning work. Part of our work programme focuses on the emerging trends that might ultimately prompt a regulatory response; and this supports regular discussions at senior committees, such as the PRC and the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), who consider whether the risks are well understood, and whether our response is appropriate. Areas of particular focus are then outlined via our Supervisory Priorities letters, our PRA Business plans and our Financial Stability Reports.</p>
<p>We also use regular industry engagement to understand the demand to innovate, for example through regular roundtables and conferences, as well as ad-hoc meetings and supervisory engagement. Through these, we seek to understand where firms are looking to evolve how they operate, or the services they provide, so we can consider how our regulation can support those efforts develop in a resilient way. And to inform our overall approach to innovation we arranged a bespoke roundtable for industry participants. A key point emphasised at this was the benefits of a collaborative approach, involving ongoing engagement with industry on specific topics. We have increased our focus here by hosting more roundtables and Subject Expert Groups on specific themes or issues. This is supplemented by specific groups like the recently launched AI Consortium which we chair jointly with the FCA and has been established by our colleagues in the Bank&rsquo;s FinTech Hub to act a platform for public-private engagement to gather input on the capabilities, development and use of AI in UK financial services.</p>
<p>Informed by that engagement we then decide what an appropriate regulatory response should be. To give a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator I mentioned earlier, where we wanted &ndash; in a measured and responsible way &ndash; to facilitate firms to get capital benefit earlier by adding assets to their Matching Adjustment portfolio, thereby reducing barriers to rapid investment in projects which support growth in the UK.</li>
<li><a id="_Hlk198741748"></a>The Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), a regulated live environment that&nbsp;has been created by my Bank of England colleagues, in partnership with the FCA, to explore how&nbsp;developing technologies&nbsp;could be used by firms in a controlled way to undertake the activities of&nbsp;notary, maintenance and settlement for financial securities. Good progress has been made here with strong applications received. The format of the DSS has allowed us to switch off rules and look at a mix of activities that would otherwise not be possible to be performed by a single legal entity.</li>
<li>Critical Third Parties &ndash; such as Cloud Service Providers &ndash; where the reliance on a small set of providers, by the firms we regulate, had grown to the extent we felt it necessary to step in with formal regulation to mitigate risks to financial stability.</li>
<li>Stablecoins and tokenised deposits&nbsp;&ndash; we have worked closely with the Bank&rsquo;s Financial Markets Infrastructure Directorate to evaluate the risks and opportunities of new forms of digital money. In doing so we have considered the related implications and incentives created by the various regulatory frameworks involved. Our goal is to ensure that similar products with similar protections face comparable regulation. This would ensure that deposit-taking entities, who we have previously said should only provide innovations in the form of deposits (for example in tokenised form), can compete openly with non-banks issuing systemic stablecoins under the Bank&rsquo;s new regulatory regime. This supports innovation, enabling both incumbent and new firms to compete while ensuring that customers are able to use different forms of digital money with confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, I think this flexible type of approach has served us well given the types of challenges we have faced. But are keeping our approach under review, to ensure that we strike a sensible balance as the world evolves around us. Our stakeholders play an important role in helping us strike that balance, so I welcome thoughts and feedback on how we might adjust our approach as we go forward.</p>
<h3>Innovation within the PRA</h3>
<p>Before I conclude, I wanted to say a word on our use of innovation within the PRA. We are very conscious that technological developments and innovations can have a transformative effective on what we do &ndash; allowing us to be faster, better, more efficient and more targeted in aspects of our regulation and supervision.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk201058185"></a>As one example, my colleague James Benford, the Bank&rsquo;s Chief Data Officer gave a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/september/james-benford-speech-at-the-central-bank-ai-inaugural-conference">speech</a>&nbsp;last year setting out our approach to leveraging AI in a safe, ethical and effective way to support our work delivering monetary and financial stability. Within the PRA this includes using Natural Language Processing to study the content of our regulation and help enhance how we draft our rules and communicate about them; leveraging AI to gain supervisory insights from large quantities of unstructured data &ndash; a task that was previously high intensity and manual; and using generative AI to summarise meetings and documents. But before anyone gets concerned about being regulated by technology alone, our approach embeds the critical importance of there always being a human in the loop&nbsp;in our use of AI.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, advancing the SCGO and supporting growth within the financial sector, is complemented and underpinned by our focus on safety and soundness and a resilient financial sector. It requires a thoughtful and effective regulatory approach. Through this we will continue to deliver changes that lessen the regulatory burden on firms by making regulation more efficient and proportionate. But it is also important we also focus on how we can support the firms we regulate to innovate to do better things, and to do things better. We will seek to do so in a flexible and responsive way; relying on close engagement with industry to inform the balance we strike.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today is National Eat Your Vegetables Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, you haven&rsquo;t walked into a speech today from the Food Standards Agency. This is the FCA, not the FSA. But if you&rsquo;ve been following FCA speeches over the past couple of years, we have a bit of a thing for food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, we were encouraging you to eat the frog &ndash; tackling tricky issues head on with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we were asking about your appetite for tech and innovation &ndash; full-fat, semi-skimmed, or somewhere in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;ve rounded out the plate with our new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-strategy-2025-2030" title="Our strategy 2025 to 2030">5-year strategy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The 3 Ps</h2>
<p>The invite for this conference picked out that, under the new strategy, we will be a proportionate regulator.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that what&rsquo;s right for a 50,000-person firm is not always the same for a smaller business, which is why we worked with a broad range of stakeholders to get this strategy right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if the drafter left out the beautiful alliteration of predictable and purposeful deliberately, but there&rsquo;s a reason we included these other words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to run your businesses well, you need to know what we are going to do and why &ndash; predictable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when we do act, we&rsquo;ll do so decisively, reflecting all our objectives and in a relentless drive to deliver on the vision set out in our strategy &ndash; purposeful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We achieved a great deal under our previous, and first, multi-year strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our 2022 strategy had 13 super-charged priorities. &nbsp;Was this too many?&nbsp;To reflect a more focused, streamlined regulator, the new strategy has 4 themes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The clear areas where we and the industry need to succeed.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-growth" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>It was front of our minds when developing the strategy, and it came through loud and clear in the extensive engagement we did. Growth has always been part of our story as a regulator.&nbsp; Recently, we&rsquo;ve delivered once-in-a-generation listing rule changes to launching long-term asset funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we are going further, and faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Prime Minister&rsquo;s letter on Christmas Eve, we&rsquo;ve identified, and started working on, more than 50 ideas to support the Government&rsquo;s growth mission in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are simplifying rules: relying, for example, on the Consumer Duty to provide protection for consumers.</p>
<p>Stripping outdated requirements from our insurance rule book and simplifying the responsible lending advice rules for mortgages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just last week we opened the application process for firms who want to operate our new, innovative platform for trading shares,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/pisces-private-intermittent-securities-capital-exchange-system" title="PISCES: platforms for trading private company shares">Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System &ndash; PISCES</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bold reforms come with risk, and we&rsquo;ve been up-front and open about where we are introducing risk into the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We accept that firms fail, investors lose money. But rebalancing risk is necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reward and risk work in tandem. It will unlock investment and growth. We&rsquo;re a nation losing out because of a risk not taken, an investment not made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have heard our chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, talking about the importance of our international work during his session with the Treasury Select Committee last week. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s central to his second term and will be a focus for the organisation throughout the next 5 years as we lean in with our international partners. This should be of no surprise to you though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You were the original financial services exporters. We have continued to lead the world for insurance ever since Edward Lloyd&rsquo;s coffee house.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the biggest global commercial and speciality risk market. Last year, Lloyds had one of its most profitable years in recent history. We want to maintain that position as a truly global financial hub. It benefits the whole country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have always worked through international forums, and we will continue to advocate for global standards where they are needed. The world is changing, and our bilateral relationships help us deliver our priorities. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-being-a-smarter-regulator" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Being a smarter regulator</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also put how we operate as a regulator with equal footing, in our strategy. We know that how we work, how we serve you as clients, matters. And we&rsquo;ve shown we can deliver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complaints about our authorisations and the time taken to process applications used to fill my inbox. Particularly from this sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I barely hear a peep, and I&rsquo;d like to think this isn&rsquo;t just because I'm no longer &nbsp;<br />executive director for authorisations. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our last metrics showed 99.1% of applications were delivered within statutory deadlines.&nbsp;An efficient and effective authorisations service which maintains high standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more we can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will support growth by making it easier for new firms to start up and grow. We&rsquo;re continuing to digitise applications.&nbsp;We are growing our early and high growth oversight area, an initiative that came out of the Kalifa review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You told us that data collections weigh heavily on your minds. &nbsp;The impact of ad-hoc, complex and seemingly unnecessary data requests. So, we are actively reviewing and stopping data collections that we don&rsquo;t need any more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first wave, we are switching off 3 regulatory returns, benefiting 16,000 firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve found 3 more we&rsquo;d like to stop. These include the reporting of general insurance pricing attestations and renewal and insurance assessments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently launched My FCA, which makes it easier for firms to see their regulatory reporting, attestation tasks and their status, all in one place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working efficiently, reducing burden, making it easier for those who run firms to get on and do that.</p>

<h2>Helping consumers navigate their financial lives</h2>
<p>Decisions faced by consumers can feel complex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not going to hammer home the whys of demographic change, the overall economic environment or the complexity of the financial landscape &hellip;&nbsp; and how these have made decisions about personal finances increasingly difficult in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 7 million people are struggling to pay their debts, and many would struggle to deal with a financial shock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to work with government, industry, consumer groups and other partners to help people get the right help and right support they need, when they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through innovative ideas, like targeted support for those who are able to invest but cannot afford financial advice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Through partnerships with other bodies who are working to address low financial capability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through increasing trust in financial services products, so that people have the confidence to make the right choices for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early concerns about the outcomes-focused Consumer Duty have been replaced. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Understanding that by making the Duty fit for your firm, it supports consumers and growth. It&rsquo;s the foundation of this theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help protect people from financial shocks and provide properly for their overall financial health, we need growing, well-functioning markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an either/or choice.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-fighting-crime" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Fighting crime</h2>
<p>Well-functioning, trusted markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminals are becoming more sophisticated and orchestrated within financial services. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />That&rsquo;s why fighting financial crime was a key pillar of our last strategy and remains so today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-border, cross-sector crime detection needs increased data sharing across partners, focused cooperation between us and the industry. We must always stay one step ahead of the criminals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with more partners, using technology to better identify scams and abnormal trading, and concluding our enforcement investigations faster.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unlike broccoli, we haven&rsquo;t been forced into this strategy by parental bribery or guilt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve balanced it &ndash; carefully and deliberately &ndash; as our regimen for a changing financial world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A plan rooted in purpose, focused on outcomes, and designed to use our powers wisely &ndash; for smarter risk taking, stronger trust and better outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m immensely proud of our strategy, the way it was constructed across industry, trade bodies, consumer groups, parliament and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while I am leaving the FCA, I am not leaving financial services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can speak with certainty that the FCA &ndash; the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog &ndash; is in the best health to become the critical friend, enforcer of standards and guide that financial services needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust and risk: a balanced partnership.</p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Technical Standards On Acquisitions In Credit Institutions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS)</span>&nbsp;<span>specifying the list of minimum information to be provided to the relevant competent authority at the time of the notification of the proposed acquisition of qualifying holdings in a credit institution. These RTS aim at harmonising the minimum content of the notification to the competent authority of the target credit institution with a view to supporting a harmonised prudential assessment of the proposed acquisition against the five assessment criteria set out in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). The consultation runs until 18 September 2025.</span></p>
<p>The draft RTS require information on the proposed acquirer&rsquo;s identity, reputation and financial soundness. To support the assessment of the sound and prudent management of the target credit institution, the proposed acquirer is requested to submit a business plan, with more specific information in case of control acquisition. Information on the legitimate origin of the sources of funding is requested, among others, to assess suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing risk.</p>
<p>To reflect proportionality concerns and to support efficient supervisory practices, these RTS envisage exemptions from the submission of information already in possession of the competent authority. Reduced information is also requested in specific acquisition structures where the indirect proposed acquirer is expected to exercise negligible influence (if any) on the target credit institution.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Responses to the consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-minimum-list-information-proposed-acquisition-qualifying-holdings">public hearing</a>&nbsp;will take place via conference call on&nbsp;Tuesday 15 July from 14:00-16:00 CET. The deadline for registration is 11 July at 16:00 CET.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published after the consultation closes, unless requested otherwise. The deadline for the submission of comments is 18 September 2025.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>Article 23(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/1619 (CRDVI), mandates the EBA to develop RTS to set out the list of minimum information to be included in the notification submitted by the proposed acquirer of qualifying holdings to the competent authority of the target credit institution prior to the proposed acquisition.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Leaves The Countercyclical Buffer Rate Unchanged</title>

<p><span>In accordance with its assessment in the most recent stability report, FI is leaving the countercyclical buffer rate unchanged in the second quarter. The buffer rate of 2 per cent, which was applied starting on 22 June 2023, shall thus continue to apply. The countercyclical buffer guide is calculated at 0 per cent.</span></p>

<title>Securities Trading: EU Council And Parliament Agree On Shorter Settlement Cycle</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-trading-eu-council-and-parliament-agree-on-shorter-settlement-cycle-2025618/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-trading-eu-council-and-parliament-agree-on-shorter-settlement-cycle-2025618/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="gsc-main-section    ">
<div class="gsc-container gsc-bge-grid">
<div class="gsc-bge-grid__area">
<p>The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement today on new rules to make transactions in transferable securities more efficient.</p>
<p>The goal is to&nbsp;<strong>shorten the settlement cycle on securities trades</strong>, such as transactions in shares or bonds, executed on EU trading venues, from no later than two business days (the so-called &lsquo;T+2&rsquo;)&nbsp;<strong>to no later than one business day after the trade date (&lsquo;T+1&rsquo;)</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="gsc-blockquote gsc-blockquote--image"><figure class="gsc-blockquote__img"><img alt="&lt;p&gt;Andrzej Domanski, Polish minister for finance&lt;/p&gt;" src="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ntklfcol/andrzej-doma%C5%84ski-minister-of-finance.png" /></figure>
<div><span class="gsc-blockquote__quote"><svg class="gsc-icon gsc-icon--quotes" height="38" width="38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><use xlink:href="/assets/icons/sprite.svg#quotes" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></use></svg>
<p>A win for the Polish Presidency &mdash; we led the push to shorten the settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1, meaning trades in shares or bonds will now be settled in one day instead of two. Faster settlements mean stronger markets and a more competitive EU.</p>
</span><cite><span class="gsc-blockquote__dash">&nbsp;</span>
<p>Andrzej Domanski, Polish minister for finance</p>
</cite></div>
</blockquote>
<p>The new measure takes the form of&nbsp;<strong>an amendment to the central securities depositories regulation (CSDR)</strong>, which entered into force ten years ago. The regulation harmonised the securities settlement cycle in the EU at a maximum of two business days after the trade date. Since then, many markets outside the EU have shortened their settlement cycle or are in the process of doing so.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s agreement to change the settlement cycle in the CSDR will therefore&nbsp;<strong>prevent a misalignment between EU and global financial markets</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>maintain the competitiveness of EU capital markets</strong>. Indeed, both the Draghi and Letta reports highlight the current post-trading landscape, including settlement of trades, as a significant barrier to EU capital markets.</p>
<h2>Exemption for certain products</h2>
<p>The co-legislators agreed however to&nbsp;<strong>exempt certain securities financing transactions (SFTs)</strong>&nbsp;from the settlement cycle requirement. SFTs are financial transactions that allow investors and firms to use assets, such as the shares or bonds they own, to secure funding for their activities.</p>
<p>In order to avoid any risks of circumvention of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, the exemption should only apply if SFTs are documented as single transactions composed of two linked operations.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The two institutions will have to formally adopt the new rules. They will then apply from 11 October 2027.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Commission proposed the initiative to shorten the settlement cycle on 12 February 2025.</p>

<title>Swedish And Lithuanian Energy Regulators Request More Time To Agree On Electricity Cross-Zonal Risk Hedging Opportunities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 9 May 2025, the Swedish and Lithuanian national regulatory authorities (Energy Markets Inspectorate and National Energy Regulatory Council, respectively) requested from ACER a six-month extension to jointly decide on electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities?</span></p>
<p>Cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities are strategies used by electricity market participants to mitigate price volatility risks across different bidding zones. They are important to ensure the proper functioning of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale electricity markets and protecting market participants from price uncertainty.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why an ACER Decision?</span></p>
<p>In accordance with the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSCFQJBVJdB0wMU1JVHVYKA1IdCggGVxoBBgZTUgIFBVMGAFMdB1FVAFxUAAIdAw8FBR0GDFJTGg0AAFUZB1AGAgZVCFAFXVRVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Forward Capacity Allocation</a>&nbsp;network code, the Swedish and Lithuanian national regulators tasked transmission system operators to propose alternative measures to improve cross-zonal hedging opportunities in the Lithuanian bidding zone.</p>
<p>The Swedish and Lithuanian transmission system operators submitted a joint proposal to their national regulators, but it contained some ambiguities.</p>
<p>Therefore, both regulators requested ACER additional time to assess the system operators&rsquo; proposal.

<title>SEC Announces Departure Of David Saltiel</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-david-saltiel-2025618/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-announces-departure-of-david-saltiel-2025618/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that David Saltiel, who has served as Acting Director of the Division of Trading and Markets, will depart the agency effective July 4, 2025. He has served as Acting Director since December 2024, and he also did so for several months in 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank David for his wise counsel since I became Chairman, and he has been a critical member of the Division&rsquo;s leadership team for nearly a decade,&rdquo; said Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;Throughout his career at the SEC, David&rsquo;s steady leadership has clearly demonstrated his commitment to the core mission of the agency, the highest ethical standards, a dedication to rigorous data-driven policymaking, and a strategic mindset. David&rsquo;s contributions have made our markets stronger. The SEC will lose an outstanding resource; nevertheless, I wish him the very best in his next pursuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David&rsquo;s reputation as a technical expert who cares deeply about investor protection and fair and orderly markets has been well-earned,&rdquo; said Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. &ldquo;David has consistently been a source of well-researched, principled, and balanced insights for Commissioners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Saltiel has made critical contributions to a wide range of policy issues including equity, fixed-income, Treasury, and derivatives market structure topics, key transparency and disclosure initiatives such as the recent amendments to Rule 605, efforts to ensure that investors are protected from market manipulation, fostering competition among trading and listing markets, and the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence by market participants. In addition, Mr. Saltiel has significantly enhanced the Commission&rsquo;s ability to monitor the health and operations of markets, improved key data and analysis platforms, and worked tirelessly to more closely integrate empirical analysis into the Commission&rsquo;s policymaking process. During his tenure, Mr. Saltiel was consistently recognized for his work, including with the Commission&rsquo;s Excellence in Leadership Award in 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David&rsquo;s departure is a loss for the Commission, but he leaves the Division a legacy of culture and capabilities that will benefit our team for years to come. We are grateful and wish him all the best,&rdquo; said Jamie Selway, the newly appointed Director of the Division of Trading and Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Chairman Atkins, all the Commissioners, and my colleagues in the Division as well as across the SEC,&rdquo; said Mr. Saltiel. "The staff in the Division are smart and dedicated people of integrity. It&rsquo;s been an honor to work with them and learn from them. I will miss the interesting and critical work of the Commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to his time serving as the Acting Director of the Division of Trading and Markets in 2025 and 2021, Mr. Saltiel served as a Deputy Director of the Division since November 2021 and Associate Director of the Division&rsquo;s Office of Analytics and Research since 2016. Mr. Saltiel came to the SEC from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board where he was that organization&rsquo;s first Chief Economist. Prior to that, Mr. Saltiel has held roles in the public and private sector facilitating growth and innovation in capital markets and energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>He received his undergraduate degree from Williams College and earned his master&rsquo;s degree in economics from St. Antony&rsquo;s College at the University of Oxford.</p>

<title>FIA Tech Launches New Data Service For IRS 871(M) For Exchange Traded Derivatives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FIA Tech, a leading technology provider in the futures industry, announced that it has launched a new data service to meet the demands of customers trading futures and options for an accurate, comprehensive data solution designed to assist firms in complying with the tax regulation 871(m).</p>
<p>In September 2015, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;) and the U.S. Treasury Department released final regulations under Section 871(m) of the Internal Revenue Code which established regulations regarding the withholding of &ldquo;dividend equivalent payments&rdquo; on derivatives that reference U.S. equity securities. For market participants trading in these derivative products, failure to accurately determine products subject to this withholding status as required by the 871(m) regulations may lead to fines, increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities, and costly measures to rectify operational workflows.</p>
<p>By leveraging the vast amounts of exchange traded derivative (ETD) product and underlying reference data within FIA Tech&rsquo;s Databank Network, 871(m) highlights key attributes of global index derivatives which are utilized to determine if a product is classified as &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-qualified&rdquo; per IRS regulations.</p>
<p>Andrew Castello, SVP, Head of Client Operations,&nbsp;FIA Tech, said: &ldquo;Our 871(m) solution is a powerful addition to our end-to-end regulatory support for ETD clients&mdash;streamlining compliance in a complex landscape. Delivered in a standardized, consolidated format, it seamlessly integrates with our rich reference data and can be customized with vendor symbologies or other reference data inputs to meet each client&rsquo;s unique needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FIA Tech&rsquo;s Databank offering also includes Corporate Actions, a globally aggregated database which continuously tracks corporate actions announced on equity derivative exchange; Cash &amp; Collateral, a globally collated dataset of acceptable collateral sourced from directly from our CCP, partners and its recently launched Foreign Securities Futures and Sanctioned Securities offerings.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that its central securities depository subsidiary, The Depository Trust Company (DTC), has surpassed a record-setting $100 trillion in assets under custody as overall U.S. market capitalization continues to rise.</p>
<p>When reviewing assets under custody, DTC saw growth across many asset classes from 2020 to 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equities grew to $74.1 Trillion from $49.6 Trillion (+49%)</li>
<li>Within those equities, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) doubled, to $11 Trillion from $5.5 Trillion (+100%)</li>
<li>Money Market Instruments grew to $4.1 Trillion from $3.2 Trillion (+28%)</li>
</ul>
<p>In total, DTC assets under custody increased to $100.3 Trillion (2025) from $73.5 Trillion (2020), representing growth of 37%.</p>
<p>DTC is the central securities depository for equities, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds in the U.S. capital markets, and is a critical link in the post-trade lifecycle. DTC holds securities on behalf of financial institutions, custodian banks and brokers, and provides safekeeping and asset servicing, underwriting, corporate actions processing, securities processing, global tax services and issuer services. DTC reduces market risk by ensuring the safekeeping of securities and facilitating timely and accurate settlement.</p>
<p>Today, DTC provides custody and asset servicing for over 1.44 million securities issues from over 170 countries and territories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the financial services industry continues to grow, firms around the world continue to turn to DTC for the asset servicing of securities issued in the U.S.,&rdquo; said Frank La Salla, DTCC President and CEO. &ldquo;This milestone is more than a measure of scale; it&rsquo;s testament to the trust the financial industry places in DTCC and our responsibility to soundness and safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past 50 years, DTCC has served as a galvanizing force, delivering automation and innovative capabilities that have secured and advanced financial markets for decades. From our work as the central clearing provider in the U.S. for equities and treasury transactions, to leading critical industry efforts such as T+1 and U.S. Treasury clearing, to facilitating the expansion of the digital asset ecosystem, DTCC remains committed to shaping the future of financial markets infrastructure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DTCC has played a critical role in the financial markets for decades, enabling it to scale and grow while ensuring resiliency and safety,&rdquo; added Brian Steele, Managing Director and President, DTCC Clearing &amp; Securities Services. &ldquo;We are proud of our partnership with firms across the industry as they continue to place their traditional securities at DTC. The structural changes introduced through the creation of DTC resulted in our modern-day market structure that helped establish the U.S. equities market as one of the deepest, most liquid markets in the world. As we look to the future, we will be pioneering new digital asset solutions that we believe will be the next evolution of market structure, including DTC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Established in 1973, DTC was created to reduce costs and provide clearing and settlement efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making "book-entry" changes to ownership of the securities. Through its suite of securities processing services, DTC provides participant firms a range of safekeeping and processing services for various types of securities. Securities processing services deliver efficient and cost-effective solutions for deposits, withdrawals, electronic direct registration and custody. DTC&rsquo;s corporate actions processing and settlement services significantly enhance market efficiency and reduce operational risk. By automating and centralizing the handling of events such as dividends, mergers and reorganizations, DTC ensures accurate, timely and transparent communication between issuers and investors. Its settlement services offer reliable and secure processing of securities transactions, helping financial institutions reduce costs and improve compliance across the trade lifecycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As markets evolve, our commitment to stability, transparency and forward-looking innovation has never been stronger,&rdquo; added La Salla. &ldquo;As the industry enters a new era of digital transformation and continued growth across traditional markets, DTCC remains committed to driving initiatives that unlock new value.&rdquo;</p>

This step enhances the accessibility and tradability of our Depository Receipts, providing our shareholders with greater flexibility while preserving our core values. The listing allows us to broaden our community of impact-driven investors: individuals and institutions who believe, as we do, that banking should be a force for good. The listing is therefore also about building a stronger foundation to finance the transition to a more sustainable and inclusive economy. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to our shareholders, customers, colleagues and partners for their support in making this achievement possible.&rdquo;</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NZX continues to receive a positive regulatory report card, with a review by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; finding it has met its obligations while pursuing further enhancements.</p>
<p>The annual NZX Market Operator Obligations Review, released today, assesses how well NZX is meeting the requirements for its market operator licence. The report found NZX met all its obligations during the review period from 1 January to 31 December 2024.</p>
<p>FMA Director of Markets, Investors, and Reporting, John Horner, said: &ldquo;NZX continues to deliver a critical service to New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report shows businesses and investors can be confident NZX continues to operate in accordance with its market operator licence and is meeting its obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In particular, the review found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governance arrangements continue to be appropriate and support NZX&rsquo;s ability to comply with its licensed market operator obligations.</li>
<li>NZX and NZ RegCo are operating well-developed frameworks and processes, and continually working to further enhance operational effectiveness and resilience.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Continued demonstration of NZ RegCo&rsquo;s operational independence, while maintaining an appropriate and effective working relationship with NZX.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Maturity and investment in technology and risk management resources, with further enhancement in the review period providing stronger capability, resilience and security.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Significant milestones reached in NZX projects designed to further grow NZX&rsquo;s markets, improve investment choices and drive liquidity on the markets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The report has made no adverse findings and two recommendations.</p>
<p>The first recommendation is to encourage NZX to continue its plans to explore and test the resiliency and dependencies of participants, including their business continuity plans, and reduce the risks posed by reliance on critical service providers within the ecosystem, where practicable and reasonable.</p>
<p>NZX has further enhanced the group&rsquo;s crisis management framework, and successfully completed another crisis simulation event. The FMA recommends NZX continues to assess system recovery arrangements to increase its understanding and test whether further refinements are required for more extreme but plausible events.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/assets/Reports/NZX-Obligations-Review-2025.pdf" title="This report provides information on the review of NZX undertaken for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2024 (referred to as the review period). ">Download NZX Obligation Review 2025 [PDF 583KB]</a></p>

<title>ICE Launches Average Prime Offer Rates (APOR) Index</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-launches-average-prime-offer-rates-apor-index-2025617/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-launches-average-prime-offer-rates-apor-index-2025617/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of the ICE Average Prime Offer Rates Index (ICE APOR), which is updated weekly on the&nbsp;<a href="https://indices.ice.com/publications" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Index Platform</a>&nbsp;and publicly available.</p>
<p>The ICE APOR Index represents the annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, fees and other terms on mortgages that are offered to consumers. ICE APOR uses the same data from ICE Mortgage Technology&rsquo;s loan origination system,&nbsp;<a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/products/encompass" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Encompass&reg;</a>, that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) uses as the foundation of the weekly APOR rates it calculates and publishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existing APOR published by CFPB is a foundational rate that impacts residential mortgage lending standards and qualifications for securitization,&rdquo; said Chris Edmonds, President of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services. &ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s deep experience leveraging transactional data and designing trusted benchmarks was critical in constructing ICE APOR, which is intended to provide additional and continued transparency for both lenders and participants in the mortgage-backed security market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For lenders, consumers, and secondary market participants, the APOR published by the CFPB is used to determine whether a loan meets certain regulatory requirements, which determination can also impact the terms of a mortgage and whether a loan qualifies for securitization by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>ICE has deep expertise administering and publishing important rates and indices that are used throughout global markets, and ICE&rsquo;s extensive global index offering includes over 7,000 fixed income, equity, currency, commodity and mortgage indices that are trusted by market participants around the world and backed by a 50-year track record.</p>

<title>EEX Launches Biogas Production Certificates Registry In France</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eex-launches-biogas-production-certificates-registry-in-france-2025617/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eex-launches-biogas-production-certificates-registry-in-france-2025617/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) successfully launched the operation of the new biogas production certificate (CPBs &ndash; Certificats de Production de Biogaz) registry in France on Monday, 16&nbsp;June. This initiative, mandated by the French Ministry in charge of Energy, aims to support the development of biomethane as a renewable energy source within the country.</p>
<p>The CPB scheme, established under the 2021 French Climate and Resilience Act, requires natural gas suppliers to offer their customers a minimum share of biomethane. This is achieved through an obligation to return CPBs to the French state, thereby promoting the integration of renewable gases into the national energy mix.</p>
<p>Aude Filippi, EEX Director Business Development Gas and Sustainability markets, comments:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are honoured to operate this registry alongside our operations for the French Ministry, and by this to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable energy system in France.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Natural gas suppliers have the option to obtain CPBs by producing biomethane themselves or by purchasing certificates from biomethane producers. Biomethane is considered an important renewable energy carrier because it serves as a substitute for natural gas, providing energy storage capabilities and supporting decarbonisation efforts.</p>
<p>For more information on the CPB registry and how to get access to it, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eex.com/en/markets/energy-certificates/french-biogas-production-certificates" target="_blank">https://www.eex.com/en/markets/energy-certificates/french-biogas-production-certificates</a>.</p>

<title>Montréal Exchange To Launch FTSE Canada Bank Credit Index Futures -  A First-Of-Its Kind Credit Derivatives Product That Allows Market Participants To Manage Specific Canadian Credit Risk</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/montral-exchange-to-launch-ftse-canada-bank-credit-index-futures-a-first-of-2025617/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="sizeable">The Montr&eacute;al Exchange (MX), Canada's derivatives exchange, today announced its intention to introduce the FTSE Canada Bank Credit Index Futures (CBC)*, a first-of-its kind credit derivatives product designed to meet the evolving needs of market participants, slated for a Q1 2026 launch.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Based on the&nbsp;<a class="blank" href="https://www.lseg.com/en/media-centre/press-releases/ftse-russell/2025/canada-bank-credit-spread-index-launch" rel="external" target="_blank">FTSE Canada Bank Credit Spread Index</a>, the contract isolates the credit spread component of a portfolio of Canadian Bank bonds. This provides transparent, flexible and direct exposure to Canadian bank sector credit risk, which gives participants another tool to manage credit exposure. This newly created, innovative index - designed to reflect the Canadian bank credit market - will serve as the Futures contract underlying and is now available to participants.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"Developed in collaboration with FTSE Russell and the Canadian Fixed Income Forum, our credit spread futures will complement our current yield curve futures, generating greater value for our clients," said Robert Tasca, Managing Director, Derivatives Products and Services, Montr&eacute;al Exchange. "This expansion offers Canadian and international firms the transparency of a capital-efficient listed product to better manage their credit exposure."</p>
<p class="sizeable">The CBC contract will be designed to complement existing fixed income instruments, like cash bonds, exchange-traded funds and total return swaps, while offering distinct benefits, such as:</p>
<ul class="sizeable">
<li>Targeted Credit Exposure: Gain direct exposure to the credit spread of Canadian banks through a futures contract built on a representative and liquid bond index.</li>
<li>Expanded Yield Curve Access: Add new liquid points to the Canadian-listed yield curve, enhancing curve construction and trading precision.</li>
<li>Efficient Hedging Tool: Manage spread risk, portfolio duration and liquidity needs with a standardized, exchange-traded solution.</li>
<li>Versatile Trading Strategies: Implement tactical credit views, replicate synthetic long/short credit positions, or execute relative value trades.</li>
</ul>
<p class="sizeable">"We're excited to be working with the Montr&eacute;al Exchange to offer Canadian credit spread futures to the market," said Marina Mets, Head of Americas, Fixed Income and Convertibles at FTSE Russell, an LSEG business. "We're committed to fostering evolution in the markets we serve, and our newly launched FTSE Canada Bank Credit Spread Index further promotes our position as a leader in fixed income and multi-asset index solutions."</p>
<p class="sizeable">"The CAD credit future was born from a working group of the Canadian Fixed Income Forum (CFIF), a Bank of Canada sponsored committee," said Karl Wildi, Managing Director and Vice-Chair, Global Markets, CIBC Capital Markets and CFIF member. "The idea was to create a liquid, standardized beta credit product for use in the Canadian market. The concept was to create a product that could repatriate credit hedging that had migrated to the U.S. market, facilitate easier access to Canadian credit exposure for international investors, and provide a liquid product for portfolio managers to manage core Canadian credit risk."</p>
<p class="sizeable">For more information on FTSE Canada Bank Credit Index Futures, please visit&nbsp;<a class="blank" href="http://m-x.ca/cbc" rel="external" target="_blank">m-x.ca/cbc</a>.</p>
<p class="note sizeable">*subject to completion of the applicable regulatory process</p>

<p>Welcome to the International Derivatives Expo, or IDX as we affectionately call it. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see so many friends and colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter X contained in IDX is a perfect symbol for the crossroads that London represents. For generations, London is where the international community has come together to freely exchange goods, ideas and cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDX feels like a global family reunion among friends and colleagues. There are always hugs, laughter and double-cheeked kisses throughout the week. I&rsquo;m glad to be a part of such a welcoming global community during such interesting times.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we gather in London feeling anxious about the world we are living in. How can you not? You can&rsquo;t pick up a paper, turn on the news or look at your phone without being inundated with stories about the world falling apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of this is reality. There is more political unrest and conflict today than since the end of the cold war. There are many people feeling left behind by globalisation, and they are voting for more drastic policies and emboldened politicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology also plays a role in our uncertainty, as AI puts us on an exciting - but unknowable - path for humankind.&nbsp;But some of this uncertainty is self-induced. Social media and 24/7 news feed us stories that enflame FOMO, jealousy, tribalism and the other deadly sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is we are living in a modern world where technology improves yet complicates our lives. To quote Dickens, &ldquo;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m feeling anxious about the future, I recall the resilience and fortitude of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents and the challenges they faced&mdash;from world wars to depressions to famines. They took on these challenges at great personal sacrifice so our generation could live better lives.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to indulge you with the story of my great grandfather&mdash;Peder Johannes Ottasl&ouml;kken&mdash;who later Americanised his name to Peter John Lukken when he emigrated from Norway to the United States in 1870.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter was born in a small village near Lillehammer Norway to struggling farmers who relied on the teenage Peter to help. One snowy November morning, Peter set out on skis with his cousin Austen to hunt grouse in the nearby mountains to earn extra money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With three feet of snow on the ground, Peter and Austen came across large bear tracks that led them to a distant cave. With only ammunition for birds, they found shelter a mile away and melted what they had into larger bullets, using a smoking pipe to cast them. They had enough for one shot each&hellip;if the bullets worked at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next morning, they returned to the cave and seeing just the eyes of the bear in the darkness, they fired their rifles without knowing whether they or the bear would survive the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guns did fire, and Peter and Austen slayed the enormous bear and dragged it home over fourteen miles of snowy terrain. The boys netted $43 dollars, enough for a one-way ticket from Norway to America for Peter.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Peter came to America by himself&mdash;an immigrant with nothing to his name&mdash;and eventually settled in the South Dakota prairie where he homesteaded for five years to gain ownership of the land. This became the Lukken farm where he and his wife, Anna, raised 8 children. Yes, I am the proud product of a hardworking and resilient immigrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you have a similar story about relatives who have overcome great odds to impact the next generation for the better. So, when you feel anxious about our world, stop scrolling, remember our forebearers who sacrificed for us, and focus on those things that can make your life better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is great advice&mdash;not only for us personally&mdash;but for our industry as well. What decisions can we make today that will positively affect our industry down the road? I have three areas that I suggest we tackle as an industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Standardising our Trade Flow</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is standardizing our infrastructure, which has been a primary focus of FIA over the last several years. The roads, highways and on-ramps of our markets need our attention and investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many of you know, we have seen incredible volatility this year and record levels of trading volume.&nbsp;But extreme volatility creates real problems for our customers and puts a tremendous amount of stress on our infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Covid exposed this fragility as record volumes delayed allocated trades by days and sometimes weeks.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This led us to establish the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://dmist-standards.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Derivatives Market Institute for Standards</a>&nbsp;&ndash; or DMIST for short. The first standard we tackled was this very issue of making sure trades got in the right account on trade day. The resulting&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://dmist-standards.org/sites/default/files/2023-09/DMIST_Final%2030-30-30%20Standard.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">30-30-30 standard</a>&nbsp;sets out tight timelines for market participants to allocate or accept trades within 30 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adoption of this standard is beginning to bear fruit.&nbsp; The highest volume day in our industry occurred in April of this year, during President Trump&rsquo;s announcement on raising tariffs. It exceeded the previous daily record set during the Ukraine invasion by more than 10 percent and surpassed the record set during the Covid shutdown in 2020 by one-third.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with this growth, misallocated trades dropped by nearly 50 percent compared to the Ukraine peak.&nbsp; And a vast majority of those delayed trades were resolved within a day or two&mdash;not the several days we experienced in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not declaring victory. We still have an unacceptable number of trades that get snagged during normal and peak times.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to leverage DMIST&mdash;with its improved metrics&mdash;to focus our industry on the adoption of the 30-30-30 standard. Vendors are also building technology solutions to this standard to improve give-up transparency and monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, DMIST has a strategic roadmap for the next twelve months aimed at other market inefficiencies that include average pricing, position transfers, self-match prevention and data templates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investing in our infrastructure will take time, but it is already paying off. And it will provide needed capacity for our industry to grow. This is a worthwhile focus for our industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Modernising our Collateral Movement</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second issue worth our attention is modernising our payment rails through the adoption of distributed ledger technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, FIA released a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fia.org/fia/articles/adoption-tokenisation-beneficial-cleared-derivatives-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">white paper on tokenisation</a>&nbsp;and its potential to accelerate the movement of collateral for margin requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technology could lead to huge improvements in collateral management and settlement. It will make it possible to move collateral and meet margin requirements on holidays and weekends when banking systems are closed. It also could play an important role in the transition to 24/7 trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the sceptics, yes, I hear you. This idea has been around for many years. But I think we are at a turning point.&nbsp;For example, CME, DTCC, Eurex and ICE are actively exploring tokenised-based solutions for margin and settlement.&nbsp;Banks and asset management firms are also investing heavily in their own capacities to manage tokenized assets on blockchain networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public sector is studying tokenisation for modernising the public payment rails, with the Bank of England, Federal Reserve and the Monetary Authority of Singapore all focused on this promising technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIA plans to harness this potential through member education, like last week&rsquo;s whitepaper, targeted webinars and forums like this. FIA is also analysing whether regulations need to be addressed to facilitate blockchain&rsquo;s adoption. Lastly, we are seeking ways to collaborate with members on pilot projects and tabletop exercises that could advance this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, stay tuned. We will have more to say about this in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Simplifying our Regulations</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final topic we believe we can make a difference on is regulatory simplification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our industry is certainly not anti-regulation. Quite the opposite. Fit-for-purpose regulations bring fairness, clarity and predictability to our markets. Raising industry standards is part of FIA&rsquo;s mission and smart regulation helps us to accomplish this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, we welcome efforts by governments in the UK, EU and US to revisit and optimise the regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are coming to the end of a regulatory super cycle that began with the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Over the last 15 years, governments have placed layers and layers of regulation on financial firms, some certainly justified but some excessive and overly prescriptive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The compliance costs of these regulations have a real impact on our economic growth and productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of FIA&rsquo;s members, Nasdaq,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-report-identifies-between-25-billion-and-50-billion-potential-efficiency-gains" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">estimates</a>&nbsp;that regulatory rationalisation could produce between $25 and $50 billion in potential efficiency gains for banks. That would free up an additional $1 trillion in lending capacity globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news: there is an openness among the official sector to make regulatory systems more efficient and smarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sir Keir Starmer and his Labour Party have pushed for growth that includes streamlining regulations.&nbsp;The Draghi report and EU leaders have prioritised raising the economic productivity of the EU by simplifying their regulatory systems and cutting red tape.&nbsp;And we have begun to see similar efforts in the US at the CFTC and SEC under the new Administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, we can accomplish this enhanced productivity by streamlining our regulations without adding risk to the system. FIA is actively working with its members to identify regulatory pain points and find ways to reduce the burdens without sacrificing the safety and soundness of our markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I conclude, I recognise that we live in an uncertain world. But the opportunities before us are enormous.&nbsp;FIA is here to help and bring meaningful transformation to our markets that future generations will benefit from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Peter the Bear Hunter, our fore-bearers did not let the world just happen to them. They forged their future through determination and perseverance. I literally would not be here but for the courage of Peter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for our industry. Risk takers and innovators have brought us this far. Now it&rsquo;s our turn. We must be courageous. We must invest in the next generation of ideas, people and technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future is in our hands. Let&rsquo;s get to work.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Avenir Registrars Launches PISCES-Ready Registry Solutions - Register-Lite Product To Meet The Needs Of Fast Growth Companies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Avenir Registrars (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.avenir-registrars.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.avenir-registrars.co.uk</a>), the next-generation securities registrar, has this morning announced the release of its Register-lite suite of products. Designed to accommodate the needs of growth companies, including those who may be considering listing under the proposed PISCES framework, the flexible structure offers a CSD-compatible securities register where the functionality can be tailored to meet the company&rsquo;s needs as they grow.</p>
<p>Hardeep Tamana, Managing Director of Avenir Registrars, commented:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Technology has always been at the heart of the Avenir proposition. By tailoring our existing suite of registry products, we have launched Register-lite to deliver a right-sized solution, allowing growth companies to manage their shareholder register - or cap table &ndash; in a way that is both functional and future-proof. Unlike other products on the market, Register-lite is fully compatible with a CSD, enabling companies to migrate seamlessly to more formal market structures as they grow.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>With more companies staying private for longer, PISCES offers a once in a generation opportunity to reinvigorate London as a capital market. Founders and early stage investors will benefit from a verifiable market price for their investments, as well as having the ability to liquidate holdings or raise fresh capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jai Baker, Head of Business Development at Avenir Registrars, added:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;With the PISCES project now coming to fruition, we taking action to bridge some of the gaps that exist in the infrastructure that will be required to support those businesses who may be considering the framework at some point in time. Our flexible and modular registry services offer issuers a right sized solution that can grow to meet their needs, significantly reducing future administrative burdens.&rdquo;</i><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The accurate recording of shareholder names and any subsequent transfer of ownership is a vital role that needs to be undertaken by any UK business to ensure compliance with the Companies Act. A Central Securities Depositary (CSD) plays a critical role in managing this process, especially as transactions in a company&rsquo;s security grow in volume. Ensuring cap tables or registers can seamlessly integrate with a CSD can prove instrumental in supporting the growth of a business.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Global investment managers process live futures orders through InTick, partnering with a Tier 1 Executing Broker</span></em></strong></span> </li>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Brings innovation and automation to traditionally opaque, highly complex and manual futures block trading processes&nbsp;</span></em></strong></span> </li>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Improves efficiency, price discovery and trading outcomes to benefit buy-side and sell-side participants</span></em></strong><strong><em><span><br /><br /></span></em></strong></span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span>InTick, the listed derivatives blocking network, today announced that its block matching platform is now live and facilitating the exchange of active futures block orders across its platform.&nbsp;<span>The InTick platform went live during the June ICE Gilt and Eurex Fixed Income futures rolls, replicating some of the most sophisticated and complex&nbsp;</span>listed derivatives&nbsp;<span>workflow strategies that investors implement to mitigate risk, manage volatility and demonstrate best execution.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>InTick brings innovation and automation to the traditionally opaque, highly complex and manual futures block trading processes, addressing the inefficiencies experienced when executing and booking exchange-traded assets. With the ability to show axes across different contracts now live, the InTick network is growing at pace.<br /><br /></span><span>Traditionally, futures block trading involves a significant degree of manual pre-and-post trade information exchanges. These are highly complicated workflows that are costly, inefficient and time-intensive for both sell-side and buy-side participants.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The lack of electronification, centralised pricing information and independent matching</span>&nbsp;<span>makes futures blocking one of the last areas of trading that has remained untouched by the innovations prevalent in other asset classes,&nbsp;</span>placing unnecessary constraints on broker choices and the ability to participate in block trading.</span></p>
<p><span>InTick enables electronic all-to-all client matching for both equities and fixed income futures markets via a consolidated order book, aggregating all available Listed Derivative block liquidity in one platform.<br /><br /><strong>James Goater, CEO of InTick, said</strong>:&ldquo;We are very excited to finally see our vision for meaningful change in futures block trading come to life. It&rsquo;s so great to have realised the innovation that has been lacking for so long in this area of trading, and it is particularly gratifying to see how both buy and sell side participants are embracing the change that is so desired and needed&rdquo;.<br /><br /><span>&ldquo;With InTick, we are fully challenging the status quo of high-touch, listed derivatives block trading. Across the market, we are now solving the significant inefficiencies in executing and blocking exchange-traded assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>InTick</span></strong><span>&nbsp;is a fully centralised hub for price dissemination and discovery for listed derivatives block trading and is authorised as an FCA Appointed Representative.&nbsp;</span>InTick is&nbsp;the golden source of independent, evidence-based pricing that enables optimal trading decisions and trusted execution analysis.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The InTick platform&nbsp;</span>supports all-to-all trading as well as RFQ price discovery via fully automated, front-to-back listed exchange block trading.&nbsp;<span>It empowers trading participants with actionable liquidity insights from an automated, simplified and transparent platform that centralises traditional processes and workflow information, thereby removing the cost and complexity of futures block trading.</span><span><br /><br /></span></span><span><strong><span>Darren Upton, CIO iSAM Vector, commented</span></strong><span>: &ldquo;Congratulations to InTick on reaching this significant milestone.&nbsp; InTick offers significant benefits to accessing block liquidity for Listed Derivatives, and we are excited about the opportunities they can bring to iSAM&rdquo;</span><span><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Ben Parker, Co-Founder and COO of InTick, added:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a very exciting milestone for the business and for the industry as a whole. We now have an opportunity to deliver the benefits of digitised</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>processes&nbsp;</span><span>to those organisations looking to&nbsp;</span>embrace innovation, optimise block futures trading and drive business growth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;<span>Our aim is to expand the listed derivative blocking network and open new trading opportunities for all market participants.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced that the first trade in Custom Basket Futures has been made by University of Cambridge Investment Management Limited with a notional value of &euro;80 million.</p>
<p>University of Cambridge Investment Management Limited (&ldquo;UCIM&rdquo;) is the investment company that manages the Cambridge University Endowment Fund, with a mission to provide world-class, sustainable investment performance. UCIM is the first organization to trade Nasdaq Custom Basket Futures &ndash; a product that allows investors to create a custom-made equity basket that is specified by return type, currency, and chosen from a pool of equities, in this case to exclude conventional energy, supporting a core part of UCIM&rsquo;s sustainable investment strategy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasdaq Custom Basket Futures enhance UCIM's ability to further reduce exposure to conventional energy within the passive component of the endowment&rsquo;s public equity portfolio, supporting progress towards our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2038,&rdquo; said Sarah Wood, Associate Director, Marketable Assets, UCIM.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been a pleasure to work with the Nasdaq team as it developed an innovative, efficient solution for UCIM and its stakeholders at the University of Cambridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Custom Basket offering was first launched with Custom Basket Forwards. In March 2025 the offering was expanded to include Futures. The solution reflects Nasdaq commitment to driving innovation and increasing accessibility in the capital markets by offering a more streamlined and transparent way to manage bespoke equity exposures. It enables clients to use standardized contracts traded on a regulated market &mdash; with central counterparty clearing &mdash; instead of relying on over-the-counter equity swaps. Since launch, the equity universe has grown from European equities to also include U.S. equities, now covering over 2,200 stocks across 16 countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to announce the first trade for Nasdaq Custom Basket Futures in partnership with UCIM &mdash; an important milestone in our product evolution,&rdquo; said Julian Butterworth, Head of Sales, European Market Services, Nasdaq. &ldquo;This offering is a strong example of how we are delivering innovative tools that empower investors to tailor their exposures while benefiting from the transparency and security of regulated markets.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Malta's Financial Sector Grows Steadily As Malta Financial Services Authority Sharpens Oversight And Protection</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/maltas-financial-sector-grows-steadily-as-malta-financial-services-authority-sh-2025617/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/maltas-financial-sector-grows-steadily-as-malta-financial-services-authority-sh-2025617/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has published its 2024 Annual Report, outlining a year of regulatory progress, strategic reform, and close collaboration with stakeholders both locally and internationally. The report highlights the Authority's efforts to bolster market oversight, support a growing financial services sector, and place consumer protection at the heart of its operations.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg3b45left"><img align="middle" alt="Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) Building" id="prnejpg3b45left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2711041/MFSA_Building.jpg" title="Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) Building" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of an evolving economic landscape, Malta's financial services sector continues to demonstrate resilience. The industry now accounts for 8.2% of the country's real Gross Value Added (GVA), a 0.2 percentage point increase over the previous year. Employment in the sector has also expanded steadily, with 14,745 individuals employed as of October 2024&mdash;5.1% of Malta's total gainfully employed population. Since 2020, the sector's workforce has grown by 21.6%, a sign of ongoing demand and investor interest.</p>
<p>At the regulatory level, 2024 was marked by increased supervisory engagement, with supervisory interactions rising by 33% year-on-year. The Authority took 134 enforcement actions, issuing &euro;926,485 in penalties, alongside 49 public warnings and 5 consumer notices, underlining its proactive approach to upholding market integrity.</p>
<p><b>Guiding the Industry and Informing the Public</b></p>
<p>Throughout the year, the MFSA stepped up efforts to safeguard consumer interests, identifying emerging risks early and guiding firms toward fairer, more transparent practices. Regulatory expectations were clearly communicated across the industry through regular stakeholder engagement. In 2024, the MFSA, hosted eleven industry conferences and workshops, issued 119 circulars, and published 15 "Dear CEO" letters.</p>
<p>Consumer education remained a key priority. Campaigns focusing on topics such as financial scams, greenwashing and bond investments helped simplify financial products for retail users, empowering individuals to make better-informed decisions.</p>
<p><b>Investing in People and Talent</b></p>
<p>The Authority reinforced its position as a forward-thinking employer by investing significantly in training and professional development. Over 24,600 training hours were delivered via the Authority's Financial Supervisors Academy. In 2024, the MFSA also collaborated with the University of Malta to launch a Postgraduate Diploma in Financial Regulation and Compliance, which is now running for the second year, with applications closing on 23 July 2025.</p>
<p><b>Strengthening International and Local Ties</b></p>
<p>International engagement remained a priority in 2024. MFSA officials participated in over 150 international forums and held high-level meetings with global standard setters including the European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Commission. Meetings were also held with other foreign regulators to exchange best practices.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, partnerships with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) and the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) contributed to a more harmonised approach to regulatory reporting aimed at further reducing administrative burden on the industry, as well as financial crime prevention, and systemic risk mitigation.</p>
<p><b>A Vision for the Future</b></p>
<p>Reflecting on the achievements of the past year, MFSA Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Farrugia commented:</p>
<p><i>"In 2024, the MFSA made significant strides in enhancing supervision, aligning with international best practices, and strengthening consumer protection. Our people remain at the heart of our strategy, and we are proud of the culture of excellence we continue to build.

<title>Trading Technologies Launches Pre-Trade Portfolio Risk Functionality For TT® Platform - New Offering Replicates Clearing House Methodologies To Mitigate Risk, Facilitate More Trading Opportunities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/trading-technologies-launches-pre-trade-portfolio-risk-functionality-for-tt-pla-2025617/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/trading-technologies-launches-pre-trade-portfolio-risk-functionality-for-tt-pla-2025617/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, has launched Pre-Trade Portfolio Risk on the TT platform, bringing new protections to sell-side clients and facilitating increased trading opportunities for end-users. TT announced the new offering leading into the FIA IDX conference today in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">London</span>.</p>
<p>With this functionality, firms can now manage risk more effectively by capturing a client's worst-case margin position at a given time and use the value to determine whether there is sufficient buying power before an order is sent to the market.&nbsp;The new offering uniquely applies the same calculations employed by clearing houses, giving FCMs the ability to more comprehensively manage client exposure.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Alun Green</span>, EVP Managing Director, Futures &amp; Options for TT, said: "This is a significant step forward in managing risk that will allow a wider range of users to benefit from the award-winning trading features available on the TT platform. Users will easily be able to see how much margin has been consumed by their existing portfolio and how much buying power remains for trading."</p>
<p>Pre-Trade Portfolio Risk supports a variety of exchange risk protocols, including SPAN, PRISMA, value-at-risk (VAR) and other custom models, across more than 20 major derivatives exchanges. It directly leverages risk parameter files supplied by the exchange to reflect the most up-to-date values and can be managed at any account level in the TT platform.</p>
<p>The TT platform, which handled more than 2.8 billion derivatives transactions alone in 2024, is the most widely used platform globally for futures and options on futures, in addition to its growing use across multiple asset classes. The platform has earned numerous recognitions in 2025 for its high-performance technology and functionality, including Derivatives Trading System of the Year in this month's Markets Media 2025 Global Markets Choice Awards.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FSA published the English version of "FSA Analytical Notes (2025.5) ".&nbsp;<img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250530/01.pdf">full text</a></p>
<p>As financial institutions&rsquo; business environments and profit structures change, it is important to understand economic and market trends based on data, and to accurately grasp the business conditions of individual financial institutions and also the resilience and vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole. From this perspective, the FSA&nbsp;has been focusing on the utilization of granular data, such as transaction-level bank loan data and financial data on individual corporations. Some case examples of data analyses using such granular data are published as a series of reports titled &ldquo;FSA Analytical Notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This issue contains two analyses on: 1) Attempt to effectively utilize text data by applying AI technologies, and 2) Current trends in deposits under the increasing interest rate environment.</p>
<div class="mt20"><img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><strong><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250530/02.pdf">Attempt to effectively utilize text data by applying AI technologies</a></strong></div>
<div class="mb20">
<p>This paper applies AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), to analyze textual data from financial institutions&rsquo; disclosure publications. By extracting texts related to designated themes from large volumes of text, the analysis identifies institution-type-specific characteristics and time-series trends. Focusing on real estate and housing loans, the results reveal that key terms and descriptive patterns differ across institution types. The proposed approach is expected to offer more efficient information gathering and the early detection of emerging signals. Future efforts will continue to incorporate text data analysis into monitoring frameworks, while carefully considering the specific risks associated with AI.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="mt20"><img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><strong><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250530/03.pdf">Current trends in deposits under the increasing interest rate environment</a></strong></div>
<div class="mb20">
<p>This report analyzes the current trends in deposit balances and deposit interest rates under the increasing interest rate environment. While overall deposit balances are increasing, differences in growth rates are observed depending on institution type and deposit type. A positive correlation between deposit yields-particularly those influenced by deposit campaigns-and deposit balance growth are observed. The FSA will continue to analyze deposit trends in a timely manner, while capturing macroeconomic trends such as the interest rate environment and demographic shifts.</p>
</div>
<p>Enhancing the use of data in financial supervision and policy-making is a medium- to long-term agenda. The FSA will continue to build its data analysis capabilities and data infrastructure.</p>
<div class="in-1hang mt20">

<title>US Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Comment To Address Payments And Check Fraud</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-bank-regulatory-agencies-seek-comment-to-address-payments-and-check-f-2025617/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced a request for comment on potential actions to help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions mitigate risk of payments fraud, with a particular focus on check fraud. For purposes of the request for information, payments fraud generally refers to the use of illegal means to make or receive payments for personal gain, including scams.</p>
<p>Because payments fraud may involve multiple institutions and payment methods, no single agency or private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. Therefore, the agencies are seeking public comment on discrete actions, collectively or independently, to mitigate payments fraud, including check fraud, within their respective bank regulation and payments authorities.</p>
<p>Input is requested on five potential areas for improvement and collaboration:</p>
<ul>
<li>External collaboration among the agencies, Federal Reserve Banks, and industry stakeholders;</li>
<li>Consumer, business, and industry education by the agencies and Federal Reserve Banks to educate about payments fraud;</li>
<li>Regulation and supervision to mitigate payments fraud, including opportunities the Board may have related to check fraud;</li>
<li>Payments fraud data collection and information sharing; and</li>
<li>Federal Reserve Banks&rsquo; operator tools and services to reduce payments fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to seeking public input, the agencies will also continue looking for additional opportunities to effectively collaborate across other state and federal agencies given the importance of interagency coordination to help mitigate payments fraud.</p>
<p>Comments must be received within 90 days after date of publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham today issued the following statement on the passing of the Hon. William T. Bagley, the CFTC&rsquo;s first chairman:</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Chairman Bagley was instrumental in laying the foundation for what has become the world&rsquo;s preeminent derivatives regulator. As the first CFTC chairman, he shepherded our agency through its first years, executing on once-novel Congressional authorities and establishing a regulatory framework to expand risk mitigation tools for America&rsquo;s growers, producers, builders and merchants. Fifty years after Chairman Bagley first opened the doors at the CFTC, this framework continues to be critical in driving the American economy forward. We celebrate Chairman Bagley&rsquo;s life and legacy and owe him a debt of gratitude for his years of service to our markets, our economy, and our Nation.&nbsp; On behalf of the entire CFTC community, I extend my condolences to Chairman Bagley&rsquo;s family.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left">The Upper Tribunal has upheld the Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (FCA) decision that Craig Donaldson and David Arden, former Chief Executive (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Metro Bank (Metro), were knowingly concerned in a breach of the Listing Rules.</p>
<p align="left">As a company listed on the stock exchange, Metro provided quarterly financial results to the market. In these, Metro regularly reported on its prudential position, including the Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) on which its regulatory capital requirements are based.</p>
<p align="left">On 24 October 2018, Metro published an unqualified statement of the Metro's RWA, and the capital ratios based on it. Metro knew at the time of a material error with the data, but did not inform the market. When amended numbers were published in January 2019, there was a 39% drop in Metro&rsquo;s share price.</p>
<p align="left">The FCA fined Metro &pound;10,002,300 for breaching the Listing Rules in December 2022.</p>
<p align="left">Mr Donaldson as CEO and Mr Arden as CFO at Metro at the time of the announcement were aware of the material error and involved in the decision to publish the incorrect information.</p>
<p align="left">Steve Smart, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</p>
<p align="left"><em>&ldquo;Investors make decisions based on information shared by listed companies. They must be able to trust it&rsquo;s accurate. Mr Arden and Mr Donaldson allowed information they knew to be wrong to be published.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Key Regulatory Products On Operational Risk Capital Requirements And Related Supervisory Reporting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published three final draft technical standards that are crucial for the implementation of the EU Banking Package and will allow supervisors to monitor institutions&rsquo; compliance, thus&nbsp;fostering consistent and enhanced supervision.</span></p>
<p>In particular, the EBA is publishing the following Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Implementing Technical Standards (ITS):</p>
<ul>
<li>RTS concerning the calculation and adjustments of the Business Indicator (BI), which is central to the standardised and harmonised application of the operational risk capital requirements.</li>
<li>ITS on the mapping to FINREP, which will ensure consistency and reduce implementation, administrative and operational costs.</li>
<li>Amending&nbsp;ITS on operational risk reporting, which will keep the supervisory reporting framework relevant, meaningful and aligned with the amended regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The EBA has refined the BI components, incorporating updates to accounting standards, detailed breakdowns of operational risk impacts and exclusions, as well as further clarifications on the approaches for calculating the financial component. These changes ensure comprehensive and accurate representation of operational risk in banks' financial statements.</p>
<p>When an institution undergoes a merger or acquisition, the final RTS mandate the use of actual three-year historical data or provide alternative methodologies if this is not feasible. For disposals, the final RTS outline conditions for excluding BI items related to disposed entities, while a materiality threshold for disposals is introduced, allowing adjustments without supervisory permission for minor disposals. This ensures clarity for institutions with frequent, low-impact disposals.</p>
<p>The standard items for each component of the BI were matched to their respective reporting cells in FINREP, with the outcome being presented in the final ITS on BI mapping.</p>
<p>The final report on supervisory reporting introduces amendments to the operational risk reporting framework, aimed at assessing compliance with operational risk own funds requirements. It enhances existing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-updates-supervisory-reporting-framework">reporting requirements</a>&nbsp;by requesting additional details on the calculation of business indicator components. This ensures that supervisory authorities have access to essential data to fulfill their mandates, while also considering the effort required by institutions to meet these data requirements.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>These mandates are part of the Phase 2 of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf">EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package</a>.</p>
<p>Article 314(9)(a) and (b)&nbsp;of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR), mandates the EBA to develop draft RTS to&nbsp;further specify the components of the BI by developing a list of items and the elements to be excluded from the BI, respectively.&nbsp;Article 314(10) of the CRR, mandates the EBA to develop draft ITS to provide the mapping of the items of the BI to the corresponding reporting cells in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 (FINREP).&nbsp;Article 315(3) of the CRR3 mandates the EBA to draft RTS to specify &ldquo;how institutions shall determine the adjustments to the business indicator&rdquo; (point (a) of Article 315(3) referencing mergers, acquisitions and disposals), &ldquo;the conditions according to which competent authorities may grant the permission&rdquo; and &ldquo;the timing of the adjustments&rdquo; (points (b) and (c) of Article 315(3)&nbsp;referencing disposals only).</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (&lsquo;the CRR&rsquo;) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR 3&rsquo;) mandates the EBA, in article 430(7), to develop draft implementing technical standards to specify uniform reporting formats, and IT solutions, including instructions, for supervisory reporting requirements of institutions.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>After the submission of the final draft ITS to the Commission for adoption, the EBA will publish on the website the IT tools, including binding instructions. The EBA will publish during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-40">Q4 2025 a technical package</a>, including the DPM, validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by institutions to submit this supervisory reporting information to supervisors. The first applicable reference date for reporting under the draft ITS is 31 March 2026.</p>
<p>An updated version of the mapping tool between supervisory reporting and disclosure requirements for Operational risk will be published soon.</p>

<title>25 Years Of EEX: From A Local Power Trading Platform To A Global Commodity Exchange</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/25-years-of-eex-from-a-local-power-trading-platform-to-a-global-commodity-excha-2025616/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/25-years-of-eex-from-a-local-power-trading-platform-to-a-global-commodity-excha-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) marks its 25th anniversary this year, with a total volume of 75,000+ terawatt hours of power traded since launch. Today the company is known as a global exchange for energy and commodities and has been recognised as the world&rsquo;s largest power trading platform for almost a decade.</p>
<p>The very first trade was executed on 15 June 2000 at Leipzig Power Exchange, the predecessor of today&rsquo;s EEX, at the time of a major transformation of the European energy landscape. In the late 1990s, the German electricity market was liberalised, ending local monopolies and opening up the market to new entrants which created the need for transparent and efficiently organised trading platforms, such as EEX.</p>
<p>25 years on, EEX is a globally active group of companies with over 1,200 employees across 25 locations, and with an annual trading volume of more than 12,000 terawatt hours, as reported for 2024. In addition to power contracts, the wider EEX Group now offers natural gas, emission allowances, freight, guarantees of origin and other commodity products, which are traded by 950+ participants from 42 countries. To underpin EEX Group&rsquo;s commitment to its sustainability targets, it provides tailored contracts and services to facilitate the energy transition, the integration of renewables, as well as decarbonisation efforts.</p>
<p>Thomas Book, Chairman of the EEX Supervisory Board and member of the Executive Board of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG, comments: &ldquo;<em>Since its inception as a startup in 2000, EEX made a fantastic journey to becoming a globally leading energy market. We are very proud of the EEX team and their outstanding achievements. EEX not only made a significant contribution to the success of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group but also continues to drive transformation in global energy markets through reliable price discovery and strong risk management. We look forward to the next chapters in this journey of innovation and client focus to facilitate transformation in global energy markets.</em>"</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>EEX is a true success story. The trust we receive from our exchange participants, the cooperation with our customers and partners, the high level of commitment by our teams worldwide and the support of our shareholders have been decisive factors for our development over the past 25 years. The energy market is in constant change and so are the needs of trading participants. We will continue to develop and build our markets together with our customers and thus make our contribution to liquid, sustainable and secure trading.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA22-50751485-1546_2024_Annual_Report.pdf">Annual Report for 2024</a>. The activities conducted and results achieved in 2024 support ESMA&rsquo;s strategic priorities and thematic drivers - to foster stable and effective markets, strengthen supervision, and enhance retail investor protection while enabling sustainable finance and facilitating technological innovation and the use of data.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In 2024, the EU transitioned from one institutional cycle to the next, while being impacted by changes in the economic and geopolitical circumstances. These changes started to reshape and refocus the priorities of the EU and ESMA. ESMA was active in a rich debate about Europe&rsquo;s challenges and the critical role that capital markets need to play in order to overcome them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>A major milestone for ESMA was the publication of the position paper introducing&nbsp;20 recommendations for strengthening the effectiveness of the EU capital markets and addressing the needs of European citizens and businesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Through putting into practice the spirit of its recommendations, ESMA made significant progress or finalised measures across its remit, at it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Finalised the Report on shortening the settlement cycle to T+1, a significant step forward in improving markets efficiency and competitiveness and launched the implementation work;</span></li>
<li><span>Finalised the Rules and guidance for the selection of consolidated tape providers (CTPs);</span></li>
<li><span>Finalised the policy work under the regulatory regime for crypto-assets, dedicated significant efforts to promote consistency in the application of the new rules and put in place an integrated monitoring of the crypto-asset markets;</span></li>
<li><span>Made significant&nbsp;progress in the development of the European Single Access Point (ESAP), which will become operational in 2026 and bring simplification and benefits to investors and the industry;</span></li>
<li><span>Implemented steps to optimise the use of financial market data across the EU, while at the same time introducing the changes in the transparency framework&nbsp;under the MiFIR review that will contribute to a significant reduction in the reporting burden for market participants;</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced investor protection by running common supervisory actions and a mystery shopping exercise on marketing communications which allowed ESMA to identify and publicise key risks;</span></li>
<li><span>Improved the information available to investors by issuing guidelines on the use of ESG and sustainability-related terms in fund names to reduce the risk of greenwashing; and</span></li>
<li><span>Strengthened ESMA&rsquo;s role as a data hub by upgrading data collection and analysis, advancing AI-powered tools and improving data accessibility, and migrating all ESMA&rsquo;s datasets and analytical tools to its new &lsquo;big data&rsquo; platform.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESMA significantly advanced its supervisory effectiveness in 2024, scaling up risk-based and data-driven supervision across its mandates. Key actions included the execution of EU-wide stress tests with over 30 central counterparties (CCPs), the enhancement of third-country CCP oversight, enforcement measures such as the sanctioning of a credit rating agency for conflicts of interest, and the roll-out of transversal guidelines to harmonise supervisory practices. ESMA also published the first consolidated report on sanctions and measures imposed by the NCAs and launched supervisory colleges for complex cross-border entities. These efforts reflect ESMA&rsquo;s commitment to effective supervision, now also tracked through a dedicated Key Outcome Indicator measuring the proportion of elevated supervisory risks addressed through direct supervision and convergence actions.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, ESMA focused on preparations for new supervisory mandates notably in relation to its upcoming supervisory role over EU green bond verifiers and ESG rating providers, as well as ensuring a sound process for the selection and authorisation of the future CTPs.</span></p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders Texas Firm To Pay Over $100 Million To Customers Defrauded In Cattle Fraud Scheme - Firm’s Co-Founders Ordered To Disgorge Over $2.2 Million In Unlawful Gains</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-court-orders-texas-firm-to-pay-over-100-million-to-customers-defrauded-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered a final judgment and consent order imposing a permanent injunction and equitable remedies against&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Agridime LLC</strong></span><span>, a Texas firm now in receivership.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The consent order requires Agridime to pay $102,936,904 in restitution and permanently enjoins Agridime from engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, and permanently bans Agridime from registering with the CFTC and from solicitating and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The consent order further states the restitution obligation shall be satisfied by the collection efforts and resulting distributions by the receiver appointed in the parallel SEC action to defrauded customers. [SEC v. Agridime LLC, et al., 4:23-cv-01224-P (N.D. Tex. Dec. 11, 2023)].</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC also announced the court entered a final judgment by default against Agridime&rsquo;s co-founders,&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Joshua Link</strong></span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Jed Wood</strong></span><span>. The default judgment orders Link to pay disgorgement of $815,327.92 and Wood to pay disgorgement of $1,472,127.92. These disgorgement amounts represent gains received, respectively, by Link and Wood in connection with the violations alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s May 2024 complaint. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8911-24">8911-24</a><span>]. The default judgment further states that Link and Wood shall make payments of their disgorgement obligations, and any post-judgment interest payments, to the receiver for distribution to defrauded customers. The default judgment also permanently enjoins Link and Wood from further violating the CEA and CFTC regulations, as charged, and imposes trading and registration bans.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span><strong>Case Background</strong></span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The consent order and default judgment stem from a CFTC complaint filed against the defendants Agridime, Link, and Wood in May 2024.&nbsp; [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8911-24">8911-24</a><span>]. The complaint alleged the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud customers by soliciting, accepting, and using customer funds to pay other customers in the nature of a Ponzi scheme, rather than for the purposes Agridime said the funds would be used, in connection with contracts of sale of a commodity in interstate commerce (i.e., the customer&rsquo;s purchase of cattle).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>According to the complaint, Agridime represented that customers&rsquo; funds would be used only for the purchase, raising, and feeding of the purchased cattle. Instead, because Agridime did not buy the number of cattle required to fulfill its obligations under the livestock contracts, Agridime had to use &nbsp;recently collected customers&rsquo; funds to pay the guaranteed profits of earlier customers.&nbsp;In addition, as further alleged in the complaint, customers&rsquo; funds were also used to pay millions in undisclosed commissions to Agridime personnel, including Link and Wood.&nbsp; Link&rsquo;s and Wood&rsquo;s disgorgement obligations are based on the gains they received in connection with their fraud, including undisclosed commissions.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The Division of Enforcement thanks the Fort Worth Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Arizona Corporation Commission&rsquo;s Securities Division, for their assistance in this matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Janine Gargiulo, Nicole Buseman, Judith M. Slowly, Trevor Kokal, Lenel Hickson, Jr., Manal M. Sultan, Charles D. Marvine, and former employee David W. MacGregor.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>* * * * * *</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span><strong>CFTC&rsquo;s Fraud Advisories</strong></span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/learnandprotect/learningresources">advisories and articles</a><span>, including information about forex, precious metals, and romance scams. Visit&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">CFTC.gov</a><span>&nbsp;to read more about these highly prevalent frauds.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using NFA BASIC.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint">file a tip or complaint online</a><span>&nbsp;or contact the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a><span>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</span></p>

<title>Invest Hong Kong Fosters Mutual Engagement Through Successful Delegations To Gulf Cooperation Council Region</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/invest-hong-kong-fosters-mutual-engagement-through-successful-delegations-to-gul-2025616/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/invest-hong-kong-fosters-mutual-engagement-through-successful-delegations-to-gul-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) continues to promote both inward and outward investment, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a global business hub. InvestHK embarked on a visit to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region from May 9 to 16, with stops in Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Significant progress was made in forging robust partnerships and generating tangible business outcomes. The visit also aligns with the momentum driven by the Chief Executive's visit to the Middle East in May, during which three Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) were signed by InvestHK.</p>
<p>The delegation comprised leaders from prominent financial services and fintech companies, founded locally, in Mainland China or overseas with operations in Hong Kong. They participated in high-level strategic meetings with senior management of local government organisations, chambers of commerce, sovereign wealth funds, private equity partners and tech incubators, facilitated by InvestHK.</p>
<p>The Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, "In today's evolving global economy, Hong Kong has showcased its irreplaceable strategic value as a 'super connector'. Our city's unique advantage lies in its ability to effectively connect the East with the West and the Global South. At InvestHK, we are continuously strengthening our core role in facilitating business connectivity, with a firm commitment to delivering value-added services to Mainland and overseas companies looking to establish themselves in Hong Kong and expand globally. We recognise opportunities in high-potential markets, such as the GCC region, which are actively diversifying their economies through innovations. By partnering with InvestHK, companies can effectively access these competitive markets with the government support."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bridging markets and transforming outcomes: turning vision into action</b></p>
<p>The Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech &amp; Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung, added, "Our support for the delegation was very results driven, opening essential government-to-government (G2G) and business-to-business doors for them. Leveraging our in-depth understanding of each participating company, we successfully showcased Hong Kong as an efficient platform for connecting high-quality enterprises, earning broad recognition from local governments, businesses, and investors across the GCC region. This growing collaboration and trust are built on aligning the right expertise, the right people, and the right connectors. Together, we are creating meaningful bridges that transform relationships into tangible business outcomes."</p>
<p>Over the past two years, companies such as EvidentGroup, LianLian Global, Lingfeng Capital, OneDegree, 4Paradigm, Libertify and more participated in the delegations. Delegates acknowledged that remarkable results would not have been possible without opportunities and connections provided by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government.</p>
<p>For Evident Group, a highlight was an MOU signing with Zand Bank, the UAE's AI-powered bank, licensed by the Central Bank of the UAE, which Evident first connected with during last year's delegation visit. The MOU signifies a commitment to develop a strategic collaboration, aimed at delivering innovative alternative investment solutions for Zand Bank's private wealth clients. The goal is to leverage Evident's secure, cutting-edge digital market infrastructure to facilitate access to alternative investments such as private equity secondaries, private credit, and tokenised infrastructure. This collaboration pioneers a new model, demonstrating how the digitalisation of private markets enhances Hong Kong's role in linking global private wealth with unique investment opportunities.</p>
<p>LianLian Global regards Hong Kong as a key hub for expanding its global ecosystem, particularly in the GCC region. Through InvestHK delegations, it forged key G2G ties, most notably with the Central Bank of the UAE, unlocking strategic opportunities in the region. At the Dubai FinTech Summit, LianLian reached a cooperation agreement with Lulu Money to extend its payment gateway services into Mainland China. Leveraging Hong Kong as a fund hub, it also addressed cross-border trade challenges between China and the Middle East and North Africa region. In one case, LianLian facilitated a procurement and payment solution for a company purchasing electric vehicles from China, streamlining transactions for both buyer and manufacturer.</p>
<p>Lingfeng Capital has obtained its approved-in-principle from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority as a licensed fund manager in the UAE and established operations in Abu Dhabi as its regional headquarters after identifying opportunities during the first delegation visit last year. This year, Lingfeng Capital is further engaging with key partners and initiating the setup of a fund in Abu Dhabi to support portfolio companies from Hong Kong, Mainland and other international markets expanding into the GCC region.</p>
<p>OneDegree has been recognised by GCC government officials for its industry-leading digital asset insurance offerings. Following an investment from Dubai Insurance, OneDegree is set to provide digital asset insurance in the UAE, having received approval from the Central Bank of the UAE through partnership with Dubai Insurance Co. In addition, Walaa is supplying reinsurance capital for OneDegree's global digital asset book. A pivotal milestone was a private meeting with senior management of the Insurance Authority of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the delegation visit last year.</p>
<p><b>Connecting the East with the West and the Global South</b></p>
<p>The 2025 delegation led by InvestHK built on the solid foundation laid by the HKSAR Government officials during earlier trip to focus on driving tangible business results, further solidifying Hong Kong's position as an outward-facing, globally connected economy. The success of these delegations reaffirms Hong Kong's position as a "super connector" and "super value-adder" to the world, where innovation and strategic dialogue forge robust pathways for two-way economic growth. With tangible results achieved across sectors, InvestHK continues to empower enterprises to "go global" through Hong Kong. Looking ahead, these achievements will lay the foundation for transformative regional collaborations that will benefit Hong Kong and contribute to national policies supporting global trade and investment, further deepening international exchanges and co-operation.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Calero, the leading solution for managing cost and compliance market data, announced today a new API integration and eBonding capabilities with financial technology and data provider LSEG&rsquo;s Refinitiv Data Platform (Hosted). This addition delivers Heads of Market Data and other leaders much-needed automation to what was a manual process of managing LSEG entitlements.</p>
<p>Until now, the process for managing LSEG&rsquo;s Refinitiv Data Platform (Hosted) was entirely manual, requiring phone calls and emails with LSEG Account reps or manual order entry into LSEG portals. Calero&rsquo;s new capabilities automate access requests, changes, and cancellations to eliminate manual reconciliation and email-based workflows, provide real-time visibility into hosted entitlements, eliminate manual errors, and allow straight-through processing. These industry-leading enhancements provide IT, procurement, and finance stakeholders with unparalleled transparency and control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These enhancements represent a major step forward in Calero&rsquo;s vision to eliminate manual processes from market data management,&rdquo; says Alistair Brooker, Calero Vice President/General Manager. &ldquo;With the LSEG Hosted Access integration, customers receive the comprehensive automation they&rsquo;ve long demanded &ndash; from real-time visibility into their inventory to straight-through change processing. We will continue to provide firms of all sizes with solutions to be smarter, faster, and in more control of their data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calero&rsquo;s industry-leading Market Data Management (MDM) platform enables organisations to meet market data challenges around transparency, compliance, procurement, and inventory accuracy while also uncovering substantial cost savings. Many financial institutions and energy trading companies spend over $500 million annually on market data sources while dedicating significant resources to meeting heavy compliance and audit requirements as well as understanding service changes. Calero&rsquo;s MDM platform helps streamline those operations.</p>

<title>ABN AMRO Joins CLSSettlement</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/abn-amro-joins-clssettlement-2025616/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/abn-amro-joins-clssettlement-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions, today announced that ABN AMRO has re-joined CLSSettlement as a settlement member effective May 5. The bank joins 73 other leading banks in becoming a settlement member in CLSSettlement.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO was part of the first group of settlement members that went live in CLSSettlement when the service launched in 2002. It subsequently transitioned to indirect participation as a third-party participant in 2009. The bank&rsquo;s recent decision to re-join as a settlement member highlights its commitment to reducing FX settlement risk and improving operational efficiency through payment-versus-payment (PvP) solutions.</p>
<p>CLSSettlement is recognized as the global standard for FX settlement risk mitigation, settling over USD7 trillion of payment instructions daily across 18 of the most traded currencies.</p>
<p>As the FX market evolves, the demand for secure and efficient settlement mechanisms continues to grow, particularly among financial institutions seeking to align with the settlement risk best practices outlined in Principle 35 of the FX Global Code<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, ABN AMRO will offer third-party access to CLSSettlement for its clients, further demonstrating its commitment to implementing robust FX settlement risk management practices and operational excellence within the broader FX ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Danino-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer, CLS&nbsp;</b>said: &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome ABN AMRO as a settlement member to CLSSettlement. The bank&rsquo;s decision reflects the wider benefits of CLS&rsquo;s PvP settlement system, such as our approach to multilateral netting and the in/out swap tool which delivers capital and liquidity efficiencies. Settlement members who use both solutions only fund around 1%<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of the total value of their payment instructions on a typical day, enabling cash flow to be available for other business operations like trading, sales and business growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Jacco Keijzer, Head of Global Markets, ABN AMRO&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Mitigating FX settlement risk has always been a priority for ABN AMRO. As a long-standing participant in CLSSettlement, we recognize the value it brings to our operations while supporting our adherence to global best practices. Becoming a settlement member reflects our dedication to creating a more robust and efficient FX ecosystem, while ensuring our FX operations uphold the highest standards of operational efficiency and risk mitigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Principle 35 states:&nbsp;<span>Where practicable, Market Participants should eliminate Settlement Risk, for example by using settlement services that provide PvP settlement. Where Settlement Risk cannot be eliminated, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their Settlement Risk as much as practicable. The netting of FX settlement obligations (in particular the use of automated netting systems) is encouraged.</span></li>
<li>Settlement members fund only around 1% of the total value of their payment instructions on a typical day.</li>

<title>IOSCO Announces Themes For Its 9th Edition Of World Investor Week (WIW) To Be Held Between 6-12 October 2025 - WIW 2025 To Focus On Technology And Digital Finance, Artificial Intelligence And Fraud &amp; Scam Prevention</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-announces-themes-for-its-9th-edition-of-world-investor-week-wiw-to-be-he-2025616/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-announces-themes-for-its-9th-edition-of-world-investor-week-wiw-to-be-he-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s World Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long, global campaign to raise awareness of the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.</p>
<p>Kicking off on 6 October 2025, and with the support of the G20 Presidency, WIW2025 will bring together organizations from over 100 jurisdictions to drive awareness around trending issues which impact investors around the world.</p>
<p>Principal themes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technology and Digital Finance 
<ul>
<li>New technologies use algorithms that may not consider the personal risk tolerance of the investor; imitative trading or fractional trading are not a substitute for portfolio diversification and the preparedness for unforeseen events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
<ul>
<li>AI tools can enhance financial services but there are many associated risks which investors need to be aware of, including the exploitation of personal data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fraud &amp; Scam Prevention 
<ul>
<li>Fraudsters are sophisticated; they actively exploit investor trends for their own financial gain and lure unsuspecting investors into scams ranging from phishing to pig butchering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These themes align with IOSCO&rsquo;s Roadmap for Retail Investor Online Safety and will be complemented with discussions and activity on Crypto Assets and Basics of Investing.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldinvestorweek.org%2Fresources%2FWIW2024-Public-Report.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C611077c10bcf4a4bb62a08ddacb3537f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638856608392462574%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=OOfAoA9ebvrGJzUB%2F%2B2nrDolWwb2aRQy7OPWsXSXdew%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">World Investor Week</a>&nbsp;saw the involvement of 132 entities across 118 jurisdictions and reached millions of individuals. Activities were often supplemented at a national level by a range of industry and educational organizations, including local schools and universities.</p>
<p>IOSCO Board Chairman&nbsp;<strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, who also serves as Chair of the Belgium Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Investor Protection is an important cornerstone of IOSCO&rsquo;s work. Just recently, the Board approved several publications which address how technology is influencing retail investment decisions, including tips to online investors on how to stay clear of associated risks. This year&rsquo;s WIW will help keep the spotlight on these discussions. I am grateful to all our members and partner organizations for their continued support.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;<strong>Camille Beaudoin</strong>, Director, Financial Education Expertise and Partnerships, AMF Quebec and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee leading this year&rsquo;s campaign, added:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We were pleased to have had such incredible engagement last year; the range and scope of activities offered by members was gratifying and impressive. The beauty of our WIW campaign is that it can be perfectly adapted to meet the needs of local jurisdictions and this keeps it relevant for everyone.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As in previous years, WIW2025 will be supported by a number of partner organizations including the Financial Planning Standards Board&rsquo;s (FPSB) bespoke &lsquo;World Financial Planning Day&rsquo; - which will take place on Wednesday 8 October &ndash; and the World Federation of Exchanges who encourage members to &lsquo;Ring the Bell&rsquo; for WIW2025.</p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges Releases Global Guidance On Managing Transitions To T+1 Settlement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and central counterparties (CCPs), has published industry-wide guidance on the complex mix of operational, regulatory, and strategic considerations for shortening securities settlement cycles.<br /><br />The paper draws on lessons learned from recent transitions in markets including India, the United States, Canada, and Latin America, and offers a roadmap for jurisdictions seeking to move safely and efficiently from T+2 to T+1 settlement.&nbsp;<br /><br />In publishing the guidance, the WFE emphasises the importance of thorough industry collaboration, operational readiness, and technological investment to ensure successful implementation and warns against premature moves beyond T+1 without clear justification and market preparedness.<br /><br />The guidance identifies seven key imperatives for a successful transition to T+1:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Operational Preparedness:</strong>&nbsp;Firms that invest early in technology, automation, and testing face fewer disruptions during transition. Proactive preparation is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong>&nbsp;Close coordination between regulators and industry participants is vital. Standardised protocols and open communication help ensure consistent timelines and processes, while ongoing communication between stakeholders ensures rapid resolution of emerging issues.</li>
<li><strong>Technology &amp; Automation:</strong>&nbsp;Straight-Through Processing and real-time data reconciliation are critical enablers of accelerated settlement, removing bottlenecks caused by manual interventions.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidity Management:</strong>&nbsp;T+1 impacts cash and securities availability. Enhanced cash forecasting and continuous monitoring are needed to avoid settlement failures.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Alignment:</strong>&nbsp;Clear guidance, realistic timelines, and regulatory flexibility combined with phased rollouts and pilot programs, have proven successful in allowing firms to adapt progressively, while clear protocols for handling exceptions and fails helps to minimise systemic risks during the transition period.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Considerations:&nbsp;</strong>Upgrading infrastructure carries significant costs, especially for smaller firms and CCPs. Careful planning is needed to ensure benefits outweigh expenses, and rushed transitions will be more expensive than methodical ones, as well as being less risky in terms of project completion.</li>
<li><strong>Global Implications:&nbsp;</strong>Misaligned settlement cycles and time zone differences create challenges for cross-border trades, related FX transactions, and instruments like ETFs.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the WFE,</strong>&nbsp;commented, &ldquo;We urge regulators and market participants to engage in structured, phased transitions supported by clear roadmaps, robust cost-benefit analysis, and inclusive governance structures.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE, commented,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;It is vital to look at T+1 as a cost-benefit question. The powerful effect of multilateral netting, which can only be achieved through centralised market infrastructure, has clear advantages.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="ltr"><span>We are proud to announce that Julia Streets, the Founder and CEO of Streets Consulting, the FinTech growth consultancy and a widely recognised champion of UK FinTech entrepreneurship and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I), has been awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in HM The King's 2025 Birthday Honours List for Services to Diversity and Inclusion in Entrepreneurship, particularly in the Financial Services and Technology Sectors</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The award acknowledges&nbsp;</span><span>Julia&rsquo;s impactful career to date as a successful entrepreneur&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span>nd her dedication to driving growth, shaping debate and influencing change across the financial services and technology sectors</span><span>. She has founded and built a successful business advising a wide range of domestic and international startups, scaleups, global organisations, and industry bodies, helping them grow, transform and bring their innovative technologies to market. A passionate supporter of the national FinTech initiatives right across the UK, Julia is a vocal champion of the UK FinTech industry on national and international stages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Beyond her business achievements,&nbsp;</span><span>Julia is a passionate DE&amp;I advocate, dedicating significant time, energy and experience towards promoting DE&amp;I initiatives.</span><span>&nbsp;She founded, funded and hosted the world&rsquo;s first financial services DE&amp;I podcast, "</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/divercity-podcast-talking-diversity-and-inclusion-in/id1288206698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>DiverCity Podcast</span></a><span>," listed as one of the most influential DE&amp;I podcasts globally, year after year. Running for 16 seasons with listeners in 50+ countries, DiverCity podcast shone a light on positive progress, called out areas for further focus and offered lots of ideas for practical change. Julia interviewed industry heavyweights, including the Governor of the Bank of England, the President of the CBI, the Founder of WeAreTheCity and WeAreTechWomen, and leaders from the 30% Club and Diversity Project (to name but a few). She and her team actively sought out lesser-heard individual and community voices, such as Sikhs in the City, Young Muslim Women&rsquo;s Network, LGBT Great, TalkAboutBlack, the Business Disability Forum and many more. As a result, many financial institutions call upon Julia to speak at and chair think tanks and roundtable discussions to drive meaningful, sustainable change for DE&amp;I initiatives.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Known for her infectious energy on some of the industry&rsquo;s largest stages</span><span>&nbsp;and in the smallest of rooms, she is a much sought-after speaker, conference chair and show host who perfectly blends her business and industry expertise with her stand-up comedy stagecraft to shape debates and deliver engaging insight to audiences worldwide.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Julia Streets, MBE, said: &ldquo;</span><span>I am incredibly honoured and humbled to have been awarded an MBE in HM The&nbsp; King&rsquo;s Birthday Honours List for services to diversity and inclusion in entrepreneurship, particularly in the financial services and technology sectors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As an entrepreneur, fintech obsessive, mentor and coach, I am deeply passionate about driving businesses forward, shaping industry debate and creating a more inclusive financial services ecosystem.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Diversity, equity and inclusion matter now more than ever before. I, like many others, can quote statistic after statistic about the commercial and societal value of truly diverse organisations. In today&rsquo;s climate, while organisations may well fly a little lower under the radar, enlightened leaders of our time know that what they DO right now will have a huge impact on how they attract and retain the brightest and best talent, both today and tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There is still much work to be done to ensure that all voices are heard and represented, and I am committed to continuing these efforts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>I would also like to recognise the hard work, dedication and passion of my incredibly talented team. They deserve this as much as I do, I simply couldn&rsquo;t make an impact without them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A former stand-up comedian, Julia uses her platform and stage presence to great effect. However,&nbsp;</span><span>her&nbsp;</span><span>work extends far beyond the public stage. As a&nbsp;</span><span>senior leadership and life transformation coach</span><span>, Julia works quietly behind the scenes, coaching founders and senior executives, supporting their growth and helping them stay fit for the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Julia has won many awards for her work and has been named one of 30 Women on Boards, 30 Women Entrepreneurs and 30 Inspirational Women by Brummell Magazine and twice listed as one of 20 Global Diversity Champions in the Global Diversity List. She is a fellow of the British American Project, a former trustee and staunch supporter of Street Child - fast becoming the preferred charity of the London FinTech community - and is a member of the PowerWomen Network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She is recognised as a person of influence, invited to lend her voice, experience and insight, inspiring others to lean in, step up and be part of the change that we need to see.</span></p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span>Background:</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Julia Streets is the Founder and CEO of Streets Consulting,&nbsp;</span><span>the FinTech growth consultancy that designs and delivers business development and integrated marketing communication strategies to help financial services and technology organisations with their growth and transformation journeys.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She and her team advise a wide range of financial services and technology startups and scaleups,&nbsp; global organisations, key industry bodies and technology incubators. We are proud to be recommended to new clients by boards and investors, industry influencers, media and existing clients.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Prior to becoming a founder &amp; CEO, Julia was global head of communications at Atos Euronext Market Solutions, serving on the Executive Committee and European head of marketing and sales development at Instinet Europe. She earned her pinstripes in the 1990s at the WPP firm, Hill and Knowlton, and a small city agency where she was head of ecommerce during the dotcom boom.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A senior leadership and life transformation coach, she works with senior executives and is an advisor, mentor and investor. She is called upon to chair many of the world&rsquo;s leading conferences, drawing not only on her industry experience, but also on her skills as a speaker, host and former sell-out stand-up comedian.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Julia has received many awards and accolades, including being listed as one of Brummell Magazine&rsquo;s 30 Women on Boards, 30 Women Entrepreneurs, and 30 Inspirational Women. She has been named one of the Global Diversity List&rsquo;s 20 Global Champions and is regularly called out as a trailblazer and changemaker.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Euronext and Clearstream start a new partnership to advance the continued development of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s collateral management services across repo and other asset classes. The additional collaboration with Clearstream strengthens Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s infrastructure to deliver scalable and efficient clearing solutions tailored to the evolving requirements of European and international market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of this initiative, Clearstream will serve as a triparty agent (TPA) for Euronext Clearing, facilitating advanced collateral management capabilities. Clients will benefit from automated, flexible and operationally streamlined solutions that enhance margin and balance sheet optimisation. Clearstream will act as an independent third party, handling the collateral selection, valuation and substitution to ensure compliance with eligibility criteria while minimising operational complexities. In addition, Clearstream will manage settlement and custody services, provide robust regulatory reporting, and support liquidity and risk management objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The go-live of this enhanced service offering is scheduled for November 2025.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Integrated post-trade infrastructure to strengthen European capital markets&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partnership aligns with Euronext&rsquo;s and Clearstream&rsquo;s ambitions to strengthen European capital markets by providing robust, scalable and efficient pan-European post-trade infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It represents a significant milestone in Euronext&rsquo;s strategy to expand its 25-year strong&nbsp; repo clearing franchise into a unified, pan-European clearing model delivering greater efficiency and value to clients across the continent and beyond. The agreement supports the upcoming launch of the initial phase of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s Repo Expansion Initiative, the Repo Foundation, scheduled for June 2025 &mdash;opening access to international participants and introducing broader product capabilities. Over the past three years, Euronext Clearing has transformed from a national central counterparty into the third-largest European clearing house, integrating operations across multiple countries, markets, and asset classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearstream adds its 30-years expertise in supporting market participants worldwide to efficiently manage and mobilize their collateral assets in changing market environments. In a strategic initiative, the post-trade service provider has consecutively enhanced its collateral management, lending and liquidity services, connecting with central counterparties (CCPs), exchange providers, and other central securities depositories (CSDs) to maximize much-needed liquidity at global markets.&nbsp; Clearstream&rsquo;s innovative data and digital collateral solutions complete the joint offering, supporting Euronext Clearing with AI-based collateral schedule creation and liquidity optimisation data insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anthony Attia, Global Head of Derivatives and Post-Trade at Euronext, said: &ldquo;This collaboration with Clearstream marks an important step in the execution of our &lsquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rsquo; strategy, reinforcing Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s ability to deliver cutting-edge collateral and clearing solutions. As we prepare to launch the Repo Foundation in June 2025, this alliance supports the broader expansion of our repo clearing services across Europe. By working with Clearstream, we are scaling our infrastructure, enhancing collateral mobility, and building a more resilient, client-focused clearing ecosystem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sam Riley, CEO at Clearstream Securities Services, said: &ldquo;As financial markets become more unpredictable, demanding greater speed and efficiency, we stay committed to empowering our clients with reliable and scalable state-of-the-art solutions. We are delighted to partner with Euronext Clearing to deliver innovative collateral management solutions that enhance market efficiency and support sustainable growth. This collaboration reflects our commitment to building a stronger and more accessible European capital market that is well-equipped to navigate the complexities of the financial landscape of today and tomorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>ASX Statement On ASIC Commencing Inquiry</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-statement-on-asic-commencing-inquiry-2025616/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-statement-on-asic-commencing-inquiry-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX today acknowledges the decision of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to commence a compliance assessment and inquiry into the obligations of ASX&rsquo;s market licensees and clearing and settlement licensees under ss794C and 823C of the Corporations Act. To support the assessment, ASIC will appoint an expert panel to examine the frameworks and practices within the ASX Group in relation to governance, capability and risk management.</p>
<p><b>ASX Chairman David Clarke said</b>: &ldquo;We acknowledge the seriousness of this action, and ASIC&rsquo;s inquiry will have our full cooperation. We have been working hard on a transformation strategy with several of the initiatives designed to strengthen culture and capabilities, operational risk management, business resilience and technology resilience, but we acknowledge there have been incidents that have damaged trust in ASX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome the opportunity for independent parties to review the work underway and advise on what more we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of its five-year strategy announced in 2023, ASX reset its capital management settings to allow for significant investment into its technology modernisation program. As well as the delivery of the project to replace CHESS, this includes upgrades to the cash market trading platform, the replacement of the derivatives trading and clearing platforms and the upgrade to telecommunications networks that provide participants with access to ASX systems.</p>
<p><b>ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse said</b>: &ldquo;As the operator of critical market infrastructure&nbsp; we recognise the significance of this action by ASIC and we are committed to supporting the inquiry. This is a wideranging inquiry and it will provide an independent and transparent view of the work we have done, and the work we still have to do. It will be critical to ensuring our stakeholders can have trust and confidence in ASX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each person at ASX understands the key role we play in the financial system and we will provide all the support required to ensure this inquiry is effective.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC has informed ASX that in light of these broader actions, it has decided to discontinue its investigation into the December 2024 CHESS Batch Settlement Incident. ASIC stated that consideration of this incident will form part of the broader inquiry. Further information can be found in <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-103mr-asic-launches-inquiry-into-asx/">ASIC&rsquo;s </a><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-103mr-asic-launches-inquiry-into-asx/">statement</a><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-103mr-asic-launches-inquiry-into-asx/">.</a></p>
<p>ASX provided financial guidance ranges at its Investor Forum on Thursday 12 June for total expense growth for FY26 and capital expenditure for FY26 and FY27. As ASX received notification from ASIC of this action after market close on Friday 13 June, that guidance does not specifically factor in the costs that ASX may incur in responding to, and supporting, the compliance assessment and inquiry, which ASX is currently considering. Should an update to that guidance be required, ASX would keep the market informed in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<title>ASIC Launches Inquiry Into ASX</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-launches-inquiry-into-asx-2025616/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-launches-inquiry-into-asx-2025616/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC today announced an Inquiry into Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) group, focusing on governance, capability and risk management frameworks and practices across the group.</p>
<p>ASX plays a critical role in Australia&rsquo;s financial markets. ASIC and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have ongoing concerns over ASX&rsquo;s ability to maintain stable, secure and resilient critical market infrastructure.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Inquiry will be led by an expert panel that will make recommendations to address any identified shortcomings or deficiencies. ASIC will publish a report of the outcome of the Inquiry, which will inform the next steps it may take.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;ASX operates Australia&rsquo;s critical markets infrastructure. Investors and market participants deserve to have absolute confidence that ASX is operating soundly, securely and effectively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s decision to initiate an Inquiry follows repeated and serious failures at ASX.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASX is ubiquitous, you simply cannot buy and settle on the Australian public equities and futures markets without relying on ASX and its systems.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Inquiry provides an opportunity for ASX to bolster market trust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Chairs of the ASX entities, members of the Board, and CEO and CRO have assured me ASX will fully cooperate with the Inquiry and ASIC welcomes this cooperation,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>ASIC will discontinue its investigation of the 20 December 2024 CHESS Batch Settlement failure. Consideration of this incident will form part of the broader Inquiry.</p>
<p>While this Inquiry is underway, it is critical ASX continues to prioritise the safe and efficient operation of its infrastructure, including progress towards Release 1 of the CHESS replacement project in mid-2026.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC will conduct the Inquiry using existing powers under Section 794C and 823C of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;to assess how well ASX is complying with its obligations as a market licensee and a Clearing and Settlement facility licensee.</p>
<p>The Inquiry may also use the additional powers received through the&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Act 2024</em>.</p>
<p>The Inquiry panel will be asked to examine the frameworks and practices in relation to governance, capability, and risk management within ASX group.</p>
<p>The composition of the expert panel will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The panel will be supported by an ASIC Secretariat, which is expected to include secondees from RBA, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as well as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p>
<p>Full details can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/0zncyxvj/25-103mr-australian-securities-exchange-asx-group-inquiry-terms-of-reference.pdf" title="25 103MR Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Group Inquiry Terms Of Reference">Inquiry&rsquo;s Terms of Reference</a>.</p>
<p>The RBA and ASIC are co-regulators of licensed Clearing and Settlement (CS) facilities and have separate, but complementary, responsibilities for the licensing and supervision of CS facilities licensees.</p>
<p>In March 2025, in a joint letter to the ASX, ASIC and RBA expressed increasing concern over the management of operational risk, following the CHESS batch settlement failure incident that occurred on 20 Dec. The expert technical review of CHESS, that ASIC announced on 31 March, will continue alongside the Inquiry.</p>

<title>A New Lens On Regulation: The Modern Regulator Launches To Track The Evolving Landscape Of Regulation Across Australia, New Zealand, The UK And Beyond</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>The Modern Regulator</i>&nbsp;is a new digital publication dedicated to examining the changing nature of regulation and the people, processes, and technologies shaping it. With a primary focus on Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, the publication offers nuanced, expert-driven coverage of regulatory issues while also tracking developments and best practices globally.</p>
<p>Developed by a team with deep experience in regulation, public policy, journalism, and technology,&nbsp;<i>The Modern Regulator</i>&nbsp;was founded on a shared commitment to telling meaningful stories about how regulation works in practice. It looks beyond legislation to examine how rules are interpreted, implemented, and adapted amid evolving public expectations, political priorities, and technological change.</p>
<p>"While technology for regulation is advancing rapidly, the heart of regulation still lies in people and their actions within the broader context," said Kirsty Dusting, Global Vice President, Regulatory Solutions, Objective Corporation. "We aim to tell the story of regulation in motion through the tools, decisions, and pressures that shape it, not just the headlines that occasionally surface it."</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on vendors or products,&nbsp;<i>The Modern Regulator</i>&nbsp;explores trends, practices, data, and outcomes that redefine how regulation is delivered and experienced. Its editorial scope includes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Ongoing regulatory news from Australia, New Zealand, and the UK</li>
<li>In-depth features on cross-cutting themes and sector-specific developments</li>
<li>Coverage of intersections between regulation and digital identity, cybersecurity, automation, AI and more</li>
<li>Policy analysis focused on the public aims of regulation and how they are achieved</li>
<li>Guest contributions from professionals working in and around the regulatory space</li>
</ul>
<p>"Good regulation is adaptive. It responds not only to technology, but to changing expectations, institutional realities, and new ways of solving problems," said Kirsty. "We want to shine a light on the thinkers and practitioners pushing regulation forward, often in ways that go unnoticed."</p>
<p>Behind the publication is a team with decades of combined experience in journalism, technology, public policy, and government.&nbsp;<i>The Modern Regulator</i>&nbsp;was launched to meet a growing need for informed, independent commentary at the intersection of regulation, digital transformation, and public service.</p>
<p>Published by Objective Corporation,&nbsp;<i>The Modern Regulator</i>&nbsp;operates with editorial independence and focuses on thoughtful, non-partisan coverage.</p>

<title>NGX Group, Nigeria Securities And Exchange Commission Pursue Capital Market Diplomacy To Deepen Nigeria-China Financial Ties</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-group-nigeria-securities-and-exchange-commission-pursue-capital-market-dipl-2025615/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a strategic move to position Nigeria&rsquo;s capital market as a catalyst for cross-border investments, Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have reaffirmed their commitment to fostering cross-border capital market partnerships. Their current engagements in China reflect a broader drive to strengthen Nigeria&rsquo;s connectivity to global financial markets and attract new investment flows.</p>
<p>This commitment was demonstrated at the China-Africa CEO Dialogue, organised by Choice International Group in strategic collaboration with NGX Group. The event took place on the sidelines of the 4th China&ndash;Africa Economic and Trade Expo in Changsha, where NGX Group, SEC, and other leading African institutions engaged Chinese corporates, regulators, and financial institutions to explore mutually beneficial partnerships.</p>
<p>Speaking at the dialogue, Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director / CEO, NGX Group, noted that deepening capital market partnerships is key to unlocking new investment corridors between Nigeria and China. He highlighted NGX Group&rsquo;s engagement with institutions such as the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange, aimed at creating pathways for Chinese corporates to raise capital locally, whether through bonds, commercial papers, or equity, to help mitigate currency and operational risks while driving growth in key sectors like manufacturing, ICT, and automotive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial flows are often the missing link in many China-Africa engagements,&rdquo; Popoola said. &ldquo;By opening these corridors, we are positioning Nigeria as a hub for cross-border investments and supporting the country&rsquo;s economic diversification agenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a regulatory perspective, Dr. Emomotimi Agama, Director-General of SEC, reaffirmed Nigeria&rsquo;s commitment to providing a safe, transparent, and enabling investment environment. &ldquo;Our job is not just to provide the framework, but to assure investors that if they come to Nigeria, they&rsquo;ll find justice when they need it. Transparency and credibility are key to building investor confidence. While risk is inherent in every business, our role as regulators is to mitigate those risks and ensure a level playing field,&rdquo; he stated.</p>
<p>Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman, NGX Group, praised the strategic engagements in China as a testament to NGX Group&rsquo;s ambition to position Nigeria as Africa&rsquo;s investment gateway. &ldquo;At NGX Group, we believe the capital market is pivotal to unlocking Africa&rsquo;s potential. Our engagement in China reflects our commitment to building bridges between Nigeria and key global markets to deliver long-term prosperity for our stakeholders,&rdquo; Kwairanga remarked.</p>
<p>The dialogue underscored the importance of capital markets in facilitating trade, technology transfer, and industrial development between China and Nigeria. Both NGX Group and SEC pledged to continue championing capital market diplomacy as a tool for sustainable economic growth.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced that results from its annual bank stress test will be released on Friday, June 27, at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Additionally, today the Board published its annual stress test methodology document, which provides details about the models used in the stress test.</p>
<p>The Board's stress test is one tool used to measure whether banks have adequate capital to absorb losses so that they can lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. It evaluates banks' resilience by estimating losses, net revenue, and capital levels&mdash;which provide a cushion against losses&mdash;under a hypothetical recession scenario.</p>
<p>This year, 22 large banks were subject to the Board's stress test. The scenario includes a severe global recession with heightened stress in both commercial and residential real estate markets, as well as in corporate debt markets.</p>

<title>SIFMA Welcomes Bill To Prevent Misapplication Of SEC Rule 15c2-11 To Fixed Income Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-welcomes-bill-to-prevent-misapplication-of-sec-rule-15c2-11-to-fixed-incom-2025613/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from Chris Killian, managing director, corporate credit and securitization, on the introduction of legislation which would exempt fixed-income securities from equity-based Rule 15c2-11:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA appreciates the introduction of the &lsquo;Protecting Private Job Creators Act&rsquo; by Representatives Troy Downing (R-MT) and Cleo Fields (D-LA).&nbsp; We strongly support this legislation because it would ensure that the equity-specific Rule 15c2-11 is not wrongly applied to fixed-income markets.&nbsp; In 2021, the SEC without notice reversed 50 years of regulatory practice and applied the Rule to fixed income securities, when the Rule had never been designed for them.&nbsp; This sudden action has had significant negative effects on fixed income market participants and has necessitated a series of relief issuances by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to avoid greater calamity, but those steps have only partially mitigated the impact of inappropriate application of this rule.&nbsp; There are significant differences between trading in the equity and the fixed income markets which must be recognized in the regulatory framework.&nbsp; If a similar rule to 15c2-11 is to be applied to fixed-income markets in the future, which we do not believe is warranted, it can only be done through a public notice-and-comment process focused specifically on the fixed-income markets.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Issues Warning About Scams Targeting Seniors, Issues Tip Sheet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To help raise awareness of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), is issuing a warning&mdash;scams are on the rise, including scams that target seniors.</p>
<p>CIRO enforcement data reveals that approximately 30% of all CIRO case assessment files involve seniors. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/8526/download?inline" target="_self" title="Investor Survey">CIRO&rsquo;s 2024 Investor Survey</a>, approximately one in five Canadians have been approached with a possible investment fraud. Most of those Canadians were approached through unsolicited, spam emails, texts or calls from strangers, or messages on social media.</p>
<p>To avoid being fooled by fraud and scams targeting seniors, CIRO&rsquo;s Office of the Investor offers the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>When receiving text messages, emails, or direct messages on social platforms from unknown contacts, STOP and THINK before you CLICK!</li>
<li>Keep your financial and personal information in a safe place and protect the information, keeping it private;</li>
<li>Get legal advice before signing documents that involve major decisions involving your home or other assets;</li>
<li>Be cautious about opening a joint bank account as the other person / people can withdraw funds without asking;</li>
<li>Keep records of any money you give away- noting whether it is a loan or a gift;</li>
<li>Have a Power of Attorney. Choose someone you trust to look after you, so that if you are ill or unable to look after yourself, your finances will be protected from others who may try to take advantage;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ciro.ca/office-investor/avoiding-fraud-and-protecting-your-investments/why-you-should-consider-appointing-trusted-contact-person" target="_self" title="Why You Should Consider Appointing a Trusted Contact Person">Name a Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;with your financial advisor. In specific circumstances, this allows your advisor to contact the individual about concerns related to your mental capacity and financial well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p>CIRO&rsquo;s Office of the Investor works to build financial literacy and help Canadians avoid scams and fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People often report feeling shame following a scam, but it is important to communicate quickly with your financial services provider if you believe you have been a victim,&rdquo; said Alex Williams, Senior Vice-President, Strategy, Innovation and Stakeholder Protection at CIRO. &ldquo;Victims are often retargeted in what is called a recovery scam&mdash;whereby perpetrators claim to assist the victim, only to defraud them again. Getting ahead of scams by communicating with the right agents quickly if you suspect you&rsquo;ve been scammed can make all the difference in protecting your assets.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Encourage Canadians To Look Out For Deceptive Social Media Investment Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In recognition of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD) on June 15, 2025, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is encouraging Canadians to connect with older adults in their lives to talk about the growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) and social media investment scams targeting seniors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Older Canadians are often the target of financial scams and, more recently, fraudsters have been using AI to make the ads appear legitimate,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission and Chair of the CSA. &ldquo;By asking questions and starting important conversations about the warning signs of scams, we can help support the financial wellbeing of the seniors in our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Scams leverage AI to create seemingly credible ads and online profiles</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Scam artists commonly target older Canadians with fake investment opportunities online. Taking advantage of advertising channels through social media platforms, and the openness of people to new relationships fostered through dating or friendship apps, fraudsters can easily and quickly create online personas to deceive and manipulate potential victims with realistic-looking investment opportunities.</p>
<p>The CSA urges older Canadians and their loved ones to remember the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid investment opportunities promoted online, especially those seemingly endorsed by celebrities or political figures or those that advertise lucrative, easy or quick returns. Imagery, video and voices can be easily generated with AI to look and sound real.</li>
<li>Be cautious of online investing groups claiming to be run by investment professionals. Fraudsters will commonly direct potential victims to move their communications to chat groups created on WhatsApp, Telegram and Discord to keep conversations private and harder to trace.</li>
<li>Be mindful of any new online connection, acquaintance or perceived love interest who asks probing questions about your finances or plays off your anxieties or fears when offering you an unrequested investment opportunity.</li>
<li>All investment firms and their advisors in Canada are required to ask each of their clients to name a Trusted Contact Person (TCP). Sharing the name of someone you consider to be a trusted contact can help protect your accounts and give you peace of mind.</li>
<li>Any individual or firm offering you investments needs to be registered with provincial or territorial securities regulators. You can check registration at AreTheyRegistered.ca, but remember that images, voice calls and video meetings can be AI manipulated. It is strongly advised that you do not send money to anyone you have not met in person or whose identity you cannot confidently validate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Foster awareness and digital literacy</strong></p>
<p>AI continues to evolve rapidly, and so do the scams that use this technology. To safeguard your financial accounts and empower yourself and those you care for, the CSA recommends taking time to learn how AI is being used across the digital landscape for investing purposes.</p>
<p>The CSA has a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/avoiding-fraud/financial-abuse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investor tools and resources available online</a>&nbsp;to help Canadians become more informed investors. Investors can follow&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/csa_news?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@CSA_News</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSA.ACVM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@CSA.ACVM</a>&nbsp;on Facebook and subscribe to the CSA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-alerts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Investor Alerts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Suspect you or someone you know is a victim of an investment scam?</strong></p>
<p>If you feel like you or someone you know has been approached or is a victim of fraudulent investment, contact&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your local securities regulator</a>.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>BIS: Basel Committee Publishes Framework For Voluntary Disclosure Of Climate-Related Financial Risks</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bis-basel-committee-publishes-framework-for-voluntary-disclosure-of-climate-rel-2025613/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bis-basel-committee-publishes-framework-for-voluntary-disclosure-of-climate-rel-2025613/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The Basel Committee has published a voluntary framework for disclosing climate-related financial risks for jurisdictions to consider.</li>
<li>The framework incorporates flexibility to account for evolving climate-related data.</li>
<li>The Committee will monitor relevant developments, including implementation of other reporting frameworks and disclosure practices by internationally active banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has published today its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d597.htm"><span class="firstword">voluntary</span>&nbsp;framework for the disclosure of climate-related financial risks</a>, which includes both qualitative and quantitative information. The Committee has agreed this framework will be voluntary in nature, with jurisdictions to consider whether to implement it domestically.</p>
<p>The Committee acknowledges that the accuracy, consistency and quality of climate-related data are evolving, and therefore it is necessary to incorporate a reasonable level of flexibility into the final framework. The Committee also recognises that multiple quantitative metrics and qualitative information may be needed to form a comprehensive picture of banks' exposure to climate-related financial risks. Users need to consider the disclosures holistically, understanding the strengths and shortcomings of the disclosed information.</p>
<p>The Committee will monitor relevant developments, including implementation of other reporting frameworks and disclosure practices by internationally active banks in member jurisdictions, and consider whether any revisions to the framework would be warranted in future.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>Finansinspektionen’s View On More Flexible Rules For Calculating Capital Requirements For Credit Risk</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionens-view-on-more-flexible-rules-for-calculating-capital-require-2025613/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionens-view-on-more-flexible-rules-for-calculating-capital-require-2025613/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Finansinspektionen has published a memorandum clarifying its expectations on banks&rsquo; application of internal models to calculate capital requirements for credit risk. FI&rsquo;s position is based on its experiences from previously performed model assessments and considering the greater flexibility that was introduced on 1 January of this year through amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3).</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>The implementation of CRR3 entails in part that banks currently applying internal credit risk models are given more flexibility to apply different methods for calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk.</p>
<p>Over time, it has become apparent that the quality of the model applications FI has received has not been sufficient under current regulations. This can be a result of some types of exposures being particularly difficult to model. Given these challenges, FI views positively that the implementation of CRR3 allows banks greater possibilities for adapting their model creation to the conditions of each portfolio. At the same time, the regulatory framework is clear that a return to less advanced methods is not driven by regulatory arbitrage. The increased flexibility aims instead to allow for a more proportionate and risk-adapted application of internal models. In this way, resources and focus can target the portfolios where models are judged to reliably reflect risk. In this context, FI would like to underline that there will still be strict demands on quality and robust risk management, regardless of the method chosen.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Kurt Hohl, with nearly 40 years of accounting and auditing experience, has been named Chief Accountant, effective July 7, 2025. Acting Chief Accountant Ryan Wolfe will return to his role as Chief Accountant in the Division of Enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kurt is an experienced accountant with deeply technical knowledge and international experience, and we are lucky he has decided to return to the SEC,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;This is an important role. Given that I served with Kurt previously, I know firsthand that his integrity, along with his skills, will benefit our markets and investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Ryan for his service as Acting Chief Accountant and am pleased that he will continue serving in the Division of Enforcement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hohl most recently founded Corallium Advisors, which helps businesses navigate the complexities of auditing, regulatory compliance, risk management, and initial public offerings. Before that, he spent 26 years as a partner at Ernst &amp; Young (EY) in a variety of roles. His final EY role was as global deputy vice-chair of EY&rsquo;s Global Assurance Professional Practice. In that role he was responsible for the operation and oversight of the technical, regulatory, risk, and quality oversight functions of EY&rsquo;s global professional practice organization -- a team of more than 1,400 professionals. Mr. Hohl previously served at the SEC from 1989 to 1997, rising to Associate Chief Accountant in the Division of Corporation Finance. There he authored what became the Financial Reporting Manual, a primary guide for the SEC accounting staff and practitioners in the application of the federal securities laws. He began his professional career at Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells.</p>
<p>Mr. Hohl received a B.B.S. in accounting from James Madison University and is a certified public accountant in Virginia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to come back to the SEC along with Chairman Atkins,&rdquo; said Mr. Hohl. "This is a pivotal time for our capital markets, and I look forward to working with the dedicated public servants in the Office of the Chief Accountant to advance accounting and auditing policies that reinforce investor confidence, enhance transparency, and support innovation."</p>
<p>Mr. Wolfe has served as Acting Chief Accountant since January 2025. He concurrently has been serving as Chief Accountant of the Division of Enforcement and has previously served as Senior Associate Chief Accountant in the Office of the Chief Accountant.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that investment management industry leader Brian T. Daly will become the new Director of the Division of Investment Management, effective July 8.</p>
<p>Mr. Daly brings decades of experience serving in prominent roles at global law firms and investment management firms while advising fund managers and sponsors on regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>For the past four years, he has been a partner in the investment management practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP in New York, where he has guided investment advisers and other clients on their legal and compliance programs, policies, and procedures as well as counseling on fund and management company formation, operational and trading issues, contentious matters, and management company transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian has deep familiarity with all levels of the investment management industry, and I look forward to working with him as we address smart, effective oversight of the industry and its relationships with investors,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;I am looking forward to working with Brian on common-sense regulation that does not impose unnecessary burdens and genuinely embraces the public comment process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Daly said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long respected and appreciated the SEC&rsquo;s commitment to regulatory oversight while advising clients on compliance and providing public comment from the investment management point of view during agency rulemaking. I am optimistic about this new day at the SEC and eager to get to work with Chairman Atkins and my new colleagues to ensure regulatory compliance by investment advisers and fund managers while tailoring rulemakings within our statutory authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior to Akin, Mr. Daly spent nearly a decade as a partner in the investment management group of Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel LLP, advising investment advisers and fund managers on legal, compliance, and operational issues and matters.&nbsp;He was also a founding equity partner of Kepos Capital, a quantitative investment management company, while he served as chief legal and compliance officer. Among other prior positions, Mr. Daly served in general counsel and chief compliance officer positions at Millennium Partners, a Carlyle Group liquid markets fund manager, and Raptor Capital Management. He also taught legal ethics at Yale Law School and served on the board of directors of the Managed Funds Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Daly earned his J.D., with distinction, from Stanford Law School, where he was an associate editor on the Stanford Law Review and the editor-in-chief of the Stanford Journal of International Law. He received his B.A., magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, from Catholic University and his M.A. from the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii.</p>

<title>Statement On The UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Commitment To Growth</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-uk-financial-conduct-authoritys-commitment-to-growth-2025613/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are fully committed to supporting economic growth in the UK and a thriving financial services sector. That's why we have made it easier for companies to list, supported greater home ownership, set out a roadmap for crypto regulation, and are reimagining financial advice and guidance to boost investments.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;ve begun stripping out data requests, retired outdated supervisory documents, introduced a new private stock market, pared back our insurance rulebook and are working on redress reforms to give consumers and firms greater certainty.</p>
<p>We have put growth at the heart of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-strategy-2025-2030" title="Our strategy 2025 to 2030">five-year strategy</a>, set out a vision for more informed risk-taking, a debate we have spearheaded over recent years, and committed to being more predictable and proportionate.</p>
<p>We agree that there is more to do to understand the role of regulation in unlocking growth in the wider economy and that's why we have commissioned research on this topic.</p>
<p>The UK is the largest net exporter of financial services in the world and London is the world's second largest financial services centre, closing the gap on New York. We should capitalise on those strengths by working together across Government, Parliament, industry, and society more broadly, to seize the opportunities ahead.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll carefully consider the Lords Financial Services Regulation committee&rsquo;s recommendations and look forward to responding.</p>

It aims to help national energy regulators conduct the benchmarking required by the network code.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is this benchmarking important?</span></p>
<p>Conducting benchmarking of cybersecurity investments will provide national regulatory authorities with an overview of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the costs of implementing cybersecurity controls, as well as their effectiveness and efficiency;</li>
<li>prices of cybersecurity services, systems and products;</li>
<li>the level of comparability of costs and functions of cybersecurity products and services. This analysis will also help identify possible opportunities to increase spending efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be the first EU-wide analysis on the topic.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER encourages national regulators to follow ten principles when conducting this benchmarking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan and execute benchmarking activities to ensure results can serve their intended purpose.</li>
<li>Limit the scope and complexity of information to what is required by the benchmarking analysis.</li>
<li>Use a consistent approach when conducting national analyses.</li>
<li>Identify the stakeholders that will provide the data required by the benchmarking.</li>
<li>Develop reference lists of items for the purpose of benchmarking. For example, considering assets that are relevant for Union-wide high and critical impact processes.</li>
<li>Apply general accounting principles to assess the costs of benchmarked items.</li>
<li>Include macroeconomic factors (e.g. inflation) in the analysis.</li>
<li>Simplify how the effectiveness of investments is evaluated, considering this benchmarking assessment does not require the same level of detail as security assessments.</li>
<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of cybersecurity investments following the benchmarking objectives of the network code.</li>
<li>Explore different approaches for comparing the costs and functions of cybersecurity products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s next?</span></p>
<p>From today&rsquo;s publication, national regulatory authorities have one year to carry out the cybersecurity benchmarking analysis.</p>

<title>Malaysia’s Sustainability Reporting Aligns With Global ISSB Standards In IFRS Jurisdictional Profile</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation has recognised Malaysia&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability reporting in its recently issued Jurisdictional Profile. Malaysia is acknowledged as adopting the ISSB Standards with limited transition, representing the only jurisdiction in the ASEAN region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recognition in the Jurisdictional Profile underscores the global standing of Malaysia&rsquo;s National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Launched in September 2024 and developed by the Advisory Committee on Sustainability Reporting (ACSR), the NSRF is a significant step in advancing Malaysia&rsquo;s corporate sustainability agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NSRF phases in the adoption of ISSB Standards, specifically IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. Starting with a &rsquo;limited transition&rsquo; approach, Malaysia extends certain transitional standard reliefs, including &lsquo;climate-first&rsquo; reporting and deferred Scope 3 GHG emissions disclosures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach facilitates a smooth transition to full adoption of the ISSB Standards, while recognising the varying levels and maturity in sustainability practices and reporting across companies.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said that the ACSR welcomes the ISSB&rsquo;s endorsement, which represents an important recognition of our efforts in using the ISSB Standards as the baseline for sustainability disclosures in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ACSR is cognisant of the high standards the ISSB Standards has set for sustainability reporting, and the challenges this may pose to entities. We remain committed to equipping reporting entities to meet these requirements,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>To ensure the readiness of applicable entities, the NSRF introduced the PACE (Policy, Assumptions, Calculators, Education) initiative, providing training, tools and resources. This includes training on interoperability between the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and ISSB Standards conducted in March this year.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Other upcoming PACE initiatives include the development of Illustrative Sustainability Reports to guide company disclosures and an NSRF Preparers&rsquo; Programme to strengthen capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ACSR will also continue engaging with the industry to understand sector-specific challenges in adopting the ISSB Standards.</p>
<p>The first cohort of Jurisdictional Profiles was published by the IFRS Foundation on 12 June 2025. The publication provides transparency to capital markets on the adoption approaches of different jurisdictions.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority  Consults On Class Exemption For Buy-Backs Of Quoted Debt Securities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is seeking feedback on a proposed class exemption for listed issuers from certain unsolicited offer regulations for buy-backs of their own quoted debt securities.</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director, Evaluation and Oversight Liam Mason said: &ldquo;One of our key priorities is to support innovation and growth by removing unnecessary regulatory burden. &nbsp;This consultation responds to feedback from the market that this is an area where changes could be made to make it easier for firms while still ensuring appropriate investor protection.</p>
<p>The purpose of the unsolicited offer regulations in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act) is to provide a comprehensive and robust framework to protect against &lsquo;low-ball&rsquo; unsolicited offers, as well as to allow the FMA, as the regulator, to take both a proactive and reactive approach to monitoring and enforcement.</p>
<p>However, where an issuer is seeking to buy back its own quoted debt securities, the regulations&rsquo; prescriptive disclosure and timing requirements may limit the flexibility of issuers to manage their debt efficiently.</p>
<p>If granted, the exemption would allow listed issuers to buy back their own quoted debt securities off-market, without needing to prepare certain information in a disclosure document or adhere to certain timing requirements. The exemption would be subject to conditions that the issuer must make available information about the offer to buy back the debt securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Issuers are already subject to ongoing disclosure and governance obligations under the FMC Act, as well as the listing rules of the relevant licensed market, and already have a relationship with their debt security holders. Therefore, the risks may be substantially lower compared to other unsolicited, potentially low-ball, offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>The consultation is open until 25 July 2025</span></p>
<p><span class="button-link--white"><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/business/focus-areas/consultation/consultation-proposed-class-exemption-for-listed-issuers-for-buy-backs-of-quoted-debt-securities/" title="Link to consultation page">View Consultation: Proposed class exemption for listed issuers for buy-backs of quoted debt securities</a></span></p>

<title>Press Conference By KATO Katsunobu, Japan Minister Of Finance And Minister Of State For Financial Services - Iwaki Shinkumi Bank</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, June 3,&nbsp;2025, 8:38&nbsp;am to 8:47&nbsp;am)</p>
<dl><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>I have a question about Iwaki Shinkumi Bank (credit cooperative). Regarding the fraudulent financing issue, the report published by the third-party committee on May 30 pointed out that there were cases in which important facts were concealed and false explanations were given during the investigation. It is also mentioned that there were attempts to conceal details in reporting to the Local Finance Bureau based on the judgment of the bank&rsquo;s headquarters. How do you perceive the bank&rsquo;s stance?</p>
<p>Also, what are your thoughts on ensuring the effectiveness of measures to demand improvements in such financial institutions?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>First, I understand that the third-party committee&rsquo;s investigation report released on the 30th of last week severely criticized the bank&rsquo;s uncooperative attitude during the investigation, including the destruction of important documents, and that such points were explained at the time of the announcement.&nbsp;While the report does mention that the investigation was voluntary and was unable to obtain sufficient cooperation, we find it deeply regrettable that Iwaki Shinkumi Bank still has no apparent attitude to clarify the truth, and we strongly urge the bank to reflect deeply on this matter.</p>
<p>Additionally, although separate from the third-party committee&rsquo;s investigation, there were reports that contradicted the facts, such as claiming that an internal investigation had been conducted despite it did not conduct, in response to the request for a report issued by the Local Financial Bureau in November last year. Although corrections were made to the report subsequently, it is extremely regrettable that accurate reports were not made from the outset. We promptly issued a request for reporting in February of this year, demanding clarification of the circumstances that led to the submission of a report that differed from the facts.</p>
<p>The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has begun on-site inspection to clarify the full details of this case and will continue to thoroughly confirm and verify the facts.<br />Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of the business improvement order, we believe it is necessary to improve the organizational culture of the bank, which has been identified as the underlying cause of the series of irregularities and the uncooperative response to the investigation by the third-party committee.</p>
<p>In the business improvement order issued on the 29th of last week, we have also requested a fundamental review of the bank&rsquo;s management structure and organizational culture, including the clarification of management responsibility and the pursuit of responsibilities from both civil and criminal perspectives.</p>
<p>We are aware that the bank has already announced that seven members, including the chairman, have resigned, and that it will renew its management structure by appointing executives from the Shinkumi Federation Bank and hiring external personnel with expertise in internal management.</p>
<p>The FSA will continue to conduct on-site inspections and other measures to confirm facts. At the same time, while taking into account the bank&rsquo;s issues pointed out by the third-party committee, the FSA will steadily pursue responsibilities from both civil and criminal perspectives. Additionally, the FSA will strongly instruct the bank in fundamentally reviewing its management structure and improving its operations, and will rigorously confirm and verify the progress of such efforts.</p>

<title>CFTC Announces Additional Cost Savings From Office Leases - Plan Saves Millions Over Short And Long Term</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-announces-additional-cost-savings-from-office-leases-plan-saves-millions-2025613/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-announces-additional-cost-savings-from-office-leases-plan-saves-millions-2025613/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the process of extending a lease at its current headquarters while buildout continues on its new offices. The one-year extension represents a 4.5 percent reduction in rental expenses, totaling nearly $1 million. This logical and fiscally responsible arrangement allows for staff to continue their work uninterrupted while the new facility is completed, in full compliance with the President&rsquo;s executive orders, and avoids the excess costs, inefficiencies and inconveniences of moving multiple times. The CFTC has already saved nearly $340,000 by renegotiating its lease at its Chicago branch office.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s new headquarters in an existing building in Southwest Washington is scheduled to come online in June 2026. The lease at the current headquarters in Northwest Washington expires on September 30, requiring a short-term solution. The CFTC was able to negotiate the one-year extension at the current facility at a meaningfully reduced rate. The lease at the new facility will be significantly reduced from the FY 2025 rate of over $21.37 million to just over $6 million.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are additional details about the extension:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The extension will not require additional funding from Congress</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s current rent expense is built into the existing budget.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Rental and payment line items in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/cj"><span>FY 2026 budget request</span></a><span>&nbsp;are unchanged from FY 2025 enacted levels.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The extension is expected to result in savings of 4.5 percent compared with the lease expense in FY 2025.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>The CFTC considered various scenarios and determined that an extension was the most logical, efficient and responsible option.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC partnered with GSA in the search and acquisition process for the new HQ, including regarding contingencies in the event of delays in bringing the new HQ online. &nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While the CFTC has worked with GSA throughout the process, the CFTC negotiated directly with the lessor to extend the lease at the current HQ, as required by statute. This is consistent with decades of historical precedent and practice regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s independent leasing authority and the terms of an MOU with GSA, which covers leases at new facilities, not existing leases.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>While the CFTC and GSA had planned to use temporary space from another federal agency that was in GSA&rsquo;s inventory after the expiration of the CFTC&rsquo;s HQ lease in September 2025, the agreement for the CFTC&rsquo;s temporary space was canceled by the other federal agency due to their mission needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Moving to a temporary space would have also cost millions to move staff and equipment to and from the temporary space as well as the setting up and decommissioning of that space.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Teleworking during this time is not a viable option&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC is committed to complying with President Trump&rsquo;s return-to-office executive orders, just like other Americans who go to work every day without special treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A teleworking posture would still require the CFTC to secure a physical space for its IT infrastructure and other critical services, which would require a lease and two moves, costing millions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The CFTC inspector general identified widespread and prolonged&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12051/oig_SROI_042425/download"><span>telework fraud</span></a><span>&nbsp;during the CFTC&rsquo;s post-COVID fully remote telework period of over four years. This has prompted an ongoing review of CFTC employee compliance with federal government laws and regulations regarding time and attendance to better safeguard American taxpayer dollars from waste and fraud by federal employees who have been collecting pay for time not actually worked. This ongoing review has identified additional instances of telework fraud and misuse of government property and paid official time. CFTC employees are the highest paid in the entire federal government, making nearly $250,000 per year on average.</span></p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Adopts New Framework For Distributing Disgorged Funds Collected To Harmed Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-adopts-new-framework-for-distributing-disgorged-fu-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-adopts-new-framework-for-distributing-disgorged-fu-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-502/osc-notice-publication-osc-rule-11-502-distribution-amounts-received-osc-under-disgorgement-orders">final rules</a>&nbsp;to implement a new statutory framework that will facilitate distributing amounts collected by the OSC under disgorgement orders to harmed investors. Disgorgement is a type of monetary sanction imposed by the Capital Markets Tribunal or the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Disgorgement sanctions require the respondent in a proceeding to pay any amounts obtained because of their non-compliance with securities law or commodity futures law.</p>
<p>Once the rules come into force, under the new process, the OSC will highlight each disgorgement order on a new section of the OSC website and provide investors with the ability to register their contact information if they would like to be contacted about a potential future distribution of disgorged amounts collected under the order. This new section of the website will also allow investors to stay informed about any amounts collected under the order, and whether the OSC has started a distribution. It will also outline how investors can submit claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new distribution framework provides investors who are harmed by misconduct that results in a disgorgement order with a streamlined and transparent framework to recover parts of their losses from amounts collected by the OSC,&rdquo; said Naizam Kanji, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Legal and Governance, Ontario Securities Commission. &ldquo;While the OSC will also continue using no contest settlements and receiverships to return money to harmed investors in appropriate cases, this new process is an important addition to the OSC&rsquo;s investor redress toolkit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pending the coming into effect of legislative amendments to the Ontario&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>,&nbsp;<em>Commodity Futures Act</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Securities Commission Act, 2021,</em>&nbsp;the new rules are expected to come into force in late summer or early fall 2025. The new rules follow careful consultation with stakeholders and support the implementation of the modernized distribution framework prescribed by the 2023 legislative amendments to the Ontario&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>,&nbsp;<em>Commodity Futures Act</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Securities Commission Act, 2021</em>. The introduction of this new statutory distribution framework aligns the OSC with other Canadian and international regulators with similar distribution frameworks.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>BC Securities Commission Launches Scamtones To Help Seniors Avoid Investment Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The BC Securities Commission (BCSC) is turning up the volume on fraud prevention with a new ad campaign that uses custom ringtones to help seniors and their families recognize and avoid investment scams.</span></p>
<p>Investment fraud is one of the most common and most devastating crimes affecting seniors in British Columbia, and it&rsquo;s evolving fast. Scammers use artificial intelligence and exploit digital illiteracy to target older adults, preying on their trust and financial hopes.</p>
<p>To help seniors and their families recognize the warning signs before it&rsquo;s too late, the BCSC is distributing&nbsp;<em>Scamtones</em>, a collection of five custom ringtones that turn every unknown call into a reminder about fraudulent schemes.&nbsp;<em>Scamtones</em>&nbsp;deliver anti-fraud messages in a variety of musical styles &ndash; classic rock, country, Motown and jazz &ndash; while highlighting a key red flag of investment fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scammers may be calling your grandparents more than you are,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Education. &ldquo;<em>Scamtones</em>&nbsp;is meant to spark conversations between seniors and their &nbsp;more tech-savvy relatives about investment fraud in the digital era. These ringtones are a reminder for older adults to pause and think twice about picking up or responding to a suspicious call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ringtones are available on&nbsp;<a>Scamtones.ca</a>, a new microsite where British Columbians can listen to and download the ringtones, as well as find vital resources on investment fraud and elder financial abuse.</p>
<p>The campaign launches ahead of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEADD) on June 15, and aims to shine a spotlight on a growing crisis.</p>
<p>In 2024 alone, global fraud losses linked to elderly victims reached an estimated $77.7 billion, according to the Nasdaq Global Financial Crime Report. In Canada, reported fraud losses topped $638 million, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, with seniors among the most targeted. Seniors make up approximately 19 per cent of the Canadian population and are among the fastest-growing demographics in Canada, according to Statistics Canada. Investment scams are one of the most common types of fraud targeted toward seniors.</p>
<p>Older adults are vulnerable due to a variety of factors: social isolation and cognitive decline can make it harder for them to spot a scam, and fear of losing independence can make them wary of asking for help.&nbsp;Many are drawn to promises of high returns and low risk, hoping to stretch their retirement savings or leave a legacy for loved ones.</p>
<p>Resources about elder financial abuse are available on the BCSC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/avoid-fraud/identify-frauds-and-scams/elder-financial-abuse/" target="_blank">InvestRight.org website</a>, including tips on how to initiate a conversation with a loved one about financial abuse, information about why having a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/news-and-insights/investing-articles/the-value-of-choosing-a-trusted-contact-person/" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;is important, and instructions on how to report suspected investment fraud.</p>
<p><span>Additional Quotes</span></p>
<p><span>Dan Levitt, B.C. Seniors Advocate</span></p>
<p>"Financial abuse &ndash; especially investment fraud &ndash; often goes unreported, yet its consequences can strip seniors of their independence and devastate entire families. As more seniors embrace technology to stay connected, tools like Scamtones provide an engaging way to help them recognize the warning signs of fraud and protect themselves with confidence.&rdquo;<br /><span><br />Laura Tamblyn Watts, President and CEO, CanAge</span></p>
<p>"Scammers exploit the trust and goodwill of seniors, making financial fraud a growing threat. As technology advances, distinguishing a legitimate call from a scam is more challenging than ever.&nbsp;<em>Scamtones</em>&nbsp;is a great resource to help families start crucial conversations about spotting investment scammers &ndash; empowering seniors to hang up, ask the right questions, and safeguard their hard-earned savings."</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Proposes Amendments To Modernize And Streamline Mining Disclosure Standards</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is seeking feedback on proposed amendments to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/securities-law-and-policy/regulatory-instruments/43-401">National Instrument 43-101<em>&nbsp;Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</em></a>.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments are intended to clarify, harmonize and streamline Canada&rsquo;s mining disclosure regime without introducing any new requirements. The proposed amendments would update and enhance the standards for disclosing scientific and technical information about mineral projects to address evolving disclosure practices and policy considerations identified by CSA staff, and to reflect changing industry and investor expectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to provide investors with clear, reliable information about mineral projects so they can make informed decisions, without imposing an undue regulatory burden on mining issuers,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;By modernizing and streamlining the disclosure regime, we aim to maintain Canada&rsquo;s position as the global standard for mining disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to National Instrument 43-101&nbsp;<em>Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</em>&nbsp;are designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove or replace certain definitions and requirements that have become outdated.</li>
<li>modernize and streamline certain requirements to reflect current industry practice.</li>
<li>provide clarification and guidance on certain definitions and requirements.</li>
<li>make other minor language changes to clarify disclosure requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed amendments are published for a 120-day comment period and are available on CSA member websites.</p>
<p>In April 2022, the CSA published CSA Consultation Paper 43-401&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2022/04/6006038-CSA-Notice-43-401-consultation-paper-NI-43-101.pdf">Consultation on National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects</a></em>&nbsp;to inform this project. The CSA received valuable feedback from a large number of market participants, which it has considered.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ISDA Launches Pre-Adherence Period For Notices Hub</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-launches-pre-adherence-period-for-notices-hub-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-launches-pre-adherence-period-for-notices-hub-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has begun a pre-adherence process for the ISDA Notices Hub, enabling firms to sign up to a free protocol that will allow them to use the new platform when it launches on July 15.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, time-critical termination notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods including physical delivery, using company address details listed in the agreement. The protocol will change all agreements between adhering firms to allow them to use the ISDA Notices Hub &ndash; a secure online platform managed by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence that will enable the instantaneous delivery and receipt of termination notices and waivers and help ensure address details for physical delivery are up to date.</p>
<p>Delays and uncertainty over the delivery of notices can lead to losses running to millions of dollars. This can occur if a counterparty has moved offices without updating the address details in their documentation. More recent issues emerged during the pandemic lockdowns, making it extremely difficult to deliver or receive notices because offices were closed.</p>
<p>The ISDA Notices Hub will act as a secure central platform for firms to deliver notices (including waivers), with automatic alerts sent to the receiving entity. Multiple designated people at each firm will be able to access the hub from anywhere in the world, regardless of the situation at its physical location. The platform will also allow market participants to update their physical address details in all their agreements via a single entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ISDA Notices Hub will radically improve the operational efficiency of delivering and receiving time-critical termination notices under ISDA Master Agreements, helping to reduce the risk of losses that can occur from delays. Notices are delivered instantly and are time and date stamped, giving users the certainty they need to move forward with closing out and valuing trades,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>Adherence to the protocol is free for all market participants. Use of the ISDA Notices Hub will be free for buy-side firms, while dealers can benefit from two years of discounted fees if they adopt early.</p>
<p>Firms can sign up to the pre-adherence&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2025-notices-hub-protocol/?special-access=NHP">here</a>.</p>
<p>A letter from ISDA CEO Scott O&rsquo;Malia to market participants requesting their adoption of the ISDA Notices Hub is available&nbsp;<a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/K-ZMCoAgDjfjwW9kI6srhpv1c5?domain=urldefense.com">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) issued today a revised list of validation rules in its Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting, highlighting those which have been deactivated either for incorrectness or for triggering IT problems. Competent Authorities throughout the EU are informed that data submitted in accordance with these ITS should not be formally validated against the set of deactivated rules. The EBA also released today a small validation package including a micro taxonomy package and DPM VR deactivation updates scripts, which are needed from release 4.0, for each deactivation exercises, to deactivate rules in taxonomy and in DPM in a consistent manner.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published final reports on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA32-117195963-1417_Final_Report_Listing_Act_Advice_on_Prospectus.pdf">Prospectus Regulation</a>&nbsp;and on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA32-117195963-1413_Final_Report_Technical_Advice_on_Civil_Prospectus_Liability.pdf">civil prospectus liability</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>These reports provide&nbsp;recommendations meant to facilitate capital market activity by reducing regulatory burden and also include the results of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA32-117195963-1257_Call_for_evidence_prospectus_liability.pdf">ESMA&rsquo;s Call for Evidence on civil prospectus liability</a><span>&nbsp;(CfE).&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span><span>Key proposals and findings</span></span></h4>
<p><span>The technical advice on the Prospectus Regulation contains:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>advice relating to the content and format of prospectuses;</span></li>
<li><span>proposed disclosure annexes for non-equity securities that are advertised with ESG features;</span></li>
<li><span>advice relating to the scrutiny of information in prospectuses as well as advice relating to the procedures for the approval of a prospectus; and</span></li>
<li><span>proposals to updates to the data reporting requirements in line with changes introduced by the Listing Act and in relation to the implementation of ESAP.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The technical advice on civil prospectus liability presents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>feedback received on the CfE &nbsp;where many stakeholders consider that the current regime is well-balanced and argue that reform is unnecessary at this stage;</span></li>

</ul>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESMA has submitted the reports to the European Commission (EC). On the proposals to update the data reporting requirements in line with changes introduced by the Listing Act, the EC shall take a decision on whether to adopt the RTS updating&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/979/oj/eng">Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/979</a><span>&nbsp;within three months. The Commission may extend that period by one month.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In relation to the technical advice on the civil prospectus liability, the EC must present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 31 December 2025. This should analyse the issue of liability for the information given in a prospectus, assessing whether further harmonisation of the prospectus liability in the Union could be warranted.</span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published newly developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/ESMA42-1710566791-6103_Principles_on_third-party_risks.pdf">Principles on third-party risks supervision</a>. These principles aim at supporting a common and effective EU-wide supervisory culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The 14 principles on third-party risks were developed to address the growing risks observed over recent years in the use of outsourcing, delegation or other types of third-party services by supervised firms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The principles provide a&nbsp;</span>common supervisory basis to<span>&nbsp;National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and ESMA, enhancing the robustness of supervisory frameworks and help supervised entities understand and manage third-party risks.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Going forward, ESMA will support the progressive implementation of the principles through supervisory discussions and case studies among NCAs.</span></p>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Statement Before The Senate Finance Committee</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the committee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today. Treasury is committed to working with Congress to improve our nation&rsquo;s finances, create new jobs, and strengthen the economy. We look forward to coordinating with you on the President&rsquo;s Budget and his tax priorities in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this effort, I wish to highlight today the Treasury Department&rsquo;s efforts to advance President Trump&rsquo;s economic agenda on tax and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Treasury has just completed its most successful tax filing season in years&mdash;and we did so while improving efficiencies and cutting costs at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics of the President&rsquo;s efforts to modernize the IRS warned that the effort would result in a 10% shortfall in receipts. Instead, the opposite happened. April receipts this year were up 9.5% over the previous year. And receipts in May were up 14.7% over the previous year. Most remarkably, the President was able to achieve these results while reducing $2 billion in waste and planned IT spending at the IRS.</p>
<p>This success has taken place against the backdrop of one of the most consequential tax proposals ever to come before Congress: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and businesses with certainty and build economic momentum. The legislation is squarely aimed at boosting the working and middle class and reinvigorating American manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the One Big Beautiful Bill will raise&nbsp;take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the average worker. And it will cement no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and tax cuts for seniors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill will also incentivize unprecedented investment in US manufacturing. The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made-in-America. And it will streamline burdensome permitting processes that often stand in the way of new manufacturing projects. It&rsquo;s time for this country to start building things again&mdash;and the One Big Beautiful Bill makes this possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is grateful for the House&rsquo;s efforts to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill. We now look forward to working closely with this committee and other members of the Senate to get this legislation to the President&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade is the second topic I wish to highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progress we have made on tax issues over the last four months complements the significant progress we have made in rebalancing the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I last testified before Congress in May, the President announced the historic US-UK trade deal. This arrangement&mdash;which creates a $5 billion export opportunity for American ranchers, farmers, and manufacturers&mdash;is a preview of what&rsquo;s to come. Dozens of countries have engaged the administration thus far with offers to improve their trade relations with the United States. This includes China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the early hours of the morning, I returned from successful negotiations in London with the Chinese delegation. I am confident these negotiations will bring balance to the economic relationship between our two economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has a singular opportunity to stabilize its economy by shifting away from excess production towards greater consumption. But the country needs to be a reliable partner in trade negotiations. If China will course-correct by upholding its end of the initial trade agreement we outlined in Geneva&mdash;and I believe after our talks in London they will&mdash;then a rebalancing of the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By challenging the decades-old status quo on tax and trade, President Trump is breathing new life into the American economy. More than&nbsp;500,000 private-sector payroll&nbsp;jobs have been added since January. Most importantly, inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy. After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration&rsquo;s policies. Furthermore, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and plentiful labor demand as job openings remain high. This strength has been exemplified in the recent performance of the stock market and consumer confidence data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s bold leadership on these issues has laid the foundation for a Golden Age economy. With your help, we can build on that foundation to create even greater prosperity and abundance for the American people. We hope you will join us in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

The ETF tracks the Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index, which is designed to capture the transformative potential of companies driving the global AI economy.

To be eligible, companies must be included in the Dan Ives AI Revolution Theme Research Report and meet defined thresholds for market capitalization and trading volume. The index applies a modified market capitalization weighting approach, ensuring diversified and meaningful exposure to the full AI value chain&mdash;including cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software, cybersecurity, and data analytics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ETF was listed on 4<span>th</span>&nbsp;June on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol IVES.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steffen Scheuble, Chief Executive Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Developing the Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index for Wedbush reflects our focus on supporting clients with precise and research-driven indexing solutions.

<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R8ZP7BnXNF6IKfNBbJG9kX9iOxc5jcZaDtvOo0TBYQFgoka8ZPBOor3uKa_Q5iiKY_3t5AnEkFF3yHmYZlPuDCpUiLyiuWElHjF3lcXfm8ycU3RKG2BJF58o2HXYMPOM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for May 2025. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly increase in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,835 in May, which is up 2.1% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, North American corporate requests were up 3.7% over May 2024 totals. The monthly increase was driven by an 8.2% rise in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers, a 13.8% increase in requests for certificates of deposit (CDs) with maturities shorter than one year and a 5.7% increase in requests for CDs with maturities longer than one year.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 24.6% versus April totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 21.3% through the end of May. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 154 new CUSIP requests in May, followed by New York (113) and California (109).</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the jury still out on the future of potential interest rate cuts in the U.S., issuers were coming to the market at a healthy clip in May,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;Perhaps most noteworthy is the monthly surge we&rsquo;ve seen in request volume for new short-term CD identifiers, which suggests that at least some market participants are banking on high rates sticking around for a while longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 23.3% in May and international debt CUSIP requests rose 21.1%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 18.2% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 14.5%.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Global broker XM reassures clients in Singapore that &ldquo;no action is required on their part&rdquo; and their &ldquo;funds remain safe&rdquo;, following a recent announcement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), that has led to internet service providers potentially blocking access to XM&rsquo;s website from 20 June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAS has determined that XM and other brokers had been offering leveraged financial products to Singapore&rsquo;s residents without a local capital markets services license<b>. XM has clarified that it is licensed and regulated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Belize in the provision of online investment services globally, it's also important to note that the website does not contain information specifically directed at persons residing in Singapore, and the company has no servers or physical presence in Singapore</b>.</p>
<p>Recognised globally for its reliability and professionalism, XM has been serving traders across more than 190 countries for over 15 years. With a client base exceeding 15 million, the broker has built a strong reputation by prioritising transparency, client satisfaction, and long-term relationships within the trading community. XM also adheres to strict rules and regulations and has robust security measures for protecting client funds and offering reliable platforms and services.</p>
<p>While respecting the authority of MAS, XM emphasized its ongoing commitment to regulatory cooperation and transparency and it is currently assessing the implications of this development with legal advisors, to determine if any action is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continued Access Under International Regulation&nbsp;</p>
<p>XM&rsquo;s platform is operated by XM Global Limited, which is regulated by the FSC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Singapore&rsquo;s law, individuals may opt to use the trading services offered by regulated foreign brokers. This means trading accounts, payment methods, and all services will remain fully functional for Singapore-based clients after 20 June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<b><i>We remain fully committed to supporting our clients in Singapore</i></b>&rdquo;, an XM spokesperson said. <b><i>&ldquo;Our Customer Experience Team is available 24/7 to answer questions and we will ensure uninterrupted access to all trading services, regardless of any changes</i></b>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Global pricing and billing platform leader SunTec Business Solutions today announced a strategic relationship with Curinos, a trusted provider of financial data intelligence and optimization solutions, to embed market insights directly into the core decision-making processes of banks and credit unions.</p>
<p>As financial institutions navigate heightened competition, margin pressure, and shifting customer expectations, the ability to act on more timely, accurate data has never been more essential. By integrating Curinos&rsquo; Treasury Management and Commercial Deposit Analyzer benchmarks within SunTec&rsquo;s Modern Account Analysis and Deal Pricing products, this relationship gives banks and credit unions a new edge in pricing strategy, one that is more agile, smarter, and deeply rooted in market reality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commercial banks are being asked to do more with less - win and retain business, defend margins, and move with agility,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Amit Dua, President of SunTec.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Through this relationship with Curinos, we&rsquo;re turning pricing into a strategic lever by putting market intelligence directly in the hands of treasury sales teams, product managers, and pricing officers, right within their workflows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Driving Precision Across the Pricing Lifecycle</b></p>
<p>Banks leveraging the combined power of SunTec and Curinos can expect transformative benefits across the revenue management lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Market-Aligned Deal Pricing</b>: Relationship managers and treasury sales teams will have access to Curinos&rsquo; proprietary benchmarks while pricing complex commercial deals within SunTec&rsquo;s platform, making negotiations more precise and data-backed.</li>
<li><b>Data-Driven Product Strategy</b>: Product managers can analyze revenue and profitability trends, benchmarked against the market, to refine pricing strategies and align offerings to institutional goals.</li>
<li><b>Client-Level Impact Analysis</b>: Proposed pricing changes can be evaluated at the customer level, allowing bankers to accept or reject changes before routing them for approval, bringing new levels of agility to pricing governance and client engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Banks need actionable data, not static dashboards,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Margarita Vacanti, SVP, Head of Commercial Banking at Curinos</b>. &ldquo;Our relationship with SunTec delivers just that: embedded analytics where they matter most, at the point of decision. It&rsquo;s about enabling smarter pricing, more confident renewals, and a tighter alignment between strategy and execution.&rdquo;</p>

<title>FSB Plenary Meets In Madrid</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary met in Madrid on 11 June to discuss key priorities for global financial stability.</p>
<p>The Plenary confirmed the appointment of Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, as the next FSB Chair for a three-year term beginning on 1 July 2025. Plenary members thanked Klaas Knot for his leadership and guidance in steering the work of the FSB over the past four years.</p>
<p>Members discussed vulnerabilities in the global financial system, issues related to non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI), crypto-assets, climate-related financial risks, and resolution.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Financial stability outlook</h3>
<p>Financial markets have largely stabilised following the sudden and severe spike in market volatility in April 2025 that followed the announcement of US trade tariffs and retaliatory action by some other jurisdictions. The episode illustrated how elevated asset prices, which were highlighted as a vulnerability in recent FSB work, can be susceptible to a sudden unwind in the event of an external shock. Plenary members noted that financial markets remained resilient through this episode, despite much higher trading volumes. Nevertheless, members cautioned that there remains a risk of further market strains given the uncertainty about the economic outlook and the potential for unexpected policy changes.</p>
<p>Members also highlighted key vulnerabilities requiring attention in the coming months. Debt levels, in particular government debt, are high, and debt dynamics are projected to worsen in a number of jurisdictions. Potential vulnerabilities from leverage and liquidity mismatches in parts of the NBFI sector remain, while operational failures can impact critical parts of the financial system. Growing interlinkages between crypto-asset markets and the financial system and increasing use cases for stablecoins warrant closer monitoring.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Non-bank financial intermediation</h3>
<p>The Plenary reviewed the FSB&rsquo;s upcoming recommendations on NBFI leverage, which will be delivered to the G20 in July, and discussed the medium-term work plan aimed at enhancing resilience in NBFI.</p>
<p>Taking forward the FSB&rsquo;s work programme to enhance the resilience of NBFI depends heavily on reliable data. In the course of its work, the FSB has identified several data challenges that have hindered the effective assessment of nonbank sector vulnerabilities by authorities. The FSB has set up a high-level task force, the Nonbank Data Task Force &ndash; chaired by incoming FSB Chair Andrew Bailey &ndash; to address these challenges. The Plenary received an update on the Taskforce&rsquo;s work and approved a near-term focus on use of leverage in government bond markets.</p>
<p>The FSB will publish a report in July detailing progress on its overall NBFI work programme, and a report outlining its workplan to address nonbank data challenges.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FSB work programme updates</h3>
<p>The Plenary discussed progress on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025 and received updates on key initiatives from its committees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Plenary reviewed the status of the&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-climate-related-financial-risks/">FSB Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks</a>, on which the FSB has been asked to provide a progress report to the July G20 meeting. As part of annual work programme discussions, FSB members will continue to evaluate how the analysis of topics, such as physical risks and gaps in insurance coverage, may contribute to a better understanding of financial stability risks.</p>
<p>Members received updates on the implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s global recommendations and the ongoing crypto thematic peer review, which will be delivered to the G20 later this year.</p>
<p>The Plenary also discussed progress on the Resolution Steering Group&rsquo;s key initiatives and future priorities. Members expressed support for ongoing efforts to strengthen resolution effectiveness and enhance crisis preparedness.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia’s Audit Oversight Board Suspends Chengco And Sanctions Auditors From Auditing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysias-audit-oversight-board-suspends-chengco-and-sanc-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysias-audit-oversight-board-suspends-chengco-and-sanc-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia&rsquo;s Audit Oversight Board (AOB) has suspended the registration of Chengco PLT (AF 0886) (CCO) for two years due to serious audit quality issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AOB also imposed sanctions against five of CCO&rsquo;s audit partners who were the engagement partners and engagement quality control reviewers (ECQR) of three public interest entities (PIEs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It suspended Hong Thuan Boon and Yap Peng Boon for two years. It also prohibited Tan Wae Leng, Kong Tung Sam and Ng Kee Siang from accepting as clients and auditing any PIEs or schedule funds for one year.</p>
<p>The sanctions followed the AOB&rsquo;s findings of multiple breaches in relation to CCO&rsquo;s failure to comply with the relevant requirements of the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as adopted by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) when auditing the three PIEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, the findings were in fundamental and key audit areas. These include failures to obtain sufficient audit evidence in areas such as bank borrowings, opening balances and prior year adjustments, use of going concern assumption, other payables and accruals, revenue, cost of sales, redeemable convertible preference shares and goodwill.</p>
<p>Recurring audit deficiencies were also found in the areas of property development costs and fixed deposits.</p>
<p>In addition, the EQCR failed to sufficiently review key audit documentation, particularly those relating to significant judgements and risk areas. This had an adverse effect on overall audit quality.</p>
<p>These findings were prevalent across the audit engagements inspected and some were recurring from the AOB&rsquo;s past inspection on CCO. Despite being previously sanctioned by the AOB in 2019, CCO failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall audit quality. Hong Thuan Boon and Yap Peng Boon were also previously sanctioned by the AOB in 2019.</p>
<p>CCO appealed to the SC against the AOB&rsquo;s enforcement action. The SC dismissed the appeal and affirmed the AOB&rsquo;s decision. The suspension took effect from 12 June 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The affected partners did not appeal the AOB&rsquo;s enforcement action. Their suspensions and prohibitions were effective concurrently from 30 April 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Customers Are Key – Super Trustees Need To Listen And Act Now - Keynote Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The AmCham Regulator Luncheon Series In Sydney On 12 June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Super funds hold the keys to the future for millions of lives and are another link in the chain that binds Australia and the US. But sadly, our work across the sector has exposed its shortcomings and blind spots.</li>
<li>The next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s work in the superannuation sector will address how trustees learn from and respond to the complaints they receive.</li>
<li>A trustee&rsquo;s approach to complaints is a clear and meaningful measure of whether they&rsquo;re focused on the interests of their members. Customer-centric means complaint-aware.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are on Gadigal Country. I pay my respects to Elders past and present &ndash; and I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past decade, Australia&rsquo;s total superannuation assets have grown to more than $4.1 trillion in funds, giving super a larger market capitalisation than all companies on the ASX.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly an impressive achievement.</p>
<p>And its growth, alongside the universal nature of superannuation and its preservation until retirement, makes super a pillar of stability for the Australian economy.</p>
<p>But quantity isn&rsquo;t everything. We must have quality too. Size and growth should not outstrip governance &ndash; nor customer service.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s here that we&rsquo;re seeing a great divide between what can be reasonably expected of super funds, and what is found in practice.</p>
<p>Superannuation is currently the subject of significant regulatory and enforcement action from both ASIC and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.</p>
<p>So today I want to address that divide head-on.</p>
<h2>The role super plays in the economy</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the role of super in the economy.</p>
<p>Australia doesn&rsquo;t make it into the top 50 countries in the world when it comes to population size. We&rsquo;re 55<sup>th</sup>. And yet our super industry constitutes the fourth largest retirement savings pool in the world, surpassed only by the US, the UK, and Canada. And by the next decade we&rsquo;re expected to have the second largest retirement system globally.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>It's no surprise, then, that super is growing faster than our economy and is larger than our GDP.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
<p>Our regulatory settings have contributed to the strong growth of the sector &ndash; and, more broadly, for many years super has played a role in intermediating retail investor participation in public and private markets &ndash; more about that later &ndash; and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>On this point, ASIC is currently looking at super and its role in the future shape of our public and private markets and what, if anything, ASIC needs to do to improve confident investor participation in those markets.</p>
<p>Given its size, Australia&rsquo;s super system has emerged as a significant force in our local capital markets, as well as those abroad. Over the last decade super funds&rsquo; investment allocations to international public equities went from 21% to 30%, surpassing domestic public equities investment.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>And of course, given the size and depth of its economy, the United States is a natural destination for this capital.</p>
<p>Which means Australians aren&rsquo;t the only beneficiaries of the super system. More and more Australian capital is behind American infrastructure projects, data centres, and energy and technology businesses. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macquarie Asset Management, which works with 18 out of the 20 largest superannuation funds in Australia, owns the Long Beach Container Terminal in California and the Goethals Bridge linking New York and New Jersey.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, this means our funds can be increasingly exposed to assets that don&rsquo;t perform as expected &ndash; AustralianSuper&rsquo;s recent $1.1 billion write-down in the US software company Pluralsight being one example.</p>
<p>But in any case, it&rsquo;s clear that the super industry, given its scale and focus in both the Australian and American economies, is another link in the chain that binds our two nations closer together.</p>
<p>On that note - I know that questions around trade, tariffs, defence, and critical minerals may be on the minds of many in this room. As Australia&rsquo;s corporate and markets regulator, ASIC of course has no direct role in relation to those issues.</p>
<p>However, an important part of the work we do requires close-knit international collaboration, and we have strong, enduring and mutually beneficial partnerships with US regulators &ndash; particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>We work together &ndash; including across international forums &ndash; on common global market issues, such as scams and fraud, the use of AI, fintech innovation, and the dynamics we&rsquo;re seeing between public and private markets.</p>
<p>We also engage regularly on supervision strategies, investigations and general enforcement approaches.</p>
<p>As a regulator, this collaboration is critical to ensuring strong markets and ultimately Australia and America&rsquo;s prosperity.</p>
<h2>Super trustees are failing Australians in a critical service</h2>
<p>The size and scale of the super industry alone would put it in a position to have a unique influence on the economy &ndash; and thus the lives of everyday Australians whose money it holds. But that money is also the life savings, the retirement funds, of most of our citizenry &ndash; money entrusted to superannuation funds in good faith to be preserved for when the time comes to retire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that super funds hold the keys to the future for millions of lives &ndash; and so they&rsquo;re trusted with all the responsibilities and obligations that go with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for the super sector to be rightly praised for the returns it generates from its investments. But the real value of those investments is what they actually represent to Australians: the hope of a comfortable, secure retirement after a lifetime of hard work &ndash;&ndash; and the promise that their money will be there when needed.</p>
<p>But sadly, our work across the sector has exposed its shortcomings and blind spots.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s work has laid bare governance challenges, and exposed super trustee board blind spots around their data, systems, and processes. For example, our death benefits review found that even the fastest trustees processed less than half (48%) of their death benefit claims within three months. The slowest processed only 8% in that time.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, that&rsquo;s a long time for your loved ones to be waiting to be paid your money if they need to make ends meet.</p>
<p>A total of&nbsp;<strong>zero</strong>&nbsp;trustees in our review monitored or reported on end-to-end death benefit claims handling times. Nor did they have performance objectives for these times.</p>
<p>Many trustees didn&rsquo;t even monitor how long their open death benefit claims had been going &ndash; was a claim 90 days old or 500 days old? If the trustees had done that &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>as we did</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; they would have found that claims went unresolved for months and sometimes years.</p>
<p>And importantly &ndash; it was an increase in complaints that led to our review of death benefits claims handling. Service complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) about death benefit claims more than tripled in a two-year period<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, and in 2023 we saw an increase in these same complaints in trustees&rsquo; internal dispute resolution data.</p>
<p>If trustees had acted on this data &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>as we did</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; they may not be facing enforcement action today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about anything new here &ndash; we&rsquo;re talking about well-established principles of governance and responsibility. When we published our &lsquo;Better banking for Indigenous consumers&rsquo; report,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[8]</sup></a>&nbsp;we highlighted the ways banks were failing to put their customers first. When we published our report on financial hardship,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp;we highlighted the same failings by lenders.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes we hear from funds that further investment in data, systems, and processes is too costly or too difficult. For example, one trustee has delayed investing in a better workflow tracking and reporting capability for close to three years &ndash; even after external advice identified deficiencies. The new capability was needed to improve a critical member service.</p>
<p>But the risks of not investing are just too great. It&rsquo;s in the interest of all Australians to have well-run, resilient superannuation funds. So let me be clear on this point &ndash; ASIC isn&rsquo;t going to question critical investments in data, systems, and processes that are essential to the delivery of member services.</p>
<p>But you can expect we&rsquo;ll question their absence.</p>
<p>All this points to the cold hard truth that super trustees have to get a grip on their data, systems, and processes. They have to know what&rsquo;s going on in their own business.</p>
<p>That is why ASIC has been calling on the sector to improve, following an ongoing thread of governance failures. And why we warmly welcome the government&rsquo;s proposed mandatory and enforceable service standards to drive improvement in trustee conduct.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s next phase of work &ndash; complaints information</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why the&nbsp;<strong>next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s work in the superannuation sector is to address these &lsquo;board blind spots&rsquo;</strong>. Specifically,&nbsp;<strong>our focus is on how trustees learn from and respond to the complaints they receive</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Because no business can thrive without understanding the people it serves. To do this, it needs market feedback. And a primary source of this feedback is &ndash; and always will be &ndash; customer complaints. A trustee&rsquo;s approach to complaints is a clear and meaningful measure of whether they&rsquo;re focused on the interests of their members. It also indicates the maturity of the trustee&rsquo;s approach to risk. That&rsquo;s why ASIC has been urging industry to act on complaints for some time now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget, it&rsquo;s already an enforceable requirement to regularly analyse complaint data to identify systemic issues.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[11]</sup></a>&nbsp;<strong>This is member services 101.</strong>&nbsp;So a failure of data, systems, and processes doesn&rsquo;t just let their members down &ndash; it means trustees are failing to comply with their obligations. And, where appropriate, ASIC will pursue enforcement action in response to that failure.</p>
<p>After all, super trustees have an obligation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>act honestly</li>
<li>exercise the same degree of care, skill, and diligence as a prudent trustee, and</li>
<li>perform duties and exercise powers in the best financial interests of beneficiaries.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[12]</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, they&rsquo;re required to act efficiently, honestly, and fairly in providing a super trustee service.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&nbsp;But&nbsp;<strong>none of this is possible without the right information</strong>. That&rsquo;s why trustees&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;have robust arrangements in place to oversee how complaints are being handled, to be able to interrogate complaint data and have confidence that systemic issues are being addressed.</p>
<p>For the executives in the room who aren&rsquo;t working for super trustees, just change the word &lsquo;trustee&rsquo; to &lsquo;company&rsquo; in a lot of what I&rsquo;ve said, and know that ASIC is just as focused on how you&rsquo;re supporting&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the right information to make good judgements, you simply cannot govern effectively. It&rsquo;s that fundamental. So if management isn&rsquo;t collecting or providing that information &ndash; trustee board directors need to be demanding it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no good having a policy of acting in the customer&rsquo;s best interest if it&rsquo;s not practiced. It was an increase in complaints that led to our review of death benefits claims handling. That increase should have led to a review by the funds themselves.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t. Why? Because they didn&rsquo;t know. So I repeat &ndash; without systems in place for collecting, tracking and analysing the right information, you simply can&rsquo;t fulfil your obligations.</p>
<p>Again and again we return to the same theme: customer-centric or member-centric can&rsquo;t be lip service. It has to be lived, day in, day out. And customer-centric means complaint-aware.</p>
<h2>Conclusion &ndash; reading the riot act</h2>
<p>I was recently described in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Review&nbsp;</em>as &lsquo;reading the riot act to big super.&rsquo;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/trusting-trustees-with-our-4-trillion-in-superannuation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[14]</sup></a>&nbsp;This is, of course, a reference to the Riot Act of 1715, which permitted an officer of the law to disperse any crowd &ldquo;unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled together&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While we usually see the phrase used to describe someone being told off, the original law required the Riot Act to be read to the crowd&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;any attempt was made to disperse it. Once the Act had been read, however, if the crowd failed to follow its command, all of those present were guilty of a felony. Which means that &lsquo;reading the riot act&rsquo; actually is more than a telling-off &ndash; it&rsquo;s a warning to stop making trouble or there&rsquo;ll be more trouble.</p>
<p>So consider this speech a reminder that ASIC has read the riot act to the super industry. Super plays a crucial role in the Australian economy. It holds the trust &ndash; and the savings &ndash; of millions of Australian families, mums and dads, the old and the young. The industry has a solemn responsibility to protect the interests of all Australians, and to give them every confidence their money will be there, readily available, when it&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>To the extent that some trustees aren&rsquo;t across the data, systems, and processes of their funds, they&rsquo;re failing to live up to that solemn responsibility.</p>
<p>To that extent, they&rsquo;re causing more trouble and suffering for their members &ndash; their customers.</p>
<p>And to that extent, there will be trouble &ndash; for any trustees who fail to know their business, inside and out, and to act in the best interests of their members.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&rsquo;s Investor Forum will demonstrate ASX&rsquo;s solid momentum in progressing our FY28 New Era strategy.</p>
<p>As we approach the third year of our five year strategy, ASX&rsquo;s senior management team will give a detailed update on key aspects of our strategic deliverables, including progress against our technology modernisation program. Investors will also receive financial guidance and hear more about growth opportunities across ASX&rsquo;s lines of business.</p>
<p><b>ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse said</b>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasing to be at the stage in our strategy where we can show steady progress of key deliverables. This is particularly the case for our technology modernisation program and in the way we&rsquo;ve been engaging with our customers and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have a way to go, and there are areas such as operational risk and business resilience where we are redoubling our efforts and making further investment. Getting this right will secure our foundations for growth and we&rsquo;ve established the new Accelerate Program to drive delivery of these outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each line of business presentation will provide detail on their market dynamics and opportunities. This year&rsquo;s Investor Forum will also include a discussion on the importance of our EBITDA margin, which will sit alongside underlying ROE as a key performance metric for the organisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms Lofthouse said: &ldquo;Our revenue growth ambition and ongoing focus on expense management are drivers of the financial measure of success for ASX, and we are targeting EBITDA margin percentage expansion over the medium term.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Key financial information and guidance</h4>
<ul>
<li>FY25 total expense growth rate expected to be at mid-point of previously provided guidance range of between 6% and 9%;</li>
<li>FY25 operating expense growth expected to be at mid-point of guidance range of between 4% and 7%;</li>
<li>ASX is guiding to FY26 total expense growth range of between 8% and 11%, with FY26 operating expense growth rate of between 4% and 7% which reflects the same range as FY25;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Key drivers of FY26 operating expense growth rate include increase in technology costs from software license charges, costs associated with delivery of Accelerate Program and legal costs associated with ongoing ASIC actions;</li>
<li>FY25 capital expenditure expected to be within a narrowed range of between $170 million and $180 million, and remains within the original guidance provided<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Capital expenditure guidance for FY26 narrowed to a range of between $170 million and $180 million, with FY27&nbsp; range maintained at between $160 million and $180 million &ndash; this capex profile is in line with previously provided guidance and ASX&rsquo;s intention is for this to reduce after FY27;</li>
<li>Intention to maintain capital management settings for dividend payout ratio of between 80% and 90% of underlying net profit after tax, and potential operation of Dividend Reinvestment Plan;</li>
<li>Targeting EBITDA margin percentage to expand beyond the current level over the medium term;Underlying ROE remains key performance metric, medium target range of between 13.0% and 14.5%.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key operational highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>The project to replace CHESS continued to meet several milestones during the period including opening the first industry test environment for Release 1 in February &ndash; targeting go-live for Release 1 of Q4 FY26, now less than a year away;</li>
<li>Final stages of delivery for key Cash Market Trading project (Service Release 15) which will provide customers the benefit of a single opening auction;</li>
<li>Delivered ASX24 platform upgrade that improves interest rate futures liquidity;</li>
<li>Developed a new pricing policy for Clearing, Settlement and Issuer Services that continues to provide transparency regarding pricing for our customers and a reasonable return on the risks we take as a business;</li>
<li>Established Accelerate Program to bring pace and intensity to work which will further uplift operational risk management and resilience;</li>
<li>Continued execution of disciplined expense management initiatives expected to deliver annualised savings of ~$17 million into FY26 and targeting similar saving in FY27;</li>
<li>Ongoing Listings activity attracted total capital onto exchange of $79.0 billion for financial YTD to 31 May 2025 (after delisted capital for the same period of $54.3 billion, this delivered net new capital of $24.7 billion);</li>
<li>Created products to support the energy transition challenge with the launch of three environmental futures contracts and Wallumbilla natural gas futures;</li>
<li>Launched a new infrastructure service (ASX Colo OnDemand) that gives customers a new way to access the Australian Liquidity Centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to execute against our strategy, and our operating expenses and capex requirements are reflective of where we are in our five year plan. The investments we are making today are building the capabilities to drive revenue growth and underpin shareholder value in the longer term,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ASIC&rsquo;s Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets was held at the University of Technology Sydney Broadway campus on 10 June. The following facilitated Private markets, where to now? panel followed&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/opening-remarks-at-the-asic-symposium-on-australia-s-public-and-private-markets/" title="Opening remarks at the ASIC Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s Public and Private Markets">Joe Longo&rsquo;s remarks</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-symposium-panel-state-of-our-markets/" title="ASIC Symposium panel: State of Our Markets">State of Our Markets panel</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Calissa Aldridge, Executive Director &ndash; Markets, ASIC:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for that thoughtful and insightful panel session. It&rsquo;s clear that public and private markets both play a critical role and are important for the future of our success here in Australia.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to move on to the second panel, so thank you, James, you can stay there. This next one&rsquo;s on private capital markets. These markets have obviously grown significantly over recent time, as our Chair outlined. They&rsquo;ve tripled in the last decade, for example. While off a low base in Australia, there&rsquo;s a consensus in the submissions that we received that there are structural changes, and something that we need to focus on.</p>
<p>So what opportunities does this change create for Australia and what does that mean for access to capital, investor protection and market integrity? This panel will explore all these questions, focusing on where private markets are going to head to, thinking about some of those opportunities and challenges that we need to confront.</p>
<p>So joining James are our four esteemed panel members. I welcome to the stage Simone Constant, ASIC Commissioner; Matthew Michelini, partner and Head of Asia Pacific at Apollo; Jason Collins, Managing Director, Head of Australia at BlackRock; and Peter Warne, Non-Executive Director of UniSuper, Virgin and a range of others. So thank you, over to you, James.</p>
<p><strong>James Thomson, AFR, Chanticleer Columnist:</strong>&nbsp;I just might need one more bottle of water here. Here we go. Well, we&rsquo;ve got a great panel here to really dig into the private markets side of things, which we gave you a bit of an entree in our first panel.</p>
<p>Peter, we could barely find a better placed panellist to talk about the crossover between public and private markets. You&rsquo;re the Director of UniSuper, which, of course, invests in both public and private markets. You&rsquo;re also the Chairman of Virgin, who Guy Fowler has helped steer onto the public markets and out of private ownership. From the perspective of a director, what are some of the differences between those two sides of the coin, and what&rsquo;s driving the growth in your mind in private markets?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Warne, Non-Executive Director, UniSuper:</strong>&nbsp;The big difference for a director is just the focus on scrutiny and reporting, and just think about the range of things a company, a listed company, has to do that an unlisted company doesn&rsquo;t have to do. Just go through the annual report setting, semi-annual results coming out, an annual general meeting, a remuneration report, continuous disclosure, following what the analysts are saying, so you have to advise the market if it&rsquo;s out of line with what your internal rates are. You have to have director elections. So they&rsquo;re all things I would call big R regulation.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a whole lot of other stuff which is small R regulation, which not much ASIC could do about that. But when you think about it, the shareholder communications, visiting shareholders regularly, the ASX corporate governance rules, which is getting a lot of play, which I mentioned several times. Talking to analysts, analyst conferences, road shows you have to do, going and seeing proxy advisors, all things which are not written in the corporations law, but every company has to do and it&rsquo;s expected that your public shareholders are going to have to do those sort of things. So it&rsquo;s just a huge time burden on management and on the board.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not talking yourself out of the role as Virgin Chairman, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, it&rsquo;s so much fun.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Just given the super fund perspective on our last panel, do super funds need a thriving public market as well?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. There&rsquo;s no doubt about that. The vast majority of super fund assets, or the majority of super funds, are in the listed markets, either in equities, or whilst government bonds aren&rsquo;t listed, they&rsquo;re a public market and an actively traded market. So still the vast majority of assets are that way. In UniSuper&rsquo;s world, over 80% of its total assets are in the public markets in one way, shape or form. So they need it (a) for liquidity, and then (b) for just a price-setting mechanism that they have confidence in. So that is absolutely required.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Do you feel they&rsquo;re thriving at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Well, they&rsquo;re not growing as rapidly as they perhaps have been in the past. They&rsquo;re certainly still very active, and certainly people can get set in good volume when they want to, to either sell or buy. So they&rsquo;re still, I&rsquo;d say, in good shape. But they are not growing as fast as we would like to see them grow.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, fair enough. Jason, BlackRock&rsquo;s been a champion of public markets for decades, one of the great democratisers of public markets, really. But in the last few years, the business has made three big bets on private markets. Can you tell us why that&rsquo;s occurring inside the home of passive investing in public markets?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Collins, Managing Director, Head of Australia, BlackRock:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it&rsquo;s a massive strategic tilt that the company made last year. We announced three acquisitions, two of which have been completed. The first being Global Infrastructure Partners, a very large infrastructure player, quite large in Australia as well. The second is HPS, which has not been closed yet, but that&rsquo;s a large private credit business. And the third is Preqin, which is a data provider. And actually, five years ago, the company acquired another business called eFront, which is a technology company which really shines a light on portfolio holdings in private markets. So it actually looks at data from GPs and helps trustee boards and other organisations to understand what they own, so through funds and through vintages of funds.</p>
<p>So, yeah, a big strategic tilt. It was made for a couple of reasons. Very big-picture thinking from the founders of the firm. Essentially, they felt there was a mismatch between the demand for capital and the traditional sources of capital. And by that, I mean governments. Governments around the world have high debt-to-GDP levels, above 90% in the world. The US is 125%, Japan over 200%. It&rsquo;s quite well known. Governments around the world have reducing tax bases as well. You&rsquo;ve got, in the EU, 22 of 27 member states, the working-age population&rsquo;s declining. You&rsquo;ve got, in Australia, one in 10 people will retire in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>So with high debt-to-GDP, a lower taxation base in the future, there&rsquo;s a real need for private capital to meet some pretty critical needs in the global economy in infrastructure. So really big-picture thinking around how to solve this mismatch. And I can go into why there&rsquo;s such a critical need for private markets at the moment in infrastructure, but that&rsquo;s kind of the thinking behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, and just in Australia, does the business reflect that tilt? Like your Australian operations, is there a lot of that stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Collins:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing. I started BlackRock 12 years ago, and the first seven years of my life was selling BlackRock to Australia. And the last five years, I&rsquo;ve been selling Australia to BlackRock. And on the ground now, we have a massive private markets investor presence, coming up to 50 investors, about $30 billion of assets deployed in private markets in Australia. We actually invest around $280 billion in Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets. 80% of that money is actually from offshore investors.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a huge voice now in the policy settings for foreign investors. And our business here used to be a product and distribution business. It&rsquo;s now an investing business. It&rsquo;s now a technology business to reflect the fact that we&rsquo;re actually facilitating so much foreign flows into the country.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah. Matthew, Apollo makes no bones about which side of the fence it&rsquo;s &ndash; you sit on. I&rsquo;m not sure if people have read Apollo&rsquo;s submission, but it basically calls the public markets in Australia little more than a concentrated bet on a few miners and four-bit banks. Which I love, being for its honesty, if nothing else. But tell us a little bit about the sort of global boom in private capital, and how that is changing the market down here.</p>
<p>Matthew Michelini, Head of Asia Pacific, Apollo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure. By the way, it&rsquo;s not just the Australian market. It&rsquo;s markets everywhere. A lot of what the last panel talked about or touched on, and a lot about what this panel is touching on, is actually about portfolio construction. And it used to be OK to put publics together. 60% equities, 40% bonds, and maybe a little bit of risk. And that was because when you bought the S&amp;P, you were buying into a diversified stream of cash flows in companies that represented the underlying economy. In the debt markets, something very similar.</p>
<p>The challenge is that the structure of the markets changed quite significantly over the last 20 years. And so when all this portfolio application theory came out 20 years ago, you could put a 60-40 portfolio together, you could get a diversified stream of cash flows, you could get stocks and bonds correlating negatively, so you had somewhat of a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>As the structure changed, at the same time you had every central bank across the globe print money. You had every government going into a fiscal deficit. Most of that surplus went into the financial markets. There&rsquo;s very few places that can absorb all that liquidity. It&rsquo;s the European markets, it&rsquo;s the Chinese markets, it&rsquo;s the US markets, it&rsquo;s commodities. And then you start to have smaller tier two markets that can&rsquo;t absorb all that liquidity.</p>
<p>So the public markets, by and large, became indexed, correlated, concentrated, all driven by passive money. Passive money is effectively daily liquid funds that buy when they get inflows, sell when they get outflows, irrespective of the underlying cash flows of the business.</p>
<p>And so the question is not whether concentration, as the last panel talked about, is it good or bad. The question is, is it a fact? And so how do you achieve diversification? How do you not lever a big chunk of a retirement system, a big chunk of an individual savings to NVIDIA, which can lose $800 billion in a given day? And so every investor across the world is asking, how do I get diversification in my portfolio?</p>
<p>The easiest way to get diversification right now is adding privates. And that didn&rsquo;t used to be the case, by the way. Privates really used to just be the venture capital hedge funds, private equity. But what the US did, and what you&rsquo;re seeing Europe do, and even what you&rsquo;re seeing Australia do a little bit, is you&rsquo;re seeing governments ask the private markets to step up and do more, and the banks to do less. And so now you have private markets that range from AAA-rated risk, all the way down to equity. So you can create a diversified portfolio with publics and privates at all points along the risk-reward spectrum.</p>
<p>I think that another mention was made by Raph about the over-indexation to US markets. You&rsquo;re going to need other sources of diversification. All of a sudden, now you need currency diversification, and so on and so forth. But the biggest and easiest way to get diversification in a portfolio is a blend of public and privates.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, Matt. Simone, one thing I really like about the prices that ASIC&rsquo;s been through is, as Joe said, you try to really keep an open mind, not prejudge the outcome. You&rsquo;ve seen all the 90 submissions, including the 40 that are private. You&rsquo;ve done 40 meetings, I believe, with industry participants. What&rsquo;s surprised you about the private market feedback, particularly?</p>
<p><strong>Simone Constant, Commissioner, ASIC:</strong>&nbsp;I would say the biggest surprise was probably an upside surprise in terms of the number of submissions and the quality. Now, I say surprise; I actually hoped it would be that. I often say publicly I&rsquo;m a big believer in Australia&rsquo;s financial system and all the participants, and I think you can see that from the attendance tonight. But it didn&rsquo;t mean I expected that to come through.</p>
<p>So I think to get 90 submissions, which we did, 50, as you say, public, 40 private, and then to have had so much engagement as well. And the meetings, the engagement, some of those with people who put in submissions, who said, do you want to come and talk to us about it, do you want to spend some time, including folks actually who are here with me this evening. The quality and breadth of the submissions as well, though.</p>
<p>I think some of them, some of the submissions, you mentioned the Apollo submission. Let&rsquo;s be honest, the Apollo submission was extraordinary, I think, and the amount of time and thinking that went into it. So there was a quality of the submissions, but the breadth. Every industry, I think, was, every part of the financial services industry was covered. We had firms, we had super funds, we had banks, we had &ndash; even insurers responded. Obviously, there were lobby groups, as you mentioned. Individuals, and we heard from an individual tonight. So just the people who took the time.</p>
<p>And I think in terms of actual surprises in what we read, I think I got surprised, pleasantly surprised about the interest from offshore. And you can see we&rsquo;ve got Blackrock and Apollo here tonight. That&rsquo;s no coincidence. It was a real pleasant surprise that offshore, we had such big global players so interested in our markets that they took this so seriously.</p>
<p>And I think also the numbers. So we were honest when we put out the discussion paper and said, we&rsquo;re probably not getting the numbers right. We don&rsquo;t have the data to do so. What was really confronting, though, was a few of the submissions, including some of the super funds, including the Apollo submission, said you&rsquo;re way off. You should be thinking about it this way.</p>
<p>And one of the numbers that stood out to me was that 96% of Australian companies that earn over $100 mil in a year, they&rsquo;re private. That&rsquo;s really significant. When you look at the employment numbers, it&rsquo;s about 85% of people are employed in the private. So the way to think about the size of the private prize, I think, was probably a surprise for me as well.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Does that raise any concerns that something you weren&rsquo;t entirely worried about being systemic, might actually be closer to systemic than you think?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. So I think what wasn&rsquo;t a surprise was the number of responses that said, look, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about this part, or you don&rsquo;t need to worry about this part. You expected that, and that&rsquo;s great. We invited everyone&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Another thing that did surprise me, actually, was the number of submissions that said, actually, this is something you should be worried about. And one area which really came through with maturity were the number of private credit, for example, private credit participants, who said, actually, you should be thinking about a bit more, if not regulation, more transparency in the private credit space.</p>
<p>And some of that was geared toward end investor. Some of that was geared toward protection or awareness and transparency to borrower. But some of that absolutely was geared toward, you need to really confront how significant this is. It may not be a problem, but you need to know the size of this wall in case it becomes one.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Peter, there&rsquo;s clearly some regulatory differences, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;d call them differences or gaps, between public and private, but which ones sort of stand out to you? And do you have a sense of whether we need to close, we need to regulate these two markets more similarly? Just grab your mic there, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>Warne:&nbsp;</strong>The couple of gaps that really stand out, I think, are valuation. Public market valuations are the last traded price at the 30th of June for one BHP share. Whereas if you&rsquo;ve got valuation of properties, for example, the valuers look at what the last time that a property like that traded, which could have been two years before. And it just is ridiculous. I mean, we saw that in spades post the 2022 rise in interest rates. All the listed REITs were down 30%, but the on-balance-sheet single property valuations stayed constant for another 18 months. I mean, that&rsquo;s just ludicrous. And that really calls into question, I think, private markets when valuations are so clearly different.</p>
<p>So I think a clearer definition, and maybe it&rsquo;s a gift for ASIC, that could be really clear about what we&rsquo;re valuing here. What is the real purpose of the valuation in private markets? Is it what we think that we could sell this particular asset for on the 30th of June, as opposed to what the latest model said, or the latest time we saw a property like that sell? I think there&rsquo;s some clarity on that.</p>
<p>And then more clarity on the real liquidity attributes of particular assets. I think Raph talked about this a lot. And when we&rsquo;re offering through super funds at least one day, if not three-day, liquidity on assets, clearly, if you&rsquo;re trying to sell the whole asset in the market, it would take six months. I think we have to be very careful about that. We need some better definitions of what liquidity are, what valuation is, and really more transparency about what the true investment process is. I think they&rsquo;re all gaps, I think, that could do with tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Matt, Peter&rsquo;s taken us to the issue of valuation, which you must get a lot. And I know there&rsquo;s differences in the regulatory framework between the US and Australia at the moment. What does good regulatory intervention look like around valuations and transparency?</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:</strong>&nbsp;Look, I think there&rsquo;s &ndash; on valuation specifically, I think that I agree quite a bit with what Peter said. I think that Australia thinks about this a little bit from an equity lens and a real estate lens, and I&rsquo;ll throw in the credit lens. In valuation, there should be principles around good valuation. And by and large, third party, you either need some third-party independent evaluation agent coming in from time to time to evaluate those marks, or you need the benefit of having a third party having validated the price from time to time.</p>
<p>For us, almost everything that we do, especially on the credit side, we syndicate. We take some, we syndicate some, so there&rsquo;s some price checks and price validation, and then we use third parties to mark that to market along the way for things that are illiquid.</p>
<p>But I caution against &ndash; not in equities, but in credit, by and large, I caution against using marks or quotes as an indication of where you can move the entirety of a position. Because the liquidity structure of the fixed-income markets, at least in the US and in Europe, have changed quite significantly. I mean, it takes five days to move a bond without moving the price. 26% of investment-grade bonds in the US haven&rsquo;t been traded in the last month. So broker quotes aren&rsquo;t a really good, reliable source of where you can move a position on any given day.</p>
<p>But valuations, I&rsquo;ll go back to Raph&rsquo;s point again from the last panel, valuations actually are quite important in the private markets for a few reasons. One is, as an investor, you need to know your risk positions. Whether they&rsquo;re public or whether they&rsquo;re private, whether they&rsquo;re in your I-can-liquidate-or-not-liquidate bucket, you need to know from a portfolio perspective what your risk positions are.</p>
<p>Number two, very often managers earn fees on NAV. And so you take a look at like a private credit fund that&rsquo;s picking. OK, well, you&rsquo;re paid on pick, and if you never take a write-down for the company that&rsquo;s not picking, that&rsquo;s a good thing for the manager, not necessarily a great thing for the investor.</p>
<p>But the other thing that I&rsquo;ll mention that Peter said is, if you go all the way to the other end, which is for private equities, for instance, you&rsquo;re not looking to sell those on any given day. And so the big question in valuation is, you can have a third party come in and value those, but that&rsquo;s not the part of your portfolio you expect to sell and move on any given day. You&rsquo;re not liquidating them today. So you can look for some valuation framework, but then it&rsquo;s, what is the construct? Is it to move it today, or is it to move it over some reasonable period of time? And so I think if regulators give some general principles about valuation practices and constructs, it&rsquo;s actually quite &ndash; I would imagine that the industry leaders are already there, and most other firms would catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Jason, your ultimate boss, Larry Fink, he&rsquo;s sort of made no secret of trying to let a hell of a lot more sunshine into this area by using data, including from some of the sources that you mentioned earlier, to try and make private capital investments publicly tradable. Do you think you can crack this nut? And how much of it is about getting this valuation question right?</p>
<p><strong>Collins:</strong>&nbsp;So the holy grail would be to be able to index private markets and allow access to retail investors, mums and dads, more easily. Now that&rsquo;s a fair way off. The Preqin acquisition, Preqin does a couple of really interesting things. Firstly, it tracks 190,000 funds across 60,000 managers. It tracks performance data. It tracks the underlying portfolio companies within the funds, transactions there. And ideally what the benchmarks can do, firstly it helps clients track their own performance against the industry. But if you can find a way to create, and it could be tokenisation, it could be an ETF across private markets, that would be an incredible breakthrough.</p>
<p>I think Larry in his letter wrote, I don&rsquo;t really know how we&rsquo;re going to do that yet, but have faith in us, we managed to do this in ETFs, and that was a new technology which has really taken off. That&rsquo;s part of the reason that we did the Preqin acquisition, to try and bring benchmarking and transparency to the market. It&rsquo;s a really big task to collect that data, I think that&rsquo;s a big task ahead of ASIC if it wants to go down that path. But certainly we&rsquo;ve been having discussions with ASIC around that.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, Simone, clearly this issue of valuations is at the heart of so much of our private markets. We just had a couple of suggestions about regulatory guidelines rather than necessarily something prescriptive. How does that sound? That idea of setting some standards, I guess, that help bring the lower end of the market perhaps up to the industry leaders?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that valuations has been front and centre. A few really great thoughts, though, that come through tonight are reminders. One is it&rsquo;s about valuation in context, and different investors, it might be quite different, may approach valuation differently. For example, we&rsquo;ve heard tonight about illiquidity premium, also controlled premium.</p>
<p>I think the point about valuation in context is also important because when we&rsquo;re thinking about valuation by super funds, I can see a lot of my APRA colleagues here tonight who work and spend a lot of time on valuations when it comes to super funds, so there are some very developed standards in parts of the Australian market for valuations.</p>
<p>More broadly, though, absolutely where that&rsquo;s absent, guidance is appealing. So being very public in that statement; guidance is appealing. Guidance does seem like the right approach. I think guidance, though, only goes so far with valuations. You&rsquo;ve got to think, why can valuations be a problem? Well, it&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s paired with other problems, isn&rsquo;t it? So you&rsquo;ve got a liquidity problem, which has come out tonight, so what&rsquo;s disclosed about liquidity? You&rsquo;ve got a conflicts problem, for example, so there&rsquo;s a valuation that leads to unfair treatment of investors because there&rsquo;s conflicts of interest. So it&rsquo;s not just valuation for valuation&rsquo;s sake or transparency around that for its sake. So it&rsquo;s looking at the related issues.</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;s also not just about valuation per se and, say, doing it quarterly. Nor is it just about who does it. It&rsquo;s the basis of it and the disclosure. And what I mean by that is some may know there are practices that think about valuation on an as-developed basis. So you have a block of land today that might be worth X amount, but the valuation that&rsquo;s used and as part of the distribution of product is, oh, once it&rsquo;s developed and there&rsquo;s a piece added to it and this is done and that is done. Even if you think about valuation that way, you need to match that with some effective disclosure.</p>
<p>And I think that leads to the final point. Effective disclosure is only effective if we get some alignment or guidance on terms. There&rsquo;s some interesting terms used to support valuations and practices in different parts of the private markets and actually some terms should mean something when they&rsquo;re working their way into valuations and people investing or people borrowing.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;I thought you were going into the unrealised gains territory there for a moment. Peter, super funds have been under a lot of heat about valuations in the last &ndash; of unlisted assets in a little while. And my sense is that APRA has really asked the industry to pick up its game. Have you learnt anything from that process, or is there any learnings from that process that you would particularly point to that might be helpful as we think about the broader private market question?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Well, you&rsquo;re right. APRA has been really focused on that. So I think all super funds have now moved to quarterly. It begs the question whether there needs some adjustment; is quarterly even frequent enough? And where there&rsquo;s been substantial market moves in between quarters, what&rsquo;s the response to that? Where we&rsquo;re buying and selling units on a daily basis with our members. So I think that process.</p>
<p>Certainly the move to independent valuers, and regularly changing independent valuers, has been part of all that. But I still think we need a clearer definition about what we&rsquo;re valuing. What is the purpose of this valuation? What is this valuation actually supposed to mean? I think we had a few years ago a well-known private equity investment held by a number of superannuation funds, and each super fund had a wildly different valuation. That just brings into question the whole credibility of what we&rsquo;re talking about here when you&rsquo;ve got that situation arising. Now, each super fund was getting its own independent valuation, I&rsquo;m sure, but it still seems a bit strange when you get results which are so wildly different.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Matthew, lots of the big, Apollo I know a lot of its other peers in the US have been very intent on going down the investor scale from institutions down towards wealth management, for example, more towards the individual level. Does that bring up access when we&rsquo;re giving more individuals more access to private markets? I mean, in theory, it&rsquo;s a good thing that they get to balance their portfolios like the big guys do, but does it come with issues in your view?</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:&nbsp;</strong>It does. Look, as an overarching theme, it&rsquo;s a good thing to use the term democratise the access to private assets. Private assets, as we noted, used to just be risky; private equity, venture capital, hedge fund, and that was only really suitable, I&rsquo;ll use that word intentionally, for big institutions or high net worth clients with a diversified portfolio who were well advised and financially sophisticated.</p>
<p>As the definition of private markets has evolved massively over the last 10 years, you now have, again, investment grade product that used to sit on bank balance sheets that&rsquo;s now being originated by the likes of Apollo, the likes of BlackRock and others. And then you have stuff that&rsquo;s a little bit more yieldy, like direct lending, or what most of the headlines call private credit. And then you have things like infrastructure and you have things like real estate.</p>
<p>So the short answer is yes, it&rsquo;s a good thing. The question really comes down to is it appropriate for the investor base? If you look at the average person walking down the street that doesn&rsquo;t have financial advice, that doesn&rsquo;t think about the financial markets all day, that probably needs liquidity or access to liquidity more often than not, going into an ETF structure that&rsquo;s part public, part private, sounds like a really good solution for that. If you are somewhat advised, if you have somewhat of a portfolio, if you don&rsquo;t need daily liquidity, then doing something like direct lending or asset-backed credit or infrastructure could be appropriate.</p>
<p>And so in our minds, yes, it is good to give individuals access to private markets. Individuals globally are massively under-allocated private assets. They&rsquo;re just sitting in the concentrated stock markets and the concentrated bond markets. Giving them tools to diversify their own portfolios is a good thing, but one needs to really think about the suitability of the product for the cohort of the underlying investor.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Can I just ask you, you mentioned private credit there, Matt. Do we have a slightly rosy view of our private credit sector in Australia? I know when I talk to visiting Americans about what&rsquo;s happening in private credit in the US and other places, it&rsquo;s a very different industry. I mean, here it&rsquo;s sort of mainly property lending, isn&rsquo;t it? And whether we&rsquo;ve stuck a sort of cool badge on.</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:</strong>&nbsp;The short answer is private credit does mean something different in Australia than it does in the US, but it is converging. So private credit in the US, when you read the headlines, typically talks about direct lending. Our own personal view, our own firm view, is that we&rsquo;re not in a bubble in direct lending, but it is cyclical, and we are at the top of the cycle. That&rsquo;s both in the US and that&rsquo;s probably in Australia as well.</p>
<p>But if you talk about the private credit markets all together, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re talking about property lending. You&rsquo;re talking about asset-backed lending. You&rsquo;re talking about direct lending. In asset-backed lending, that could be mortgages, that could be autos, that could be credit cards.</p>
<p>I think what we have observed here, outside of the staples of direct lending and real estate lending, is you do have a private asset-backed market. And I think increasingly, the banks are starting to think about, I think the banks are starting to think about how can we partner with private capital to be balance sheet-like in some businesses and be more fee-driven, less balance sheet-driven, and how do we really put some of this balance sheet in private capital hands to price it on a market basis? So I think that that trend will evolve in Australia over the next couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got time for one question, if there&rsquo;s someone out there with a quick one. Simone, I want to ask you about the private credit question there. Do you worry that there&rsquo;s concentration of risk in private credit in property? Is that something we should be thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;We wouldn&rsquo;t say worry yet. We&rsquo;ve got to get the data together. We would say we worry we don&rsquo;t yet have the data to answer your question. And then if the data suggested that, which anecdotally it does, and by the way, the submissions did. I&rsquo;ve read all the submissions and this is something that comes through, then that is something we should pay attention to. The concentration to real estate, which seems to be a big part of the domestic private credit story, we do know in the past that&rsquo;s been, when there&rsquo;s been system shock, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s been. So that is one of the key reasons we need to get more transparency and more data to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Jason, I&rsquo;m going to do the Joe-Longo-for-a-day trick again. Five to 10 years, how do we make &ndash; what&rsquo;s a change you&rsquo;d like to see, could be market-led or regulatory-led, that would help private capital markets become more fair, efficient, resilient?</p>
<p><strong>Collins:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so in the next, I would take it out a bit further, five to 10 years, say 10 years, you&rsquo;ve got a wave of retirees that can come out of their super funds, and they&rsquo;ll need advice. And because they need advice, they will need access to private markets. And right now I&rsquo;m not sure the products that are being offered to the retail market, or even the wholesale market, evergreen funds for example, which was highlighted today by Ian Patrick from ART, are the right set up necessarily under the current needs of investors.</p>
<p>So there are some developments in the UK, with the FCA, with LTAF Funds. In Europe with, are they called, ELTIF funds I think they&rsquo;re called, and policy settings around these developments where you can mix private and public markets are pretty encouraging. Right now we don&rsquo;t have any evergreen structures. The longest we know we&rsquo;ve got is a month&rsquo;s redemption cycle, because we think there&rsquo;s a bit of a risk with the liquidity duration right now.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>Matt, what would you like to change?</p>
<p><strong>Michelini:&nbsp;</strong>Well I&rsquo;m going to do one better than Guy, and I&rsquo;m not going to cop out, I&rsquo;m going to pander. I actually think the reason we took the time to write the report that we did was it is rare for a regulator to say, to accept the private markets as something that&rsquo;s not going away. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s here, it&rsquo;s something that is, that can be a good thing. And the acceptance of, with the right engagement, and the right regulatory approach, without it being a witch hunt, that they can create a very robust access mechanism for private assets, as well as a robust investment ecosystem here in Australia.</p>
<p>I think as you go across the world that isn&rsquo;t the case. Most reports you read on private credit or private assets is, it&rsquo;s systemic risk, it&rsquo;s going to take the world down, it&rsquo;s going to take the banks down, it&rsquo;s going to take our country down, it&rsquo;s going to do this. Here, here it&rsquo;s been, we accept private assets are here to stay. How can we have Australia most productively engage with them? So I think this type of engagement will lead to good outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:&nbsp;</strong>We call that sucking up in Australia. Peter, you&rsquo;ve raised some really good points about valuation. Is there anything else you&rsquo;d sort of call out in the next 10 years that we could do?</p>
<p><strong>Warne:</strong>&nbsp;Well, in addition to valuation, I think collecting and publishing data on a system-wide basis, would actually give us all a lot more confidence in exactly what the private markets are and the size of them, the depth of them, and the processes that use them. So I commend ASIC in endeavouring to collect more data.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to remember one of the big triggers for the GFC was the mortgage lending market in the US, and that was all done on a state basis and no one collected the data. So the Fed didn&rsquo;t actually know how big this thing was until it actually blew up. So I think we&rsquo;d all be better off with knowing more data and understanding whether there are system risks or not system risks there, to manage the whole process better. But liquidity, valuations and transparency are the three.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Simone, you&rsquo;ve obviously been working towards this paper over the last quarter of the year. But can you give us a sense of some of the priorities that have come out of this view? Valuations, transparency, understanding the size of the sector better. Are they the top three, or is there a few you&rsquo;d add?</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;So, I think that&rsquo;s the polite way of not asking me what I do.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, well, if you&rsquo;re going to tell us, please go for it.</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong>&nbsp;So the focus is, I think focus areas for us have come through tonight. Continuing to look at wherever ASIC, within ASIC&rsquo;s gift there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s getting in the way of entities being able to see through growth in a listed market. That really comes through in the submissions. So if there are ways that ASIC can make it more viable to be medium to long term focused as a company, so that&rsquo;s on the public market side.</p>
<p>On the private market side, the convergence theme that&rsquo;s coming through we consider pretty important, in the sense that it&rsquo;s not just about the getting companies on the board. It&rsquo;s not just about the companies. It&rsquo;s also about that access and participation. So we need to ensure there&rsquo;s the opportunity to participate. Australia is a nation of investors, like a world-leading nation of investors, not just through your super funds. We need to preserve that participation. So areas that can bring that forward are actually data and transparency.</p>
<p>So the data and transparency side, yes, it&rsquo;s really important from the system side, but it&rsquo;s also important for that convergence and opening up private markets to individuals. And something really exciting in the submissions we received are entities like BlackRock and some of the other big internationals thinking how can we give that information and use transparency in that way?</p>
<p>Finally, on the downside, it&rsquo;s probably come through in the remarks tonight. We will be accelerating our work on private credit. We are accelerating our work on private credit. And as I said, credit to many in the industry who brought that forth in their own submissions. Private credit, as we keep saying, private credit is good for the economy and access. We&rsquo;re about the economy and the financial system. It is good for the economy, for investors and borrowers, if done well. We need to first consider is it done well, where it&rsquo;s not, shine a light on that, and dimension what that done well looks like. And that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll be accelerating.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, Simone. It&rsquo;s a great outlook, we&rsquo;ll look forward to what we&rsquo;re going to get towards the end of the year. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please thank Simone, Jason, and Peter.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure to speak at the Asia Trader Forum for the first time as the Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). It is great for me to engage with the buy-side trader community in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a timeless maxim in our industry: Markets live by liquidity, and liquidity lives by traders. Today, I want to talk about how you, Hong Kong&rsquo;s trading community, participate in our markets and make them breathe.</p>
<p>As the capital market regulator of the Hong Kong international financial centre, we understand it is of utmost importance to strengthen ties with market stakeholders, including all of you here today. As buy-side traders, you play a pivotal role in the smooth functioning of our capital markets. Your contribution is significant to the value creation process for both your firms and investors. This also lays a very solid foundation for Hong Kong&rsquo;s success and sustainable development as a world-leading asset and wealth management centre.</p>
<p>Today, I want to cover four key areas to help build closer ties between the SFC and the trader community, and to align our objectives in order to foster a more vibrant Hong Kong market.

<title>ASIC Cracks Down On Unlawful Finfluencers In Global Push Against Misconduct</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has issued warning notices to 18 social media &lsquo;finfluencers&rsquo; suspected of unlawfully promoting high-risk financial products and providing unlicensed financial advice to Australians as part of a Global Week of Action Against Unlawful Finfluencers by nine international market regulators.</p>
<p>Last week, ASIC and regulators from the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Hong Kong and Canada took coordinated actions to crack down on unauthorised finfluencers.</p>
<p>Together, the nine regulators used a combination of regulatory and enforcement powers including arrests, warning notices, website takedowns, educational schemes with authorised finfluencers and consumer awareness programs to put unauthorised finfluencers on notice and warn consumers of the risks of unauthorised and misleading finfluencer content.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, &lsquo;Regulators across the world have joined forces to disrupt unlawful finfluencer activity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s important that consumers separate fun from fact when it comes to finfluencer content. Popularity doesn't equal credibility. Check their credentials and whether they&rsquo;re licensed or authorised, before checking your money out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following the issuance of INFO Sheet 269&nbsp;<em>Discussing financial products and services online</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/discussing-financial-products-and-services-online/" title="Discussing financial products and services online">INFO 269</a>) in 2022, ASIC has observed a noticeable drop in social media posts spruiking financial products and services by unauthorised finfluencers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Australia, after ASIC issued INFO 269, we saw that many finfluencers changed what they were saying or became licensed or authorised representatives to comply with the law,&rsquo; Mr Kirkland added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australian Financial Services licensees who engage influencers also improved their due diligence and monitoring of finfluencers to ensure they don&rsquo;t provide unlicensed financial services and that consumers are not misled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s current concerns lie with finfluencers positioning themselves as so-called trading experts, who are providing unauthorised financial product advice and promoting high-risk, complex investment products that can cause real consumer harm, such as contracts for difference (CFDs) and over the counter (OTC) derivative products.</p>
<p>Their social media content is often accompanied by misleading or deceptive representations about the prospects of success from the products or trading strategies they promote, sharing images of lavish lifestyles, sportscars and other luxury goods.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are seeing a pattern where these unlicensed finfluencers invite consumers to join their closed communities or forums to learn their secrets to success or copy their trades,&rsquo; Mr Kirkland said.</p>
<p>If a finfluencer is not licensed, an authorised representative or exempt, they&rsquo;re legally not permitted to carry on a business of providing investment advice in Australia.</p>
<p>Investors and consumers can check the credentials of finfluencers out by using&nbsp;<a href="https://service.asic.gov.au/search/">ASIC&rsquo;s professional registers search</a>&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>Recent Moneysmart research found that 41% of young Australians seek financial information or advice from online sources such as social media, including finfluencers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s financial services laws protect investors and promote market integrity. They set minimum requirements and provide important protections for investors if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you spruik or discuss financial products and services online, you need to carefully consider how the law applies to you and seek legal advice if you are unsure,&rsquo; Mr Kirkland said.</p>
<p>ASIC conducts targeted monitoring of financial discussion by finfluencers that feature or promote financial products. Where we see harm occurring, we will take action to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Unlicensed activity can be reported to ASIC on our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/contact-us/reporting-misconduct-to-asic/" title="Reporting misconduct to ASIC">How to report misconduct</a>&nbsp;webpage or by calling 1300 300 630 so that we can consider appropriate regulatory action.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In addition to ASIC, the nine regulators involved in the Global Week of Action Against Unlawful Finfluencers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canada, Alberta Securities Commission</li>
<li>Canada, Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers, Quebec,</li>
<li>Canada, British Columbia Securities Commission</li>
<li>Canada, Ontario Securities Commission</li>
<li>Hong Kong, Securities and Futures Commission</li>
<li>Italy, Commissione Nazionale per le Societ&agrave; e la Borsa</li>
<li>United Arab Emirates, Securities and Commodities Authority</li>
<li>United Kingdom, Financial Conduct Authority</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC issued&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/giving-financial-product-advice/discussing-financial-products-and-services-online/" title="Discussing financial products and services online">INFO 269</a>&nbsp;in March 2022 for social media influencers who discuss financial products and services online.</p>
<p>The licensing provisions under the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act) apply to persons who carry on a financial services business in Australia. This includes persons who provide financial product advice or arrange for a person to deal in a financial product. Carrying on an unlicensed financial services business in Australia is an offence under the Act, unless authorised as a representative of a licensee or relying on an exemption.</p>
<p>The Act imposes significant penalties, including up to five years&rsquo; imprisonment for an individual and financial penalties into the millions of dollars for a corporation.</p>
<p>The law also prohibits conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or is likely to mislead or deceive, in relation to financial products or services. A finfluencer does not need to be licensed to breach the misleading or deceptive prohibitions.</p>
<p>In December 2022, the Federal Court found social media finfluencer Tyson Robert Scholz contravened s911A of the Corporations Act by carrying on a financial service business (between March 2020 and November 2021) without an Australian financial services licence (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-371mr-federal-court-makes-findings-against-social-media-finfluencer-tyson-scholz/" title="22-371MR Federal Court makes findings against social media &lsquo;finfluencer&rsquo; Tyson Scholz">22-371MR</a>).</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson On The Extension Of Compliance Date For Form PF</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission voted to extend the effective compliance date for relevant registrants to comply with the revised Form PF. The Joint Final Rule by the Commissions was adopted over a year ago on February 8, 2024. As Securities Exchange Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw noted in her statement during the SEC&rsquo;s public meeting today, registrants have had a significant window of time to prepare for tomorrow&rsquo;s compliance deadline. The issues raised indicate potential technology-based concerns as well as challenges with validation, testing, and ensuring effective capabilities for timely and accurate reporting of requested information. These issues should have been fully addressed prior to today. In the least, the issues should have been presented to the Commissions before the eleventh hour to enable proper investigation and resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>Notwithstanding grave concerns, I have moved the request for an extension. In part, my decision is intended to demonstrate the strength and value of bi-partisan Commissions as well as our ability to reach the best outcomes for our markets, our economy and our nation. I am hopeful that the Commissions leadership&rsquo; commitments to democratic processes continue to prevail and our regulation continues to protect investors, encourage market integrity and stability, and foster and promote the deepest, most liquid markets in the world.</span></p>

<title>Statement On The Extension Of The Compliance Date For The Amendments To Form PF, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins and thank you to the staffs of both the SEC and the CFTC for your work.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s extension gives affected persons additional time to comply with the requirements associated with the new amendments to Form PF.&nbsp; I appreciate the comment letters that have expressed concerns with the technical aspects of complying with revised Form PF that have helped inform this extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In addition to giving time to market participants and the Commissions to address these technical issues, the delay gives flexibility to address other unforeseen concerns with respect to revised Form PF.&nbsp; This approach will mitigate the potential for an outcome where uncertainty, confusion, and ambiguity in technical requirements results in firms spending significant amounts of money to file reports with data that is useless, inconsistent, and not of any value to the SEC or other government agencies that rely on such reports. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action is necessary to address significant shortcomings with the 2024 amendments to Form PF.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; The rulemaking ran afoul of what &ldquo;good regulation&rdquo; looks like, in that it failed to answer a fundamental question: do the economic and information benefits yield results that are commensurate with the compliance burdens to the firms?&nbsp; When the burdens outweigh the benefits&mdash;such as where the provisions are both costly and likely ineffective&mdash;this represents the worst rulemaking outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, commenters expressed concern about disaggregating each component fund of a master-feeder arrangement and parallel fund structure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; One commenter explained that disaggregated information would be &ldquo;misleading and difficult to analyze,&rdquo; and that it is &ldquo;not the type of information that the Commissions likely would be able to readily and accurately re-aggregate.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissions&rsquo; response was simply to &ldquo;disagree&rdquo; that the information would be misleading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-form-pf-061125-statement-extension-compliance-date-amendments-form-pf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As firms have tried to implement what the Commissions required, the technical shortcomings with these and other requirements have become more apparent.</p>
<p>In moving forward, it is important to balance the sensitivity of the data included in Form PF with any corresponding benefits.&nbsp; The costs associated with this data are significant&mdash;both in terms of compliance costs and demands on firm personnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you to the SEC staff in the Division of Investment Management, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Office of the General Counsel for your work on this matter to date.</p>

<title>Extensions On Extensions: Statement On Further Extension Of The Form PF Compliance Date, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today&rsquo;s open meeting looks like a straightforward Commission vote to extend a compliance date for a recently adopted rulemaking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;But there is more here than meets the eye. The reality of our action today is more complex &ndash; and more concerning. And the clock is ticking because the compliance date at issue is, in fact,&nbsp;<i>tomorrow</i>.</p>
<p>Form PF is the confidential form on which certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds report information to the SEC that helps us to understand potential systemic risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The SEC, and other regulators including FSOC, depend on these detailed data to better comprehend when the private markets may be experiencing turbulence that could affect our entire financial system. Because these entities generally operate outside of our regulatory view, these data are our best &ndash; and perhaps only &ndash; way to spot large scale financial disasters originating in the private funds market, or amplified by private fund exposure, before they happen. And, these data can help us understand more fully the impact of a market event if it has already occurred.</p>
<p>The recent amendments, and the &ldquo;new&rdquo; version of the form they create, would improve the quality of these data so that they are more precise and helpful for identifying and responding to systemic risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Remember, many of our pension fund dollars are invested in private funds &ndash; so understanding risks in this market is important for American retirement savings.</p>
<p>Today, the Commission is attempting to extend the new form&rsquo;s compliance date under the wire, with just hours to spare, to accommodate a last-minute request<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;from some of the most highly sophisticated, highly resourced entities in our financial system, who have already been given an extension several months ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Now they&rsquo;re back for more time with what doesn&rsquo;t seem like a credible reason.</p>
<p>The truth is that we are here to extend this compliance date not because firms actually need additional time to comply, but to allow for reconsideration of these amendments more broadly. If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll find the proof in footnote 12 of today&rsquo;s release. That footnote admits that the Commission is delaying the Form&rsquo;s compliance date so it can revisit &ndash; or perhaps endeavor to abandon &ndash; this information altogether.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;So, although this extension is for just a few more months, I suspect that we will continue to accommodate requests to extend this compliance date until we have significantly revised or undone this rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<h2>Abandoning the APA</h2>
<p>And so, with this vote, we plough ahead and do exactly that. We are simply disregarding the authority of&nbsp;<i>two</i>&nbsp;previous Commissions &ndash; at both the SEC and the CFTC &ndash; who adopted this new form just one year ago. And while I would posit that entities in such a situation should abide by regulations lawfully adopted and thus file the new form, this procedural quagmire is certainly a far cry from what the APA intends.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Much has been said about the Commission&rsquo;s desire to &ldquo;return&rdquo; to a reasoned agency process,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;but this desire is nowhere to be found when there&rsquo;s a looming compliance date that some would like to dodge.</p>
<h2>Less Information, But More Retail Access</h2>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that this timing also just so happens to be aligned with a powerful policy push to increasingly open private markets to retail investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;By preventing these amendments from coming online, we are willfully blindfolding the Commission and similarly hobbling our and other financial regulators&rsquo; ability to conduct more precise and effective analysis of private markets. This further undermines our ability to do data-driven rulemaking in the future,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;including our ability to effectively do an economic analysis if this or any future Commission tries to open private markets to retail investors. And the timing couldn&rsquo;t be worse, as evidenced by increasingly widespread concern about the stability of private markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Refusing to receive these improved data on systemic risk doesn&rsquo;t make those risks go away. And we can&rsquo;t have it both ways. We can&rsquo;t suggest that its perfectly safe and appropriate for investors of all stripes to gain exposure to these markets while we are going out of our way to put our head in the sand about what&rsquo;s actually going on in those same markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-form-pf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course, if this Commission wants to revisit Form PF and reconsider any part of the Form, it can attempt to do so as part of the rulemaking process and in proper coordination with the CFTC. Not by forcing through an eleventh-hour compliance date extension under false pretenses.</p>
<p>Thank you to the staff in the Division of Investment Management, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for their work on this release. I&rsquo;m particularly grateful to many of these team members who also worked on the final form amendments last year. I hope that, one day, the Commission will actually experience the benefits of your work and the important data from these Form PF amendments.</p>

<title>Statement At Open Meeting On Further Extension Of The Form PF Compliance Date, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-at-open-meeting-on-further-extension-of-the-form-pf-compliance-date-p-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-at-open-meeting-on-further-extension-of-the-form-pf-compliance-date-p-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here. This is an open meeting on the 11th of June 2025 of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Government in the Sunshine Act. Commissioners Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, and Mark Uyeda are also present.</p>
<p>Today the Commission will vote on extending the compliance date for the most recent amendments to Form PF. Currently, the compliance date for these amendments is tomorrow, June 12, 2025, but I support extending the compliance date to October 1, 2025. The initial compliance date for these amendments was March 12, 2025. In January, the SEC and CFTC jointly extended the compliance date to June 12, 2025. Notwithstanding the prior three-month compliance extension, we have received credible commentary that the current timeline simply does not provide private fund advisers with sufficient opportunity to interpret, implement, and test their systems to ensure accurate and consistent reporting. From my experience with complex technology projects, I sympathize with those points. It is evident to me that additional time is required for dialogue with filers, review of the reasonableness of the data demands, and review of the actual utility of the information collected.</p>
<p>The most-recent changes to Form PF will necessitate costly upgrades to internal infrastructure, increased coordination across business units, and integration with third-party vendors. These tasks are inherently complex and require extensive testing to ensure accuracy. Rushing this process increases the likelihood of data errors, which defeats the entire stated purpose of the form&mdash;to enhance systemic risk monitoring.</p>
<p>Form PF was first introduced in 2011 and has subsequently been amended three times, most recently in February 2024. Each time the form has been amended, it has required advisers to provide additional information and more granular data. As a result, even without the most recent amendments, Form PF imposes significant compliance burdens on the private fund industry. The complexity of the form, in addition to the ever-evolving nature of its demands has required advisers to seek costly legal and compliance support to complete it accurately. These costs divert resources away from advisers&rsquo; core investment functions.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to our action today, I have directed the staff to undertake a comprehensive review of Form PF. I have serious concerns whether the government&rsquo;s use of this data justifies the massive burdens it imposes. We should work hard to keep our information requests to a minimum, requesting only what is needed and no more. As the saying goes, &ldquo;Measure twice, cut once.&rdquo; While this important work is being done, private fund advisers will continue to provide a wealth of information on the prior version of Form PF.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC for their agility in responding to these concerns.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll turn the meeting over to Natasha Greiner, Director of the Division of Investment Management, for the staff&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Statement Before The Appropriations Subcommittee On Financial Services And General Government</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessents-statement-before-the-appropriations-subcom-2025612/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessents-statement-before-the-appropriations-subcom-2025612/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chair Hagerty, Ranking Member Reed, and members of the subcommittee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today. Treasury is committed to working with Congress to improve our nation&rsquo;s finances, create new jobs, and strengthen the economy. The President&rsquo;s Budget request for Treasury demonstrates our commitment to boosting growth, promoting efficiency within our agency, and targeting illicit actors that threaten our national security. We look forward to coordinating with you on the President&rsquo;s Budget and his tax priorities in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this effort, I wish to highlight today the Treasury Department&rsquo;s efforts to advance President Trump&rsquo;s economic agenda on tax and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Treasury has just completed its most successful tax filing season in years&mdash;and we did so while improving efficiencies and cutting costs at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics of the President&rsquo;s efforts to modernize the IRS warned that the effort would result in a 10% shortfall in receipts. Instead, the opposite happened. April receipts this year were up 9.5% over the previous year. And receipts in May were up 14.7% over the previous year. Most remarkably, the President was able to achieve these results while reducing $2 billion in waste and planned IT spending at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This success has taken place against the backdrop of one of the most consequential tax proposals ever to come before Congress: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and businesses with certainty and build economic momentum. The legislation is squarely aimed at boosting the working and middle class and reinvigorating American manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the One Big Beautiful Bill will raise take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the average worker. And it will cement no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and tax cuts for seniors.</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill will also incentivize unprecedented investment in US manufacturing. The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made-in-America. And it will streamline burdensome permitting processes that often stand in the way of new manufacturing projects. It&rsquo;s time for this country to start building things again&mdash;and the One Big Beautiful Bill makes this possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is grateful for the House&rsquo;s efforts to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill. We now look forward to working closely with this subcommittee and other members of the Senate to get this legislation to the President&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade is the second topic I wish to highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progress we have made on tax issues over the last four months complements the significant progress we have made in rebalancing the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I last testified before Congress in May, the President announced the historic US-UK trade deal. This arrangement&mdash;which creates a $5 billion export opportunity for American ranchers, farmers, and manufacturers&mdash;is a preview of what&rsquo;s to come. Dozens of countries have engaged the administration thus far with offers to improve their trade relations with the United States. This includes China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just returned from successful negotiations in London with the Chinese delegation. I am confident these negotiations will bring balance to the economic relationship between our two countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has a singular opportunity to stabilize its economy by shifting away from excess production towards greater consumption. But the country needs to be a reliable partner in trade negotiations. If China will course-correct by upholding its end of the initial trade agreement we outlined in Geneva&mdash;and I believe after our talks in London they will&mdash;then a rebalancing of the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By challenging the decades-old status quo on tax and trade, President Trump is breathing new life into the American economy. More than&nbsp;500,000 private-sector payroll&nbsp;jobs have been added since January. Most importantly, inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy. After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration&rsquo;s policies. Furthermore, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and plentiful labor demand as job openings remain high. This strength has been exemplified in the recent performance of the stock market and consumer confidence data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s bold leadership on these issues has laid the foundation for a Golden Age economy. With your help, we can build on that foundation to create even greater prosperity and abundance for the American people. We hope you will join us in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Problem Form: Statement On Further Extension Of Compliance Date For Form PF, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, June 11, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Natasha [Greiner] and Oliver [Richard]. I support extending the compliance date for the February 8, 2024 amendments to Form PF<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;to October 1, 2025.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Extending the compliance date until then will give filers and their third-party service providers additional time to develop and test their reporting systems. As the request letter noted, &ldquo;private fund advisers subject to the rule [need] additional time to build and test the new reporting systems and work through any outstanding reporting and interpretive questions with the goal of providing uniform data to the Commissions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The new form is not ready for prime time. The extension reflects a commitment to good governance and common-sense implementation.</p>
<p>Although I support an extension, my concerns about Form PF and its recent expansions persist. We should reassess whether the information the form collects aligns with the intended purpose of the form. As I noted in my dissent to the adoption of the amendments we are extending, &ldquo;unbridled curiosity rather than . . . a legitimate regulatory objective&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;shapes the demands of Form PF. Overly extensive reporting requirements not only are unduly costly and invasive, but erroneously suggest that the government&rsquo;s role with respect to private funds is akin to its role supervising banks, which have a government backstop. I support the Chairman&rsquo;s directive to review Form PF to determine whether it serves its intended systemic risk mitigation purpose.</p>
<p>I want to thank the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC staff in the Divisions of Investment Management and Economic and Risk Analysis and Office of General Counsel for their quick work in drafting the extension release. Let me close with a word of thanks to Natasha Greiner, who has served the Commission so well for almost a quarter of a century, culminating with her role as Director of the Division of Investment Management.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-formpf-061125?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Thank you, Natasha, and we wish you the best as you leave the agency. Your willingness to pitch in and help wherever you could will continue to serve as a model for the rest of us. You will be missed.</p>

<title>CFTC: Federal Court Orders Michigan Man, California Man, And Two Nevada Companies To Pay Over $25 Million For Digital Asset Fraud</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-federal-court-orders-michigan-man-california-man-and-two-nevada-companie-2025611/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-federal-court-orders-michigan-man-california-man-and-two-nevada-companie-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final default judgement against&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Mark Gillespie</strong></span><span>&nbsp;of Michigan,&nbsp;</span><span><strong>John Roche</strong></span><span>&nbsp;of California,</span><span>&nbsp;<strong>My Big Coin Pay, Inc.</strong></span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span><strong>My Big Coin, Inc.</strong></span><span>, both of Nevada.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The order requires Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., and Roche to pay, jointly and severally a $19,326,324 civil monetary penalty and $6,442,108 in restitution to defrauded victims in connection with their role in a digital asset fraud scheme. The order also imposes a permanent injunction against the defendants and bans them from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets; entering into any transactions involving commodity interests or digital asset commodities; and registering with the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span><strong>Case Background</strong></span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The default order finds from at least January 2014 through June 2017, Gillespie, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., My Big Coin, Inc., and Roche, together with co-defendant&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Randall Crater</strong></span><span>, one of the other co-defendants named in the CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint, operated a digital asset scheme in which they fraudulently offered the sale of a fully-functioning virtual currency, My Big Coin (MBC), a commodity in interstate commerce. The CFTC dismissed its enforcement action against named co-defendant&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Michael Kruger</strong></span><span>&nbsp;because of his death.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The defendants obtained more than $6 million from at least 28 customers through fraudulent solicitations, including false and misleading claims and omissions about MBC&rsquo;s value, usage, and trade status, and that MBC was backed by gold. Crater misappropriated virtually all the money solicited from customers, using those misappropriated funds wrongfully.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The order resolves the claims against Gillespie, Roche, My Big Coin Pay, Inc., and My Big Coin, Inc., in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action. [See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7678-18">7678-18</a><span>] The court had previously entered a consent order resolving the CFTC&rsquo;s claims against Crater, who is currently imprisoned for his role in the scheme. [See CFTC Press Release&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9051-25">9051-25</a><span>]</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span><strong>Parallel Criminal Action</strong></span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>On January 18, 2022, a grand jury returned an eight-count superseding indictment charging Crater with wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business based on the same conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s amended complaint. [United States v. Randall Crater, No. 1:19-cr-10063-DJC (D. Mass. Jan. 18, 2022)).] Crater was found guilty of those charges on July 21, 2022, and was sentenced to 100 months in prison and ordered to pay $7,668,317.50 in restitution to defrauded customers and to forfeit $7,668,317.50, which represented the proceeds he received from his violations.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the FBI.</span></p>
<p class="ReleaseID"><span>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Daniel Ullman II, Chrystal Gonnella, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Paul G. Hayeck, and former Division staff members Jonah E. McCarthy, Jason Mahoney, John Einstman, Hillary Van Tassel, Patricia Gomersall, and Kyong J. Koh.</span></p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On FINRA, MSRB Filings To Rescind 1-Minute Reporting Rules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today released the following statements on FINRA and the MSRB filings to rescind 1-minute reporting rules:</p>
<p>Leslie Norwood, managing director, associate general counsel and head of municipal securities, on the MSRB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msrb.org/Regulatory-Documents?id=14224">filing</a>&nbsp;to amend Rule G-14:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA strongly supports the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) amending its Rule G-14 to revert to 15-minute trade reporting.&nbsp; The fixed income markets&mdash;including the municipal securities market&mdash;remain predominantly over-the-counter, where elements of trading and post-execution processing rely on manual processes, or are subject to still developing and non-comprehensive automation.&nbsp; An across-the-board one-minute reporting requirement is not feasible due to the lack of full post-trade automation stemming from the importance of bilateral negotiation in many fixed income markets.&nbsp; We are also pleased to see the MSRB remove the manual trade flag and the two exceptions which were part of the recent revisions to the Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Killian, managing director, securitization and corporate credit, on FINRA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rule-filings/sr-finra-2025-008">proposed rule change</a>&nbsp;to amend Rule 6730:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA strongly supports FINRA amending its Rule 6730 to revert to 15-minute trade reporting, as this trade reporting framework appropriately balances the need for market transparency with the operational realities of the over-the-counter (OTC) fixed income markets. Unlike the centralized and highly automated equity markets, the fixed income markets depend heavily on manual or partially automated processes, including phone calls and chat-based communications. For many firms, particularly smaller ones, achieving one-minute reporting is either technologically unfeasible or financially burdensome.&nbsp; SIFMA also commends FINRA for removing the manual trade flag and the two exceptions previously introduced under the revised rule. These changes recognize the unique structure and functioning of the fixed income markets while maintaining the integrity and timeliness of market data. We will review the aspect of the proposal regarding reporting of allocation trades and provide comments to FINRA, but as an initial matter, are pleased to see FINRA&rsquo;s attention to this issue which has long burdened dual-registered firms.&nbsp; SIFMA remains committed to working with FINRA and other stakeholders to ensure a transparent, efficient, and resilient fixed income marketplace.&rdquo;</p>

<title>FIA: Adoption Of Tokenisation Beneficial For Cleared Derivatives Industry - FIA Sees Collateral Mobility As Important Use Case For Blockchain Technology</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fia-adoption-of-tokenisation-beneficial-for-cleared-derivatives-industry-fia-2025611/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fia-adoption-of-tokenisation-beneficial-for-cleared-derivatives-industry-fia-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FIA released a white paper on the potential application of tokenisation to accelerate the mobility of collateral in the cleared derivatives industry. &nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US"><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12KWwDjQ1Vxi2FPfAzEs0UpFE9zpHh">Read the paper</a><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12KWwDNuBZpZr2yS24s864oH4XSdua">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">The paper states that the cleared derivatives industry is at an "inflection point" in the adoption of tokenisation and notes that several clearinghouses are exploring use cases for this technology. It describes the potential benefits and&nbsp;some of the challenges for adoption at scale and concludes with four recommendations.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">&ldquo;Over the last several years, we have seen a growing recognition among our members that tokenisation could have a practical use case in how we manage the movement of collateral,&rdquo; said FIA president and CEO Walt Lukken. "By creating a digital representation of an asset on a distributed ledger, tokenisation can allow us to move collateral in close to real time. That can unlock liquidity and reduce risks and costs associated with traditional settlement processes."&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">The paper calls attention to four main benefits of tokenisation:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><ol start="1">
<li> It would increase the speed of asset transfers, especially for non-cash collateral, by cutting the settlement time from days to minutes.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li> It would allow for extended trading hours, including the potential for 24/7 trading, by decoupling the settlement system from the operational hours of traditional banking system payment rails.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="3">
<li> Using distributed ledger technology would reduce the errors that arise when each entity keeps its own record of the transaction on its own system and the inefficiencies that arise from the duplication of processes across financial institutions.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="4">
<li> It could help automate certain functions with "smart contracts," whereby code attached to the tokenised asset fulfils certain actions when specified conditions are met.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div>
<p>"Years of work on this technology are starting to bear fruit," said Will Acworth, global head of market intelligence. "We are seeing scepticism give way to genuine interest as firms see real-world benefits in terms of operational efficiency and real-time risk management. Although there are many issues that will need addressing before it can be deployed at scale, we think the time has come for both the industry and its regulators to recognize the benefits of technology and work together on adoption." &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p xml:lang="EN-US">The paper outlines four recommendations:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><ol start="1">
<li> The importance of education, and how FIA can play a supporting role by connecting experts in blockchain technology with the operations, risk, funding, compliance, legal and other professionals who manage the movement of collateral in today&rsquo;s technology systems.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li> Legal certainty will speed adoption. FIA has analysed the US regulatory landscape but more work is required across the globe to clarify whether existing rules permit tokenised assets for use as collateral.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="3">
<li> Adoption of this new technology should start with forms of collateral that meet existing regulatory standards for liquidity, such as certain government bonds and money market funds.&nbsp; </li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="4">
<li> Strong collaboration and industry standards will increase adoption. The movement of collateral involves many segments of the cleared derivatives ecosystem, including clearinghouses, clearing brokers, custodians, market participants, traditional technology providers and the next generation of blockchain network providers. One way to encourage adoption across this ecosystem is through pilot projects, tabletop exercises and other forms of collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's Statement Before The House Ways And Means Committee</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-secretary-scott-bessents-statement-before-the-house-ways-and-means-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Neal, and members of the committee&mdash;I&rsquo;m grateful to join you today. Treasury is committed to working with Congress to improve our nation&rsquo;s finances, create new jobs, and strengthen the economy. We look forward to coordinating with you on the President&rsquo;s Budget and his tax priorities in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As part of this effort, I wish to highlight today the Treasury Department&rsquo;s efforts to advance President Trump&rsquo;s economic agenda on tax and trade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pleased to report that Treasury has just completed its most successful tax filing season in years&mdash;and we did so while improving efficiencies and cutting costs at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics of the President&rsquo;s efforts to modernize the IRS warned that the effort would result in a 10% shortfall in receipts. Instead, the opposite happened. April receipts this year were up 9.5% over the previous year. And receipts in May were up 14.7% over the previous year. Most remarkably, the President was able to achieve these results while reducing $2 billion in waste and planned IT spending at the IRS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This success has taken place against the backdrop of one of the most consequential tax proposals ever to come before Congress: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This will provide individuals and businesses with certainty and build economic momentum. The legislation is squarely aimed at boosting the working and middle class and reinvigorating American manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Council of Economic Advisers, the One Big Beautiful Bill will raise take-home pay between $7,800 and $13,300 for the average family of four. It will increase wages between $6,100 to $11,600 for the average worker. And it will cement no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and tax cuts for seniors.</p>
<p>The One Big Beautiful Bill will also incentivize unprecedented investment in US manufacturing. The legislation will provide 100% expensing for new factories, as well as existing factories that expand operations and support Made-in-America. And it will streamline burdensome permitting processes that often stand in the way of new manufacturing projects. It&rsquo;s time for this country to start building things again&mdash;and the One Big Beautiful Bill makes this possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The administration is grateful for the leadership of this committee in shepherding the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House. We are now working closely with members of the Senate to get this legislation to the President&rsquo;s desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trade is the second topic I wish to highlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progress we have made on tax issues over the last four months complements the significant progress we have made in rebalancing the global economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I last testified before Congress in May, the President announced the historic US-UK trade deal. This arrangement&mdash;which creates a $5 billion export opportunity for American ranchers, farmers, and manufacturers&mdash;is a preview of what&rsquo;s to come. Dozens of countries have engaged the administration thus far with offers to improve their trade relations with the United States. This includes China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has a singular opportunity to stabilize its economy by shifting away from excess production towards greater consumption. But the country needs to be a reliable partner in trade negotiations. If China will course-correct by upholding its end of the initial trade agreement we outlined in Geneva last month, then a big, beautiful rebalancing of the world&rsquo;s two largest economies is possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By challenging the decades-old status quo on tax and trade, President Trump is breathing new life into the American economy. More than&nbsp;500,000 private-sector payroll&nbsp;jobs have been added since January. Most importantly, inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy. After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration&rsquo;s policies. Furthermore, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and plentiful labor demand as job openings remain high. This strength has been exemplified in the recent performance of the stock market and consumer confidence data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President&rsquo;s bold leadership on these issues has laid the foundation for a Golden Age economy. With your help, we can build on that foundation to create even greater prosperity and abundance for the American people. We hope you will join us in this endeavor.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>PIABA Praises SEC Investor Advisory Committee For Tackling Forced Arbitration By RIAs — But Urges Stronger Action</title>

<p class="s6"><span><span><span><span>The Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (PIABA) offered measured praise for the SEC Investor Advisory Committee for its new recommendations related to Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) arbitration.

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>&ldquo;PIABA joins with the financial industry in calling for more fairness and consistency,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><span>said Adam Gana<strong>&nbsp;</strong>president of PIABA and managing partner of Gana Weinstein LLP.&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Mandatory arbitration, as it stands today, often locks investors out of meaningful justice.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its inaugural collaboration with Hilton Capital Management LLC, culminating in the launch of the Solactive Hilton Capital BDC Corporate Bond TR Index. This first-of-its-kind index offers targeted exposure to fixed-income securities issued by U.S.-registered Business Development Companies (BDCs), aiming to provide investors with access to elevated yields within a regulated, investment-grade framework.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As investor interest in private credit continues to rise, BDC bonds present a compelling opportunity. These instruments consistently yield above average Baa-rated corporates<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hilton-capital-management-launches-hilton-bdc-corporate-bond-etf-tracking-solactive-hilton-capital-bdc-corporate-bond-tr-index/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>, delivering attractive income potential while generally maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. Furthermore, U.S. regulations require BDCs to maintain asset coverage of at least 150%, safeguarding bondholders by constraining leverage and ensuring structural risk discipline. Notably, BDCs boast a flawless repayment track record across more than 25 years of public &ldquo;baby bond&rdquo; issuance<span><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hilton-capital-management-launches-hilton-bdc-corporate-bond-etf-tracking-solactive-hilton-capital-bdc-corporate-bond-tr-index/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><a href="https://www.solactive.com/hilton-capital-management-launches-hilton-bdc-corporate-bond-etf-tracking-solactive-hilton-capital-bdc-corporate-bond-tr-index/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span>, underlining their stability and reliability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0FH00">Solactive Hilton Capital BDC Corporate Bond TR Index</a>&nbsp;methodology leverages this stability and upside by focusing exclusively on fixed-coupon bonds issued by BDCs listed in the annual Business Development Company Report published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). To ensure liquidity and quality, eligible bonds must have a minimum outstanding amount of USD 250 million and be priced by a designated price provider. Securities such as floating-rate notes, convertibles, inflation-linked, municipal, structured, or perpetual bonds are excluded. To avoid over-concentration, the index imposes a 10% cap per issuer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hilton BDC Corporate Bond ETF is listed on June 11<span>th</span>, 2025, on the Nasdaq with the ticker HBDC.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are thrilled to launch our first joint index with Hilton Capital Management, marking a new chapter in our collaboration. By translating the distinct income characteristics and regulatory structure of BDC bonds into a transparent, rules-based index, we aim to provide investors with a new tool for gaining exposure to the BDC bond universe. Furthermore, it enables access to the dynamics of the private-credit market through a well-regulated and transparent structure.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alex Oxenham, Chief Investment Officer at Hilton Capital Management, commented:&nbsp;</span><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to partner with Solactive on the Solactive Hilton Capital BDC Corporate Bond TR Index, a first-of-its-kind benchmark that passively seeks to unlock the yield premium of senior unsecured BDC bonds within a transparent, rules-based framework. By enforcing strict eligibility filters&mdash;$250 million minimum issue size, 10% issuer caps, and quarterly rebalancing&mdash;we&rsquo;ve created an ETF-ready vehicle offering daily liquidity and broad diversification across leading BDC issuers. This collaboration transforms an overlooked corner of the credit market into a scalable solution for insurers, pension funds, and income-focused investors seeking private credit exposure.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<title>Opening Remarks By Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets &amp; Development), Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI-ILSTC) Trade And Financial Conference On 11 June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information and Health, Mr Tan Kiat How,<br /><br />Chongqing Municipal People&rsquo;s Government Vice Mayor Xu Jian,<br /><br />His Excellency, Ambassador Cao Zhongming,<br /><br />Bank Indonesia Executive Director Pak Yoga Affandi,<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen,<br /><br />1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Singapore for the CCI-ILSTC Trade and Financial Conference. Today&rsquo;s Conference is especially meaningful for three reasons.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>First, it marks the 10th anniversary of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative or CCI. The value of the CCI as an important driver for cross-border connectivity cannot be understated. Since the CCI&rsquo;s inception, there has been sustained growth in trade volumes in both directions. And finance has been an important driver, with over US$21.69 billion in cross-border financing deals since the CCI&rsquo;s inception.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>Second, the Conference reflects strong interest and active participation of financial institutions from both sides, working hard on new areas to explore partnerships, and work on cross-border financing deals together. All this is taking place against the backdrop of expanding financial collaboration at the China-Singapore Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation which covers RMB cooperation, capital market connectivity, as well as digital and sustainable finance.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>Third, this Conference brings together, for the first time, the CCI Financial Summit and the CCI-ILSTC International Cooperation Forum. This new format seeks to bring our financial services and trade ecosystems even closer together, more effectively catalysing the discovery of new linkages and business opportunities. This is timely as ASEAN is also Chongqing&rsquo;s largest trading partner accounting for more than 16% of Chongqing&rsquo;s total trade.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;<span> </span>As CCI enters its next decade, we look to how Western China and ASEAN can deepen cooperation, harness key structural trends, and identify new opportunities in future-oriented areas such as green finance and digital connectivity. This will improve the quality and scope of cross-border financial services, enabling our financial sectors to better serve the real economy. In doing so, financial institutions can also help businesses with their green transition efforts and capitalise on digitalisation trends to enhance their business models.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span>Both China and ASEAN will require a vast amount of green financing and investments to transition our economies towards a sustainable, low carbon future.&nbsp;<br /><br />7.&nbsp;<span> </span>Banks from China and Singapore, together with the Singapore Exchange, have been engaging Chongqing corporates on green financing opportunities. For instance, last year, the EU, China and Singapore announced the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy, or M-CGT which enhances the comparability of green taxonomies across the EU, China and Singapore. With the M-CGT, corporates from the three regions will benefit from a common framework which aligns their green activities with international standards, making it easier to access cross-border green financing.&nbsp;<br /><br />8.&nbsp;<span> </span>Aside from capital markets, our financial institutions have also been active in supporting Chongqing&rsquo;s decarbonisation journey. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DBS Bank&rsquo;s provision of a green loan to Singapore Power Group in 2025, to support the district cooling and heating system project at Raffles City Chongqing. This will reduce its carbon footprint by about 30 percent.&nbsp;</li>
<li>OCBC Bank&rsquo;s arranging of a green syndicated loan for EBA Investments<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2025/opening-remarks-by-mr-leong-sing-chiong-at-the-cci-ilstc-conference#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;in 2024, for their Chongqing IMIX+ Project in the Chaotianmen Business District. This loan, which references internationally recognised Green Loan Principles, helps promote carbon neutrality for the project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span> </span>Meanwhile, digital technology has great potential to break down barriers and make cross-border trade simpler, more efficient, and potentially enhance SME trade connectivity between China and ASEAN.&nbsp;As SMS Tan mentioned in his remarks earlier, Proxtera's network of digital marketplaces will enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Chongqing and the Western Region to access a greater network of buyers and suppliers. The integration of trade discoverability and financing functions on the Proxtera platform can also help these SMEs overcome some of the challenges and complexities of cross-border trade as they seek to access new markets.<br /><br />10.&nbsp;<span> </span>In closing, there is much potential to further grow the trade and financial connectivity between Chongqing and ASEAN. Under the umbrella of the CCI, we hope to bring new ideas, innovations and initiatives that will ensure sustainable growth across our regions. This is in keeping with the JCBC objective of fostering an all-round, high-quality, future-oriented partnership.<br /><br />11.&nbsp;<span> </span>Thanks, and I wish you all a fruitful Conference for the rest of the day.</p>

<title>Opening Remarks At The ASIC Symposium On Australia’s Public And Private Markets, Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo, 10 June 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-at-the-asic-symposium-on-australias-public-and-private-markets-2025611/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/opening-remarks-at-the-asic-symposium-on-australias-public-and-private-markets-2025611/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The future direction of our public and private markets affects almost every Australian &ndash; and will undoubtedly help shape our economy.</li>
<li>We have a window of opportunity to design the public markets we want to see &ndash; and grease the wheels a bit to get public listings moving.</li>
<li>At the same time, we are at a turning point that could alter the trajectory of private markets to instil further market integrity and confidence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Good evening, everyone. It&rsquo;s good to see the room just about full.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you to ASIC&rsquo;s Symposium on Australia&rsquo;s Public and Private Markets and acknowledge all of our guests. This is the second symposium ASIC is doing, and I hope it will be a permanent feature of our work. Some of you might remember last year we did a symposium on AI &ndash; a subject we&rsquo;ll no doubt have to return to at some point.</p>
<p>Tonight, you&rsquo;ll be hearing from market participants interacting directly with ASIC to answer a very significant question &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>where do we go from here</strong>?</p>
<p>This question affects almost every Australian. Every worker saving for their future retirement. Every mum-and-dad investor trying to get ahead. And every entrepreneur with the next great idea.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s role in this discussion</h2>
<p>On that, many of our conversations have focused on whether ASIC has a role in regulating private markets. I want to be clear that ASIC is in no rush to regulate.</p>
<p>The intent of this work has always been to sharpen our understanding of private markets. The very significant capital in this part of the system is made up of Australians&rsquo; superannuation and insurance monies, so quite frankly it is in the public interest that ASIC take a closer look and lead the debate.</p>
<p>So far what we have heard is that there is an openness to increased supervision and consistent standard-setting across areas like valuations, managing conflicts of interest and fee disclosure.</p>
<p>But fundamentally we need to be very clear about the problem we are solving before jumping to regulation. I&rsquo;ve said many times before regulatory complexity is a problem in Australia, and we need to simplify our approach.</p>
<h2>Today ASIC is moving from listening mode to action mode</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that as a result of our consultation, there are many actionable ideas on the table.</p>
<p>Ideas to help make our markets more open, more accessible, and more attractive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now looking at which ones we can bring to the front burner to fuel growth and activity in our markets. We&rsquo;re moving from listening to action.</p>
<p>This morning&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/" title="25-096MR ASIC clears path for faster IPOs">announcement about changes to the IPO process</a>&nbsp;is an example &ndash; and I hope the beginning of several more.</p>
<p>This change reflects feedback that while our regulatory guardrails are sound, it&rsquo;s time to grease the wheels a bit to get public listings moving.</p>
<p>So, we are creating a more streamlined IPO process which reduces the execution risks associated with listing.</p>
<p>The trial will commence immediately, and I&rsquo;m pleased to say we&rsquo;ve already received enquiries from interested parties.</p>
<p>While regulatory settings aren&rsquo;t a silver bullet, I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to mobilise our teams on simple, common-sense solutions supported by industry &ndash; and there&rsquo;ll be more to come.</p>
<p>I should call out, by the way, the various people in the market who worked so closely with ASIC to get us to where we were this morning. There&rsquo;s a lot of goodwill and professionalism reflected in that engagement.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage and work with industry, Treasury, our peers at other Australian regulators &ndash; some of whom are here tonight &ndash; and broader stakeholders.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to next steps, we&rsquo;ll share our views on how to strengthen our public markets during quarter three of this year.</p>
<p>And in quarter four we&rsquo;ll announce our proposed roadmap for private markets.</p>
<p>This work will be supported in the coming months by our ongoing surveillances, views from market experts and ongoing stakeholder feedback.</p>
<p>To wrap up.</p>
<p>While many of the responses to our discussion paper focused on the here and now, it is critical that we keep an eye on the medium to longer term horizon.</p>
<p>This could be a watershed moment for Australia&rsquo;s markets.</p>
<p>We have a window of opportunity to design the public markets we want to see, not just tomorrow but in five- and 10-years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re at a turning point that could alter the trajectory of private markets to instil further market integrity and confidence.</p>
<p>From here on, our work must look ahead.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a modern, confident, ambitious regulator, ASIC is proud to be leading these issues of the day which will undoubtedly help shape Australia&rsquo;s economy, so that it is fit for the future.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to this evening&rsquo;s discussions. Thank you.</p>

It is therefore still being tested at this initial stage of application and it may be too early to objectively analyse its implications. Nevertheless, there is a majority support within the EACH Membership in favour of a more centralised supervision for CCPs in the EU to different degrees, although certain CCPs have expressed support towards the EMIR 3 status quo. EACH Members would also like to caution against models such as regional supervisory hubs or establishing supervisory colleges with enhanced powers.</li>
<li><b>Recommendations on possible streamlining and simplification of EU law</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH supports removing overlapping reporting requirements between different legislations such as EMIR, REMIT, MAR, MiFID and MiFIR, as well as ensuring a level playing field between EU and non-EU CCPs and non-centrally cleared markets, especially in the context of requirements concerning e.g. anti-procyclicality and margin transparency. EACH also calls for the implementation of the appropriate measures to incentivise clearing by fund managers, insurers and public entities, as well as a reflection on how the principle of proportionality is applied in the context of the DORA framework. Furthermore, Members put forward detailed proposals linked to the ESMA Draft RTS on EMIR 3 approval procedures, underlining the need for leaner and clearer processes.</li>
<li><b>Lowering barriers in post-trading</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members propose to create incentives for the missing Member States and market participants to migrate flows to T2S. Furthermore, we suggest a series of changes to the SFD and FCD legislations to address specific issues concerning the clearing sector such as need to ensure protection under the SFD for all CCPs/clearing houses for their default management rules and procedures, as well as the necessity to expand the list of collateral eligible under the FCD to cover all assets acceptable as collateral.</li>
<li><b>Outsourcing and DLT</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH calls for a clear guidance based on existing rules in the context of outsourcing, and provides an analysis of the advantages and drawbacks&nbsp;regarding the use of DLT in the clearing sector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, pending the crucial final publication of the ESMA RTS about the approval procedures for products and changes to risk models, the EMIR 3 level 1 text has represented a major step forward in reducing unnecessary regulatory burden for the market while maintaining financial stability safeguards. The SIU project may be inspired by the achievements of the EMIR 3 level 1 text.</p>

<title>ISDA: Creating Value – IQ June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ever since its establishment 40 years ago, ISDA has worked to enhance the safety and efficiency of derivatives markets. That has motivated everything we do &ndash; from the development of standard documentation and the rollout of new digital solutions to our responses to regulatory consultations.</p>
<p>In our view, safe and efficient markets are critical prerequisites for liquidity and competition &ndash; and that matters. Without deep and liquid markets, it would be more difficult and expensive for corporations, governments, pension funds and insurance companies to use derivatives to transfer unwanted risks, enhance returns and manage their liquidity needs.</p>
<p>The impact of that would be significant. According to a new ISDA report on the value of derivatives, 87.1% of nearly 1,200 major companies in seven major stock indices use over-the-counter derivatives for a variety of reasons, including locking in financing terms, reducing costs and enhancing financial performance. This helps create predictability, which gives companies the<br />confidence to borrow, invest and hire.</p>
<p>In this issue of IQ, we spotlight that report and explore how and why different types of firms use derivatives and the value they bring to individual companies and the broader economy.</p>
<p>The report was published to coincide with ISDA&rsquo;s 40th anniversary, and we continue our&nbsp;<span>IQ</span>&nbsp;anniversary series by looking at how ISDA and its members have worked to address some of the biggest challenges ever to face derivatives markets &ndash; from the rollout of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives to the transition from LIBOR. The solutions that were developed &ndash; the ISDA<br />Standard Initial Margin Model and the IBOR fallbacks &ndash; are great examples of ISDA fulfilling its core mission: maintaining the safety and efficiency of derivatives markets.</p>
<p>This issue also includes a review of ISDA&rsquo;s 39th Annual General Meeting, which took place in Amsterdam last month, with nearly 800 delegates from around the world. The flagship event was an opportunity to reflect on ISDA&rsquo;s achievements over the past 40 years and to consider the future trends that will shape the derivatives market. Save the date for ISDA&rsquo;s 40th AGM, which will take place in Boston on April 28-30, 2026.</p>

This milestone marks the debut of the first national securities exchange designed for global access and approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer 23-hour weekday trading of U.S. equities.</p>
<p>Beginning on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 29</span>, 24X National Exchange will offer trading of U.S. equities from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET</span>&nbsp;on weekdays.</p>
<p>The new Exchange will enable both institutional and retail investors anywhere in the world to trade U.S. equities via participating broker-dealers across nearly the entire day, five days a week. It will operate under full SEC regulatory oversight and with all the standard investor protections afforded to national exchanges.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange will focus its initial efforts on meeting the growing demand for overnight trading in U.S. equities among tech savvy retail investors throughout the APAC region.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange CEO and Founder&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Dmitri Galinov</span>&nbsp;said: "We're proud to lead the next chapter in exchange evolution as we bring extended hours trading to retail traders around the world. With this first stage launch, we're one big step closer to making 23-hour weekday trading a reality for U.S. equities worldwide. 24X National Exchange will enable unprecedented access, flexibility, and speed for market participants in every global location whenever they want to trade.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange received SEC approval last November to operate 23/5 trading hours, subject to the implementation of necessary modifications to Equity Data Plans and a subsequent rule filing with the SEC confirming compliance with the Securities Exchange Act.</p>
<p>Pending final approvals and market infrastructure alignment, 24X National Exchange will transition to operating from&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday</span>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">8:00 p.m. ET on Friday</span>, with a one-hour daily operational pause for software maintenance and testing. The launch date for the Exchange's second stage will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>"The initial launch of 24X National Exchange is the culmination of years of innovation, regulatory engagement, and commitment to global market access," Galinov added. "Setting the launch date for our new Exchange is a defining moment &ndash; not just for our company, but for the future of U.S. equity trading."</p>
<p>24X National Exchange is built on a robust, high-performance technology infrastructure powered by MEMX Technologies, ensuring a seamless, resilient, and cost-effective trading experience.</p>
<p>Like NYSE and NASDAQ, 24X National Exchange will observe U.S. market holidays.</p>

<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, an LSEG business, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stepstonegroup.com/">StepStone</a>&nbsp;announced today they have signed a proposed partnership to jointly develop private asset indices, data, and analytics products.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>The proposed partnership will combine FTSE Russell&rsquo;s expertise in design, development, calculation and management&nbsp;of category defining indices across asset classes, with StepStone&rsquo;s leading private markets solutions platform and deep data driven insights across multiple private market asset classes.</p>
<p>The partnership encompasses the development and delivery of market leading reference indices for a full spectrum of private asset allocations, allowing asset owners to better benchmark the performance of private markets portfolios within a total &ldquo;real return&rdquo; portfolio view and asset managers to develop products tracking these daily indices.</p>
<p>FTSE Russell and StepStone expect the initial cohort of daily indices to be launched this year, with further indices and supporting analytical tools to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Fiona Bassett, CEO, FTSE Russell, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our agreement with StepStone and its intended delivery of private asset indices and benchmarking tools further strengthens FTSE Russell&rsquo;s position as a leading multi-asset class index and benchmark provider. With the continued growth in private asset allocation and growing client demand, it is essential for us not only to deliver leading indices in this asset class but to work with partners aligned to our commitment to transparency, rules-based methodologies, robust data provenance and investability. With StepStone&rsquo;s broad, in-depth private markets dataset, we have chosen a great partner with which to build this offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mike McCabe, Head of Strategy, StepStone, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As private markets have become more meaningful components of investors&rsquo; portfolios, the need for integrating views of risk and return across the total portfolio has become critical for investment decision makers.&nbsp; With a growing portion of the global economy remaining private not only for longer, but potentially indefinitely, we need to pave a pathway for further easing the access to differentiated sources of investment returns.&nbsp; Partnering with FTSE Russell will unleash the power and scale of our private markets data &ndash; contained within our proprietary technology platform, SPI by StepStone &ndash; to drive these goals forward.&nbsp; FTSE Russell&rsquo;s leading index, benchmarking and technology platform underpinned by its client-centered approach gives us confidence that in partnering we can deliver a solution that is consistent with our mission to be the trusted partner of choice in private markets solutions globally.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission: Kevin Carmichael Sentenced To Four Years For Defrauding Strike Holdings Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announces that Mr. Kevin Carmichael has been sentenced to four years in jail for defrauding investors in Strike Holdings Inc., as well as making misleading statements to investors and trading securities without registration. In addition to the jail term, Mr. Carmichael was also ordered to pay restitution to harmed investors totaling $22.7 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael was a director and officer of both Strike Holdings and a related company, KM Strike Management (KMSM). He entered a guilty plea in the Ontario Court of Justice on January 8, 2025.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carmichael&rsquo;s actions had a profound impact on investors, creating stress and hardship in the lives of hard-working people who put their trust in him,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President, Enforcement, at the OSC. &ldquo;Misleading investors through falsified reports is illegal, and the OSC will continue to take action to protect investors, and the integrity of our capital markets. We also want to thank the Halton Region Police Service for their support on this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael was co-accused with Michael Aonso, the other director and officer of Strike Holdings and KMSM. Mr. Carmichael and Mr. Aonso were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/michael-aonso-and-kevin-carmichael-charged-securities-act-offences">charged in March 2022</a>. Mr. Aonso pleaded guilty in November 2024 to unregistered trading and illegal distribution of securities. Mr. Aonso will appear in the Ontario Court of Justice on September 23, 2025, for sentencing.</p>
<p>This case was brought by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. To do this, they often partner and collaborate with other law enforcement agencies and police forces. The OSC gratefully acknowledges the investigative support of the Halton Regional Police Service in this matter.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>
<h4>Background:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In June 2019, knowing Strike&rsquo;s TD accounts held only about USD $230,000, Carmichael approached TD Bank and claimed Strike had USD $97M on deposit. He provided forged statements to TD Bank in support of the claim that TD had lost the funds through fraud or error. In early 2021, Strike raised over $900,000 by issuing a debenture to fund litigation against TD Bank to &ldquo;recover&rdquo; the $97M. Carmichael participated in the debenture raise knowing he had forged the documents on which the proposed litigation was based.</li>

<title>EBA Publishes No Action Letter On The Interplay Between Payment Services Directive (PSD2/3) And Markets In Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a&nbsp;No Action letter advising the EU Commission, EU Council and EU Parliament to ensure that, in the long term, EU law needs to avoid a dual authorisation under two pieces of EU law for the activity of transacting electronic money tokens (EMTs). While the existing Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) still applies, the letter advises national competent authorities (NCAs) to enforce authorisation of PSD2 for a specified subset only of crypto asset service providers (CASPs) that transact EMTs, to do so only after a transition period that ends on 2 March 2026, and then to deprioritise specified PSD2 provisions.</span></p>
<p>The letter assesses the provisions set out in MiCA and PSD2 and advises NCAs under PSD2 to view the transfer of crypto assets as a payment service under PSD2 where they&nbsp;entail EMTs and are carried out by the entities on behalf of their clients. It sets out provisions&nbsp;to regard the custody and administration of EMTs as a payment service and to regard a custodial wallet as a payment account where the wallet is held in the name of one or more clients and allows to send and receive EMTs to and from third parties.</p>
<p>For these services, the No Action letter advises NCAs to require an authorisation under PSD2 only from 2 March 2026 onwards and, during the authorisation process, to apply streamlined procedures that make maximum use of information that legal entities provide during their CASP authorisation process.</p>
<p>Once an authorisation as a payment services provider is held, NCAs are advised not to prioritise the supervision and enforcement of several elements of PSD2, such as safeguarding, the disclosure of information to consumers (pertaining to the level of applicable charges, the maximum execution time of payment transactions, the unique identifier such as IBAN, and open banking). However, NCAs are also advised to insist on the compliance with other PSD2 provisions, such as strong customer authentication (SCA) for&nbsp;accessing custodial wallets that qualify as&nbsp;payment account&nbsp;and the initiating of EMT transfers, the reporting of payment fraud,&nbsp;and the cumulative calculation of own funds requirements. This is to ensure equally high standards of consumer protection regardless of whether a consumer is using EMTs or more traditional funds as a means of payment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, NCAs are advised not to consider as payment services (and therefore not to subject to the application of PSD2, including its provisions on licensing)&nbsp;the &lsquo;exchange of crypto-assets for funds&rsquo; and &lsquo;exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets&rsquo; as defined in MiCA. Additionally,&nbsp;the EBA advises NCAs&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to regard as a payment service cases where&nbsp;crypto-asset service providers intermediate the purchase of any crypto-assets with EMTs, and,&nbsp;therefore,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to enforce the application of PSD2 nor to require an authorisation under PSD2 in such cases.</p>
<p>This advice will result in a large number of EMT transactions not&nbsp;being subject to&nbsp;PSD2 requirements during the intervening period while the Directive still applies.&nbsp;The EBA bases this advice solely on the acknowledgement that any alternative advice would require a much larger number of CASPs to obtain a second authorization. The&nbsp;EBA considers such an alternative to be undesirable, given the&nbsp;burden that dual authorisation would impose on CASPs.</p>
<p>By contrast, the EBA does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;base this advice on the conviction that an authorisation as a CASP under MiCA is sufficient to address the risks that arise from EMT transactions. On the contrary, the success of PSD1, PSD2 and EMD over the past 15 years in bringing about a secure and competitive market for payment services in the EU has shown that for retail payments to be able effectively to fulfil their role in a modern society, consumers and other market actors should be adequately protected and have a high degree of confidence in the stability of the market and the reliability of payment transactions.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has issued the letter in response to a request received from the European Commission in December 2024 to address, in close cooperation with ESMA, issues arising from the interplay between MiCA and PSD2.&nbsp;The EBA&rsquo;s competence to deliver the letter in the form of an Opinion is based on Article 9c of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.</p>

<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning five individuals and five sham charities located abroad that are prominent financial supporters of Hamas&rsquo;s Military Wing and its terrorist activities.&nbsp; The individuals and entities sanctioned today are responsible for funding Hamas&rsquo;s Military Wing under the pretense of conducting humanitarian work, both internationally and in Gaza. &nbsp;Treasury is also targeting a separate fraudulent charity linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>As outlined in&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2F136%2F2024-National-Terrorist-Financing-Risk-Assessment.pdf/1/010101975a41d8d8-706dfc65-6d2c-4d5b-8deb-e69819b0abf7-000000/5VCJI0l_ZrVr3Uh7vFrSPxBJLYI18p3QZcHJqKdSyXI=408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Treasury&rsquo;s 2024 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment</span></a><span>, terrorist financing risks still exist primarily in the context of sham charities abroad.&nbsp; This includes terrorist networks that establish seemingly legitimate charitable non-profit organizations (NPOs) under the guise of providing humanitarian assistance but instead are primarily utilized for funneling money to terrorist organizations.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action underscores the importance of safeguarding the charitable sector from abuse by terrorists like Hamas and the PFLP, who continue to leverage sham charities as fronts for funding their terrorist and military operations,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender</strong>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Treasury will continue to use all available tools to prevent Hamas, the PFLP, and other terrorist actors from exploiting the humanitarian situation in Gaza to fund their violent activities at the expense of their own people.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Today&rsquo;s action, which is being taken pursuant to the counterterrorism authority in Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, highlights the abuse of the nonprofit sector by terrorist financiers to illicitly generate, store, and move funds.&nbsp; The PFLP was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. Department of State in October 1997 and October 2001, respectively. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span face="times new roman,times"><strong><span>TERRORISTS&rsquo; EXPLOITATION OF THE NPO SECTOR</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Hamas and the PFLP have long abused the trust of the international community and public support for legitimate humanitarian causes to fund their terrorist activities and bring violence to the Israeli and Palestinian people. &nbsp;As Hamas continues to hold hostages, including two American citizens, following the October 7, 2023 attack, Treasury remains committed to exposing terrorists and terrorist organizations that seek to abuse the NPO sector to raise funds under the fa&ccedil;ade of humanitarian support.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>This helps reduce the overall terrorist financing risk of the NPO sector by publicly identifying financing networks in support of terrorist organizations and activities. &nbsp;For more information about how Hamas finances its terrorist activities, see the&nbsp;</span><span>Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fincen.gov%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2023-10%2FFinCEN_Alert_Terrorist_Financing_FINAL508.pdf/1/010101975a41d8d8-706dfc65-6d2c-4d5b-8deb-e69819b0abf7-000000/3zxnFPWGIwWSXu8opJlaU63U_QsHncFMf_d5kpgaLqo=408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Alert to Financial Institutions to Counter Financing to Hamas and its Terrorist Activities</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><strong><span>HAMAS AND PFLP FUNDRAISING SCHEMES</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>Hamas and the PFLP have a long history of abusing the NPO and charitable sectors. &nbsp;Some of these NPOs and charities are entirely co-opted and run by these designated terrorists, with their links to Hamas and the PFLP intentionally obscured in order to evade sanctions.&nbsp; This allows Hamas and the PFLP to exploit the sympathy and generosity of the international public at the expense of the Palestinian people.</span></span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times"><span>The Gaza-based charity<strong>&nbsp;Al Weam Charitable Society&nbsp;</strong>(Al Weam) is clandestinely controlled by Hamas and fully integrated into Hamas&rsquo;s military wing.&nbsp; This secrecy has allowed Al Weam to raise funds and implement projects by international donors, many of whom are unwitting</span><span>of the organization&rsquo;s ties to Hamas.&nbsp; Al Weam has also employed Hamas members throughout the organization, including its Chairman of the Board of Directors,&nbsp;<strong>Muhammad Sami Muhammad Abu Marei&nbsp;</strong>(Abu Marei), who is a Hamas military operative and facilitated fundraising on behalf of Hamas using Al Weam.</span></span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Natasha Vij Greiner, Director of the Division of Investment Management, will depart the agency effective July 4, 2025, after more than 23 years of public service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natasha&rsquo;s steadfast leadership and strong judgment have been invaluable assets to the SEC throughout her long and distinguished career,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;I am grateful for her strategic counsel since I&rsquo;ve become Chairman. Her unwavering commitment to the agency&rsquo;s mission and her ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes with clarity will have a lasting effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management's work is critical to ensuring that investors have access to high-quality investment opportunities from which they can make well-informed investing decisions. It has primary responsibility for administering the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which includes overseeing investment companies (e.g., mutual funds, closed-end funds, business development companies, unit investment trusts, variable insurance products, and exchange-traded funds) and investment advisers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I reflect on my 23 years at the SEC, I am filled with gratitude for the incredible journey across the divisions of Investment Management, Enforcement, Examinations, and Trading and Markets,&rdquo; said Ms. Greiner. &ldquo;It has been an extraordinary privilege to serve in various capacities at the SEC, culminating as Director of the Division of Investment Management. Throughout my tenure, I have witnessed firsthand the dedication and integrity of the staff that define this remarkable agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. Greiner was named Director of the Division of Investment Management in March 2024. She previously served as Deputy Director of the Division of Examinations and as the National Associate Director of the Investment Adviser/Investment Company examination program, which includes the Private Funds Unit, and was the Associate Director of the Home Office IA/IC examination program.</p>
<p>She began her SEC career in the Division of Examinations (formerly OCIE) as a broker-dealer examiner and has served in a variety of roles across the agency, including Acting Chief Counsel and Assistant Chief Counsel in the Division of Trading and Markets, where she provided legal and policy advice to the Commission on rules affecting market participants and the operation of the securities markets. Before that, Ms. Greiner worked in the Division of Enforcement, including in its Asset Management Unit, where she investigated possible violations of the federal securities laws and litigated matters in federal district court and administrative proceedings.</p>
<p>Throughout her career at the SEC, Ms. Greiner has been consistently recognized for her outstanding achievements and efforts. She received the Chairman&rsquo;s Award for Excellence in 2015 and again in 2018, and she received the Chairman&rsquo;s Award for Serving the Interests of Main Street Investors in 2019.</p>
<p>Ms. Greiner received her J.D. from The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law and graduated cum laude with a B.S. degree from James Madison University.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it will immediately resume processing new and pending registration applications of investment advisers with their principal office and place of business in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement follows successful discussions between staff from the SEC and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regarding (1) the ability of FINMA-supervised, SEC-registered investment advisers located in Switzerland to provide their books and records, including personal data, directly to SEC staff, and (2) the SEC&rsquo;s ability to conduct on-site visits of these entities in Switzerland, consistent with the U.S. securities laws and Swiss law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased to announce that the SEC stands ready to provide prompt consideration of the registration applications from Swiss investment advisers. These applications have languished for too many years, and it is well past time that we resume this process,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;Longstanding interest from foreign investment advisers in registration demonstrates the value of the U.S. regulatory framework, and we look forward to expanding access to U.S. capital markets. I thank my FINMA counterparts for their collaboration and welcome their actions to make this possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The companies listed on BME's growth markets (<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx">BME Growth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup</a>) have once again demonstrated their growth capacity, with a compound annual growth rate of 27.7% in their revenue over the past ten years. This data consolidates the role of these markets as key platforms for driving the development of innovative and high-potential companies in Spain. In the last year, the turnover of these companies grew by 6.5%.<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx"></a></p>
<p>The expanding companies, a segment that includes the companies with the highest projection within these markets, have recorded even more notable growth, with an annualized increase of 30.6% in their revenue over the same period.</p>

<p>In terms of operating profitability, the total EBITDA of BME Growth and Scaleup companies has grown by 23% annually over the last decade, and by 23.3% in the last year alone.

<p>All of this has occurred in a context marked by high uncertainty stemming from the international geopolitical environment, which has affected financial markets, supply chains, and financing costs.

<p>These data consolidate BME Growth and Scaleup as reference environments for companies seeking financing, visibility, and professionalization on their path towards sustainable growth.</p>
<p>The growth markets of BME welcomed 23 new companies last year and so far in 2025, another five have already debuted.</p>

<h4><b>KEY FINDINGS INCLUDE</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>A weaker US Dollar, stable oil prices, and dovish fiscal policy in China and Europe provides a positive back drop for Emerging Markets</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Companies in China and India are driving innovation, benefiting from consumption-led growth across Emerging Markets and beyond</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Latin American equity and bonds, supported by attractive valuations, stand to benefit from United States strategic retrenchment</b></li>

<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Pedestrian index returns over the past 15 years underline the importance of investing actively in these markets</b></li>
</ul>
<p>On Thursday 5 June, Aubrey Capital Management (&ldquo;Aubrey&rdquo;) and LarrainVial hosted a high-level investment seminar in London, bringing together investment professionals, economists, policymakers and clients to examine how shifting global power dynamics are reshaping the investment opportunity in Emerging Markets.</p>
<p>The event,&nbsp;<i>Navigating Shifting Narratives in Emerging Markets</i>, featured presentations from Louis-Vincent Gave, Co-Founder and CEO of Gavekal, John Ewart, Investment Manager (Aubrey), Camila Guzm&aacute;n, Portfolio Manager (LarrainVial Asset Management), and former Chilean Finance Minister, Ignacio Briones. The speakers were joined in discussions by Aubrey&rsquo;s Founder and Investment Manager, Andrew Dalrymple, and Fernando Larra&iacute;n C.,<b>&nbsp;</b>President of LarrainVial. Anna Macdonald, Head of Private Clients at Aubrey, moderated the seminar.</p>
<p>Louis-Vincent Gave opened the event by framing 2025 as a year of global inflection, reflecting on the rise of &ldquo;Fortress America&rdquo;. John Ewart provided a company-level view of the opportunities in Emerging Markets, focusing on Asia. He emphasised the growth of domestic consumption in countries like India and China and presented several examples of world-class businesses in areas such as electric vehicles, e-commerce and fintech. Camila Guzm&aacute;n offered a strong case for Latin American Equities, describing the region as &ldquo;under-owned, undervalued, and under-touched.&rdquo; Former Chilean Finance Minister Ignacio Briones gave a detailed presentation on Chile&rsquo;s recent pension reform, which was passed earlier this year after more than a decade of political debate.</p>
<p>The seminar took place in the historic Livery Hall of the City of London&rsquo;s Guildhall, and was attended by over 130 people representing financial institutions, pension funds, wealth managers, intermediaries and consultants, who braved the London weather. Representatives from the UK and Chilean governments were also present, led by Lord Roger Liddle, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Trade Envoy for the Andean region, and Her Excellency Ximena Fuentes, Ambassador of Chile to the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Rings Bell On New Type Of Private Stock Market In Growth Boost</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>A new type of private stock market will be launched later in 2025 after the FCA announced the final rules for its Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System (PISCES).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>PISCES is a new type of platform where shares in private companies can be traded. It will open the door to more opportunities for investors, facilitating their access to growth companies. Private companies can tap into a broader range of investors and asset managers and PISCES offers exits for shareholders to sell up.</p>
<p>As companies choose to stay private for longer, there is demand for investors to trade private company shares easily and efficiently in an organised marketplace. PISCES meets this demand by allowing secondary trading of these shares. Companies can set the floor and ceiling of share prices, and have a say over who can buy their shares.</p>
<p>Access to PISCES will be limited to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, sophisticated investors and employees of participating companies. Investors will be provided with information about the risks involved to help them make informed decisions.</p>
<p>As set out in the FCA&rsquo;s letter to the PM outlining the regulator&rsquo;s approach to support growth, PISCES can unlock capital investment and liquidity.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This bold design rebalances risk, but it is bold risk-taking that made the UK the leading financial centre it is today. The new platforms will give investors greater access and confidence to invest in exciting new companies, while early backers and employees can sell up and invest again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;PISCES is the latest step in the FCA&rsquo;s wide-ranging reforms to the UK&rsquo;s markets to boost growth and competitiveness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emma Reynolds, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:</p>
<p>'PISCES is a great example of industry, regulators and the government working together to go further and faster on innovative reforms to strengthen UK capital markets, supporting economic growth and putting more money in people&rsquo;s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.</p>
<p>'I welcome the FCA's announcement, which follows our legislation and opens PISCES to industry. This also builds on our announcements on a stamp taxes on shares exemption for PISCES transactions, and on employees retaining the tax advantages on eligible shares traded.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the Policy Statement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp24-29-private-intermittent-securities-and-capital-exchange-system" title="PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox arrangements">PS25/6: Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System: Sandbox Arrangements</a>&nbsp;(June 2025).</li>
<li>The platform will be delivered through a sandbox, which will allow the FCA to test the design before finalising a permanent regime in 2030. The sandbox is now open, with shares likely to be traded later in 2025. Trading systems could include periodic auctions, as well as occasional and time-limited periods of continuous trading.</li>
<li>PISCES will be developed using a financial markets infrastructure (FMI) sandbox. This will be the second use of the FMI Sandbox powers after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-12-digital-securities-sandbox-joint-policy-statement-final-guidance" title="PS24/12: Digital Securities Sandbox joint Policy Statement and Final Guidance">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>.</li>

<li>The sandbox environment will allow government and regulators to check it is working properly. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Firms wishing to run a PISCES platform will have to apply to the FCA, and once approved will be able to run intermittent trading events. The FCA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/update-pisces-pre-application-support" title="Update on PISCES and pre-application support">pre-application support</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/pisces/sandbox-apply-run-platform" title="PISCES Sandbox: apply to run a platform">application support</a>&nbsp;for firms interested in applying to be a PISCES operator.</li>
<li>The regulator and government will use any lessons from the sandbox period to improve the regime before making it permanent.&nbsp;</li>

<p>This latest transaction brings the Bank&rsquo;s total outstanding on Nasdaq Dubai to USD 2.5 billion across five listings.

Ahmed Saad, DCEO of Sharjah Islamic Bank rang the market opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai in the presence of Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>

<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM,</b> said: "This listing reflects more than capital raising &mdash;it's part of a broader shift as regional institutions like Sharjah Islamic Bank lead the deepening of local debt markets.

<title>ASIC Clears Path For Faster IPOs</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos-2025610/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos-2025610/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Entities listing on the ASX via the fast-track process now have access to a shorter initial public offering (IPO) timetable designed to reduce deal execution risk as part of a two-year trial announced by ASIC today.</p>
<p>ASIC will now informally review eligible offer documents two weeks prior to public lodgement, which could reduce the IPO timetable by up to a week.</p>
<p>The changes mean ASIC will engage with an issuer prior to the exposure period, which decreases the need for supplementary and replacement documents and extensions to the exposure period. This also reduces the risk that market volatility and consequential pricing changes may impact investor interest in the IPO.</p>
<p>The changes also include a &lsquo;no action&rsquo; position by ASIC that now allows eligible companies to accept retail investor applications during the public exposure period for new listings, cutting down the administrative timeline of the IPO process.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the initiatives had been developed in response to the decline in Australian IPOs and public companies, highlighted in ASIC&rsquo;s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/dp-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-a-discussion-paper-on-the-dynamics-between-public-and-private-markets/" title="DP Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets">discussion paper on the evolving dynamics between public and private markets</a>, and form part of the agency&rsquo;s regulatory simplification focus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Creating a more streamlined IPO process underscores our commitment to ensuring our public markets remain attractive to companies and investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Greater deal certainty for companies should help deliver more IPOs, which means more investment opportunities so companies can expand, increase jobs and ultimately economic growth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our initial public offerings are the lowest they have been in over a decade, and companies are de-listing. Meanwhile, our secondary capital raising settings continue to be globally recognised for their speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earlier this year, we outlined our concerns for the future of public markets and called for actionable ideas to ensure our markets remain open, efficient and attractive to investors. I'm proud of how quickly we've been able to work with industry participants and mobilise our teams to respond to actionable ideas.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we do not see regulatory settings as the silver bullet, we have received lots of ideas and are considering further regulatory adjustments to support a strong and well-functioning market,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>The changes still allow for concerns to be raised during the public exposure period and the issue of shares and quotation will still only occur once the exposure period has ended.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s new approach comes into effect today, and is the first in a series of regulatory changes it is considering to enhance and improve the attractiveness of Australia&rsquo;s public markets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On 26 February 2025, ASIC released a discussion paper which explored the changing dynamics in capital markets in Australia and abroad, including declining listings on public markets, the rapid growth in investment capital allocated to private markets and the growing significance of superannuation funds in markets.</p>
<h2>Trial process</h2>
<p>The trial process is available to entities seeking the ASX fast-track listing (Eligible Entities / Eligible Companies) as part of a two-year trial starting today. ASX Fast-track is available to entities that will have a market capitalisation greater than $100 million upon listing and no ASX imposed escrow.</p>
<p>Eligible Entities can provide a pathfinder prospectus or pathfinder PDS to ASIC on a confidential basis, at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement for review. A pathfinder prospectus or PDS is a draft document distributed to professional or sophisticated investors which does not seek subscriptions from retail investors and is designed to facilitate the pricing of securities.</p>
<p>ASIC will endeavour to complete its review of the Pathfinder in the 14-day period prior to formal lodgement. ASIC will then generally not need to extend the 7-day exposure period to 14 days after lodgement other than where material new information comes to light or is included in the lodged prospectus / PDS. ASIC will retain its ability to use stop orders up until listing.</p>
<h2>Conditions of trial</h2>
<ul>
<li>The entity must be eligible for the ASX Fast Track application process.</li>
<li>Entities must email the Pathfinder to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:prelodgement@asic.gov.au">prelodgement@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;at least 14 days prior to formal lodgement.</li>
<li>The Pathfinder must not differ in any material respect from the lodged prospectus / PDS other than for final pricing, offer amount and related metrics / financial information and as otherwise agreed with ASIC.</li>
<li>Normal ASIC review processes may apply in situations where there is an extended delay between the informal review completing and formal lodgement.</li>
<li>A Pathfinder review by ASIC does not endorse the contents of the Pathfinder or preclude ASIC or a third party from taking action in respect of the lodged prospectus / PDS or the offer it contains.</li>
<li>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the trial at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ASIC no-action position</h2>
<p>ASIC is also announcing a class no-action position where an Eligible Company accepts an application during the exposure period. This aligns the process for prospectuses with PDSs, simplifying the process by removing the need to wait for the exposure period to lapse.</p>
<p>ASIC does not intend to take action for a contravention of subsections 727(3) or (6) of the Corporations Act where a person accepts an application for non-quoted securities offered under a disclosure document during the period referred to in subsection 727(3) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s no-action position applies only to the offers of non-quoted securities under a disclosure document issued by an Eligible Company in accordance with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act made during the trial period.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s general policy on &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; positions also applies. Their status is set out in Regulatory Guide 108&nbsp;<em>No-action letters</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-108-no-action-letters/" title="RG 108 No-action letters">RG 108</a>). In particular, it should be noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>a no-action letter is an expression of regulatory intention about how to exercise ASIC&rsquo;s powers. The purpose of a no-action letter is to provide an indication as to the future regulatory action that we might take. Entities do not need to apply to ASIC to avail themselves of this no-action position.</li>
<li>an ASIC no-action letter does not necessarily preclude third parties (including the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions) from taking legal action in relation to the same conduct or conduct of that kind. Nor does it prevent a court from holding that particular conduct infringes the relevant legislation. ASIC does not represent that the conduct covered by the no-action letter will not be held to contravene the relevant legislation. Nor does ASIC undertake to intervene in an action brought by third parties in respect of such conduct.</li>
<li>a no-action letter is not a guarantee that ASIC will not take action in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC will monitor the effectiveness of the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position during the trial period and reserves the right to modify or withdraw the &lsquo;no-action&rsquo; position at any time.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Roundtable On DeFi And The American Spirit, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the panelists and attendees today for the Commission&rsquo;s fifth roundtable organized by the Crypto Task Force, entitled &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Reflecting on the &ldquo;American Spirit&rdquo; brings to mind the expedition of Merriweather Lewis and William Clark. About 220 years ago on May 14, 1804, Lewis and Clark set out to explore the new Louisiana Territory, purchased the prior year by President Thomas Jefferson.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The size of the United States had doubled overnight, but there were no reliable maps or established routes through the new land. Despite this daunting challenge, Lewis and Clark entered the wilderness to carry out their mission.</p>
<p>While perhaps not nearly as fraught with personal danger, the Commission is similarly navigating through challenging new terrain and plunging into the regulatory wilderness under the leadership of Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force. While the Commission&rsquo;s tools &ndash; such as roundtables, public consultation, and economic analysis &ndash; may be different, I am confident that our expedition can succeed in updating our rulebook to open up new opportunities for American investors and businesses.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s treatment of decentralized finance and other emerging technologies over the past four years was not conducive to regulatory transparency and discouraged entrepreneurs and those developing DeFi from engaging with the Commission. However, that approach has recently changed under the Crypto Task Force, which is charged with coordinating the Commission&rsquo;s effort to find answers to many pressing questions. Thus far, they have changed the SEC&rsquo;s posture on crypto, embraced difficult regulatory questions, and promoted transparency by engaging with the market participants driving innovation and change.</p>
<p>This SEC is committed to high quality regulation. High quality regulation takes time and administrative processes matter. For those who are involved in the development of DeFi, please be patient and work with the Commission and its staff towards achieving the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Although I am uncertain as to what &ldquo;perfect regulation&rdquo; may look like, the path towards it begins with seeking input from the public. This journey towards regulatory clarity will likely be frustrating, and may move in fits and starts. However, by learning from DeFi innovators and advocates, the Commission has a better chance at regulating securities transactions involving DeFi and protecting American investors who utilize decentralized financial services and products.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s participants will provide knowledge and insight about DeFi&rsquo;s development and the existing regulatory barriers preventing growth. Such contributions will help the Commission attempt to strike the proper balance between its role as a regulator and its mandate to foster competition, efficiency, and capital formation.</p>
<p>In DeFi, there is a new landscape of opportunities. People can transact directly with each other without relying on banks or other centralized intermediaries. The Commission should not refrain from engaging in oversight of novel areas simply because it involves thinking outside the existing framework.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The legacy regulatory regime under the federal securities laws presupposes the existence and necessity of numerous intermediaries. I look forward to hearing from today&rsquo;s panelists as to whether such presumptions remain necessary.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>In which types of situations do DeFi systems and smart contracts potentially eliminate the need for a financial intermediary and how?</li>
<li>In what situations should DeFi systems be deemed to fall outside the scope of the securities laws?</li>
<li>What key safeguards are necessary when the securities laws apply to these arrangements?</li>
</ol>
<p>Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s journey took time to complete and carved out an important path to facilitate westward expansion. In so doing, they provided a valuable contribution to American progress. Today&rsquo;s roundtable reflects the SEC&rsquo;s commitment to continued progress and its willingness to consider the role of emerging technologies. As the Commission continues to move through the regulatory wilderness, it should remain true to its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation in its efforts to respond to market innovation.</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to the conversation.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Final Crypto Task Force Roundtable: Where We Go From Here, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. As we begin the final event of this Crypto Task Force series, I think this is a good opportunity to reflect on what has come out of these roundtables and where the Task Force, and the Commission, are going from here.</p>
<p>These roundtables have highlighted that &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; is far from a monolith. We have heard a markedly diverse set of viewpoints, from many different segments of the industry.</p>
<p>We have heard, for example, from many non-SEC registered entities with varying views on whether they or their products should be required to register and be subject to SEC jurisdiction. I expect that this will be a key theme of today&rsquo;s DeFi panel. Back in November 2021, I wrote an article<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-crypto-roundtable-060925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;detailing my views on the opportunities and challenges of DeFi, which I believe require industry and regulatory collaboration to develop compliant solutions. The issues I raised in that article related to market structure, transparency, and retail investor protection, among others, still remain questions today, so I look forward to hearing the panelists&rsquo; views on how we should approach these challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond issues related to registration and jurisdictional lines, other roundtables have focused on current SEC registrants who want to continue operating under SEC oversight, but with altered regulatory requirements tailored to new types of products and technologies.</p>
<p>In addition to these varied and sometimes competing regulatory views, we have heard different opinions on the technologies underlying digital asset products and services. We have heard panelists highlight advantages or disadvantages of particular technologies, and give differing predictions on their capabilities to function effectively as part of a large, complex securities market.</p>
<p>In sum, these roundtables have given us a lot to grapple with, to say the least. While the series was billed as a &ldquo;spring sprint towards crypto clarity,&rdquo; I am unsure whether we&rsquo;ve identified much that can be simply or quickly clarified. When it comes to crypto, it does not appear to me that the SEC is facing problems with ready or easy solutions. What we are facing is heightened expectations of rolling out major changes &mdash;quickly&mdash; to pave the way for crypto expansion into the capital markets.</p>
<p>With issues this complex and stakes this high, it&rsquo;s better to do it right than fast. We need to grapple with the tough questions through the legally sanctioned process of formal rulemaking, as Chairman Atkins alluded to earlier, with full opportunity for notice and comment and public interest findings. I look forward to engaging with my fellow Commissioners, the staff, and the public on what I hope will be a thoughtful and mission-driven rulemaking process for this space. Thank you.</p>

<title>DeFining The American Spirit, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., June 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Chairman Atkins, Commissioner Crenshaw, and Commissioner Uyeda, and thank you all for joining us in-person or online for the final afternoon of the Crypto Task Force&rsquo;s Spring Sprint roundtable series: &ldquo;DeFi and the American Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you especially to our moderator, Troy Paredes, who is returning after his excellent performance at our first roundtable back in March. Troy, we are grateful to have you here again as we wrap up. I also appreciate today&rsquo;s panelists for being part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Over the past four months, the Task Force has held roundtables on security status, trading, tokenization, and custody.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These roundtables have provided invaluable input to the Commission, the Task Force, and the rest of the Commission staff&mdash;input that has informed our views and improved our efforts. The Task Force, which hit the ground running in a sprint of roundtables, intends to keep running the clarity marathon, and the perspectives of roundtable participants will help determine the course.</p>
<p>Our final roundtable is on DeFi, or decentralized finance. You may ask: What business does the SEC have in talking about regulating DeFi? Absolutely none is a reasonable answer, so with that, we will wrap up this roundtable: Thank you everyone for attending! OK, not so fast. Life is not that simple. Even getting to&nbsp;<i>no</i>&nbsp;regulation requires some talking.</p>
<p>What is DeFi? Bitcoin is &ldquo;decentralized finance,&rdquo; but it may not be what first comes to mind when we think of DeFi. Google says DeFi is &ldquo;a blockchain-based financial system that aims to replace traditional financial institutions with peer-to-peer transactions and smart contracts.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;DeFi brings to mind decentralized networks, which enable people to trade tokens and derivatives, engage in lending, or participate in prediction markets. Although sometimes referred to as DeFi &ldquo;platforms,&rdquo; DeFi is not a&nbsp;<i>place</i>&nbsp;people go to access services that someone else provides and controls; it is software code that people use to engage in the activity of transacting without a centralized intermediary. To channel one of today&rsquo;s panelists, I do not go to a decentralized exchange; I make a decentralized exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>DeFi defies our traditional, permissioned world of intermediaries. It enables a person to engage with her peers through a protocol that is open to everybody on the same transparent terms: no need to get consent from any centralized gatekeeper. At its core, DeFi, which blockchain technology enables, is about the freedom to transact with your peers without permission, interference, or intermediation. And that is why DeFi resonates so deeply with the American spirit.</p>
<p>Also resonant with the American spirit is the ability of people to publish written material without permission. Code is protected speech. Because the First Amendment protects someone who writes a DeFi software protocol and publishes it, the SEC has no authority to demand pre-publication approval rights even for code that could be used to exchange securities. The SEC must not infringe on First Amendment rights by regulating someone who merely publishes code on the basis that others use that code to carry out activity that the SEC has traditionally regulated. If somebody else subsequently violates the law using the software protocol, the user&mdash;not the developer of the software&mdash;should face the music.</p>
<p>But sometimes the writer of a protocol used to exchange securities does more than merely publish it. She also might operate, administer, or maintain a platform through which the code can be accessed and that takes custody of client assets or makes execution decisions for clients. In this and other instances, the coder or her platform might be subject to regulation for that conduct. If that conduct relates to securities, the SEC might have a role to play.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Centralized entities that use DeFi protocols that someone else wrote to serve clients do not get a regulatory pass either. Nor can centralized entities avoid regulation by hiding behind a &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; label; that is DINO, or DeFi-In-Name-Only.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;With centralized entities comes the potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, principal-agent problems, information asymmetries, and other issues common in the traditional finance world&mdash;all the issues DeFi is designed to address. The SEC&rsquo;s efforts are best spent protecting investors, not from their own use of open-source software code to engage in transactions with their peers, nor from writers of such code, but from providers of financial services.</p>
<p>I hope that today&rsquo;s discussion will help us ensure that SEC regulation is able to reach activities and entities properly within its ambit regardless of what label they bear, without prohibiting the exercise of individuals&rsquo; rights to publish code and interact with that code. I now will hand it off to Troy. Thank you all for being here, and I look forward to the discussion.</p>

Although the details in the settlement order are limited, the facts at issue there could help spur discussion of which types of activities the SEC should reach. Coburn was the only person with the ability to alter the EtherDelta smart contract, as he was the only person with access to the private key for the administrator account, which could be used to change the permissible fees for transacting using EtherDelta or the address of the account to which those fees were directed. The order book sat on a centralized server that was maintained by EtherDelta, rather than on the Ethereum Blockchain. https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/admin/2018/34-84553.pdf</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood today released a letter in response to correspondence from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors requesting the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) rescind its preemption regulations.</p>
<p>In the letter, Acting Comptroller Hood reaffirmed the OCC&rsquo;s support and defense of preemption as a cornerstone of the dual banking system that is fundamental to the operation of the federal banking system. The OCC&rsquo;s preemption regulations are consistent with federal law, Supreme Court precedent, and a powerful enabler of local and national prosperity and growth.</p>

<title>US Financial Groups Urge Administration To Address Pattern Of Data Security Lapses At Regulators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, MFA and SIFMA called for significant reforms to how federal financial regulators handle sensitive data following the latest in a series of data breaches that exposed over 148,000 private correspondences containing sensitive supervisory information about U.S. financial institutions. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/data-security-joint-trades/">letter</a>&nbsp;addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the organizations identified concerns with regulators&rsquo; data management practices spanning the previous administration. Weaknesses were identified in February 2025; however, growing threats from hostile nation-states targeting U.S. critical infrastructure serve as a reminder of the urgency to address vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[G]overnment agencies are increasingly the target of persistent and sophisticated nation-state attacks that could disrupt financial markets and our economy,&rdquo; the organizations wrote. &ldquo;It is imperative that federal regulators recognize that they are equally a target of malicious actors and implement the same or substantially similar cybersecurity and incident response practices that they expect financial institutions to maintain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Financial institutions are legally required to share sensitive, proprietary and non-public information with their regulators as part of the supervisory process. This information can range from capital and liquidity management to cybersecurity protocols. However, centralizing large amounts of data can create a prime target for illicit actors seeking to harm U.S. economic security. Government agencies, including regulatory agencies, are increasingly the target of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, both the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency &mdash; the Treasury bureau responsible for supervising the U.S. banking system &mdash; have suffered significant cyber incidents. The latest dates back to 2023 and was identified in early 2025. Here are the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackers compromised the OCC&rsquo;s systems in May 2023.</li>
<li>The OCC did not learn of the suspicious activity until February 2025 &mdash; meaning, hackers likely had access to the OCC&rsquo;s systems for over a year and a half.</li>
<li>The breach exposed an estimated 148,000 emails, some of which may have contained highly sensitive supervisory information that could give hostile nation states ample information to harm America&rsquo;s financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These weaknesses point to a pattern of problems in how U.S. agencies secure data and are held accountable. To mitigate risk and prevent similar problems in the future, the groups made four recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold agencies to the same security and data protection standards as private companies.</li>
<li>Avoid centralizing sensitive data that could affect entire economic sectors and instead allow companies to maintain control and access to their data.</li>
<li>Require regulatory agencies to notify affected companies when things go wrong.</li>
<li>Limit data collection to only what is necessary.</li>
</ol>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you and good afternoon.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is a great pleasure to be with you today. Let me begin by thanking Commissioner Peirce and the Crypto Task Force for their organizing today&rsquo;s event, and Commissioner Crenshaw and Commissioner Uyeda for their participation.&nbsp; Of course, I very much thank the roundtable panelists and our moderator, Troy Parades, for their voluntary contribution of time and talent to our endeavor.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s roundtable is titled &ldquo;DeFi and&nbsp;<i>the American Spirit</i>.&rdquo; This is an apt title because the American values of economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation are in the DNA of the DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, movement.</p>
<p>Blockchains, of course, are a very creative and potentially revolutionary innovation that have us rethinking evidence of ownership and transfer of intellectual and economic property rights.&nbsp; They are shared databases that enable ownership of a type of digital property called crypto assets without reliance on an intermediary or central party. Instead, these peer-to-peer networks incorporate an economic mechanism to encourage participants to validate and maintain the database in accordance with the network&rsquo;s rules. These are free market systems where users pay demand-based fees to network participants to have their transactions included within a so-called &ldquo;block&rdquo; of data with finite storage capacity.</p>
<p>The prior U.S. government administration discouraged Americans from participating in these market-based systems by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions. I am grateful to the Division of Corporation Finance staff for clarifying its view that voluntary participation in a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake network as a &ldquo;miner,&rdquo; &ldquo;validator,&rdquo; or &ldquo;staking-as-a-service&rdquo; provider is not within the scope of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; As happy as I am over that step, it is not a duly promulgated rule with the force of law, so we cannot stop there.&nbsp; The Securities and Exchange Commission must adopt a regulation based on the authority that Congress has given us.</p>
<p>Another core feature of blockchain technology is the ability for individuals to have self-custody of crypto assets in a personal digital wallet. The right to have self-custody of one&rsquo;s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet. I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially where intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.</p>
<p>The prior President&rsquo;s administration undermined innovation in self-custodial digital wallets and other on-chain technologies by asserting through regulatory actions that the developers of such software may be conducting brokerage activity. Engineers should not be subject to the federal securities laws solely for publishing this type of software code. As one court put it, it would be irrational to hold the developer of a self-driving car liable &ndash; here, quoting from the court&rsquo;s decision &ndash; &ldquo;for a third-party&rsquo;s use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank. In those circumstances, one would not sue the car company for facilitating the wrongdoing; they would sue the individual who committed the wrong.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are developing software applications that are designed to function without administration by any operator. The idea of self-executing software code that is accessible to everyone, but controlled by no one, and that enables private, peer-to-peer transactions may sound like science fiction. But, blockchain technology makes possible an entirely new class of software that can perform these functions without an intermediary. I do not believe that we should allow century-old regulatory frameworks to stifle innovation with technologies that could upend and most importantly improve and advance our current, traditional intermediated model.&nbsp; We should not automatically fear the future.</p>
<p>These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises. While centralized platforms waivered and failed under recent stresses, many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Most current securities rules and regulations are premised upon the regulation of issuers and intermediaries, such as broker-dealers, advisers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries. I have asked the Commission staff to explore whether further guidance or rulemaking may be helpful for enabling registrants to transact with these software systems in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>I also am excited about the use of on-chain software systems by issuers and intermediaries to eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity. Current securities regulations already contemplate the use of new technologies by issuers and intermediaries, but I have asked the staff to consider whether amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules and regulations would be better suited to provide needed accommodation for issuers and intermediaries who seek to administer on-chain financial systems.</p>
<p>While the Commission and its staff work to propose fit-for-purpose rules of the road for on-chain financial markets, I have directed the staff to consider a conditional exemptive relief framework or &ldquo;innovation exemption&rdquo; that would expeditiously allow registrants and non-registrants to bring on-chain products and services to market. An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump&rsquo;s vision to make America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the planet&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-defi-roundtable-060925#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with to certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the discussions to follow.</p>
