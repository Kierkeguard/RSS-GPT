<title>ASX Welcomes ASIC’s Capital Markets Roadmap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX welcomes the release of ASIC&rsquo;s capital markets roadmap, which outlines a forward-looking agenda to strengthen Australia&rsquo;s capital markets and ensure Australia continues to be an efficient, attractive and globally competitive market to invest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s public markets play a foundational role in capital formation, price discovery and wealth creation. ASX supports ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining robust and transparent markets. ASIC&rsquo;s roadmap recognises that there is a need to continually evolve regulatory settings to meet the changing needs of issuers and investors.</p>
<p><b>Darren Yip, Group Executive, Markets and Listings, ASX, said: </b></p>
<p>&ldquo;ASIC&rsquo;s roadmap is a timely and important step in ensuring Australia&rsquo;s public markets remain globally competitive. We welcome ASIC&rsquo;s focus on practical reforms that will support innovation, improve access to capital, and ensure our markets continue to deliver for companies and investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s encouraging to see ASIC take forward a number of ideas raised in ASX&rsquo;s submission, to ensure Australia remains a globally competitive place to list, including streamlining IPO processes, reviewing listing requirements, and exploring new frameworks to support market integrity and growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also remain supportive of competition that contributes to strong and effective capital markets in Australia. We have a strong value proposition for corporate listings and our listings business competes with many other local, regional and global exchanges and continues to offer one of the world&rsquo;s leading listings venues with over 2,000 listed entities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br clear="ALL" /> ASIC has stated that it is open to reconsider the potential of dual class shares where careful consideration of the merits and risks are undertaken and appropriate safeguards are proposed. ASIC has also stated that it sees merit in non-discretionary trading plans for company insiders and will continue to engage on the idea. ASX supports further discussion on these topics, consistent with global developments.</p>
<p>ASX also welcomes ASIC&rsquo;s recognition of the importance of simplifying corporate governance frameworks. Last month, ASX announced that it would take responsibility for future editions of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and</p>
<p>Recommendations, supported by a newly established independent advisory group. This forms part of a broader program of work underway at ASX, including recent consultation on proposed changes to the Listing Rules relating to shareholder approvals and dual-listed entities.</p>

<title>ASIC: A Roadmap For Capital Markets To Grow Our Economy</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-a-roadmap-for-capital-markets-to-grow-our-economy-2025114/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-a-roadmap-for-capital-markets-to-grow-our-economy-2025114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released its roadmap to promote strong, efficient, and globally competitive capital markets in Australia.</p>
<p>The report,&nbsp;<em>Advancing Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: Discussion paper response&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-823-advancing-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-discussion-paper-response-report/" title="REP 823 Advancing Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: Discussion paper response report">REP 823</a>), outlines a roadmap to unlock opportunities and tackle emerging risks in Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets by embracing new capital flows and technologies, keeping pace with evolving investor needs, and making it easier for business and growth capital.</p>
<p>The roadmap draws on critical findings from ASIC&rsquo;s new surveillance into the private credit sector (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-820-private-credit-surveillance-report-retail-and-wholesale-surveillance/" title="REP 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance">REP 820</a>). The report builds on the private credit expert insights released in September (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-814-private-credit-in-australia/" title="REP 814 Private credit in Australia">REP 814</a>), along with industry and expert insight from submissions received from around 100 sources in response to ASIC&rsquo;s discussion paper.</p>
<p>The roadmap also draws on expert insights from Dr Carole Comerton-Forde on the forces shaping the future of Australia&rsquo;s capital markets (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-822-australia-s-capital-markets-forces-shaping-the-next-decade/" title="REP 822 Australia&rsquo;s capital markets: Forces shaping the next decade">REP 822</a>) and from EY Parthenon on international approaches to private markets reporting (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-821-private-capital-market-reporting-global-practices-and-lessons/" title="REP 821 Private capital market reporting: Global practices and lessons">REP 821</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said most developed countries were grappling with the same changes and that there were significant opportunities for Australia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This roadmap lays out the choices and future of Australia&rsquo;s markets. We want our markets &ndash; private and public &ndash; to grow. That growth means stronger businesses, more jobs and a boost to our economy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strong markets have strong market integrity. We want to lay the foundations for managed investment schemes and private markets to sustainably thrive for the future benefit of business and investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We see enormous opportunity for public and private markets to thrive and grow together especially as they embrace new technology and innovation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the heart of this roadmap is a clear message, that Australia and ASIC want to be backers, not blockers of investment and capital.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This roadmap is the launchpad for action, not the finish line. Australia should be bold and seize the opportunities ahead, so that our markets remain strong, dynamic and globally competitive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC strongly backs the modernisation of public markets to fuel growth and encourage participation, including support for new listing frameworks and robust trading platforms. The report details ASIC&rsquo;s work to streamline IPOs and disclosure requirements, and the need for market operators and government to closely consider director responsibilities, free float requirements and facilitating more foreign listings.</p>
<p>In private markets, the report outlines that ASIC needs better tools from government for effective supervision of funds, including notification of wholesale funds in operation, data collection, and independent audited financial reports for wholesale funds.</p>
<p>The report also underscores the role private credit is playing in Australia&rsquo;s financial system and sets out clear principles, grounded in the law, for private markets to lift practices to promote confident and informed participation by investors and borrowers.</p>
<p>In addition, for private credit, ASIC will:</p>
<ul>
<li>issue a catalogue that summarises fund managers&rsquo; legal obligations and related ASIC regulatory guidance</li>
<li>refresh funds management regulatory guidance on a targeted basis</li>
<li>engage with industry bodies as they work to enhance industry standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said the agency&rsquo;s work had reinforced the significance of superannuation as a market shaping force in Australia and importance of the supervision of superannuation trustees and platforms through its market cleanliness, financial reporting and audit, and investment disclosure activity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our superannuation trustees are as systemically important as institutions like banks including in their role as stewards of other people&rsquo;s money and market integrity,&rsquo; Commissioner Constant said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As they expand and look for new areas to grow, we expect them to take on even greater importance in public investments and private credit, which in turn facilitates access for retail investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our roadmap sets out a future where private credit grows from strong foundations to give access to opportunity for investors and to capital for business and growth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Acting now to address poorer practices will help avoid future disruption. It is clear increased oversight of private markets is essential, and ASIC will continue its surveillance and enforcement work in private credit to ensure compliance with the law. If we do not see material improvements, we are prepared to pursue stronger regulatory action.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s clear message is we want both options for Australia - settings that promote healthy, vibrant public and private markets - we want to hear your ideas, and we are watching to ensure opportunity and risk are appropriately balanced.&rsquo;</p>

<p>ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/dp-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-a-discussion-paper-on-the-dynamics-between-public-and-private-markets/" title="DP Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: A discussion paper on the dynamics between public and private markets">discussion paper on the evolving dynamics between public and private markets</a>&nbsp;explored the shifting dynamics between public and private markets, and the feedback was clear: both markets are essential to a strong, efficient, and globally competitive economy.</p>
<p>To support healthy and attractive public markets, the agency announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/" title="25-096MR ASIC clears path for faster IPOs">changes to the IPO process</a>&nbsp;in June, and recently made a number of moves to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-154mr-enhancing-competition-and-innovation-in-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets/" title="25-154MR Enhancing competition and innovation in Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets">foster competition and create more opportunities for companies and investors</a>, and to attract more foreign capital to Australia.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report addresses the fundamental questions the agency posed in its discussion paper at the start of the year about the future state of our markets, the risks and opportunities for productivity within them and the part that ASIC will continue to play.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Minutes Of The CBDC Engagement Forum - May 2025</title>

<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome and competition law reminder&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The meeting opened with a welcome from the Bank. A reminder of competition law obligations was read. There were no objections to the minutes of the previous meeting held in February 2025.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Offline payments&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Danny Russell (Bank of England) presented findings from the Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/digital-pound-experiment-report-offline-payments">offline payments experiments report</a>, which form part of the digital pound design phase. These experiments focused on peer-to-peer payments, but the Bank has looked at offline point-of-sale (POS) functionality in previous work. The aim was to assess the technical feasibility implementing an offline payment functionality for a digital pound.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Discussion:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Members asked whether there is research on the proportion of the population that would benefit from offline payments. The Bank expects that further work will be needed in this area, particularly to understand inclusion implications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members highlighted the limitations of current POS systems, and the Bank confirmed its previous POS experiments showed these systems are not equipped to handle offline payments, which would likely require new software development.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members discussed the relationship between offline POS and future open banking account-to-account (A2A) payments, with a focus on ensuring consistency with broader payment strategies.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It was noted that transit systems such as TfL already support offline payments, specifically offline authentication with deferred settlement, and that liability sharing is a key component of such systems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Privacy Working Group&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Ruth Wandh&ouml;fer (Engagement Forum member) presented on privacy, summarising feedback from the consultation. Privacy was one of the most frequently raised issues among the 50,000 responses received. She outlined three models of data access: minimum data access, a GDPR-style model, and enhanced privacy protection. The presentation also covered the role of wallet providers, cybersecurity, data minimisation, and transparency. A dashboard-style approach to managing data permissions was suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Discussion:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Members noted that public understanding of privacy in the context of the digital pound may be inconsistent or incomplete. Ruth emphasised the need to educate the public on how data is currently used and how it would be used in a digital pound system.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There was discussion about whether enhanced standards of privacy could be a differentiator for a digital pound and whether smart data principles could be embedded from the outset. Members also raised the importance of distinguishing between innovation and socially useful innovation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Considerations were raised about trust in government versus private sector actors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4: Intermediary roles and scheme rulebook&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Bank presented on the roles of intermediaries in the digital pound platform model. Payment Interface Providers (PIPs) would provide core services, while Enhanced Service Interface Providers (ESIPs) could offer value-added services. The presentation covered considerations around commercial viability, conduct of business and consumer protection implications, directory services, inclusion, and the potential scheme rulebook. Existing rulebooks such as those used by the ECB and CHAPS are potential analogues.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Discussion:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Members asked whether PIPs would be agents of the Bank and who would bear liability in the event of a cyber incident.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There was interest in how performance metrics (e.g. fail rates and speed) would be defined and whether smart data principles would be integrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members discussed who would pay for fraud and infrastructure upkeep, and how counterparty discoverability would work. These remain areas for further exploration.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some members questioned whether ESIPs should be more tightly regulated, particularly in relation to consumer risk and access for low-income users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members asked whether the Bank would offer a general-purpose wallet. The Bank clarified that were a digital pound to be launched, it does not expect to offer a public wallet and emphasised the importance of avoiding user lock-in to specific wallet providers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://paragonpr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2YwKczYy-9UsgCNqMfbp1TV0GPN00jBRIz7baj-UBp3SRfw1PmgFefbAFkbXFbgct8LC7JgDIJvM7-y5zajqrswhNNIvSSKm27zAHCRmvJAIgptSMdeE7-_Yr6U1ND6W9UTbsZwvaVU1vI_5wHCha5fg2AXnT5MWeYp__FV_rLVHTHQ" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rimes</a>, a leading provider of enterprise data management and investment intelligence solutions to the global investment community, today announced two senior appointments as part of its continued investment in talent and global growth. Ross Allen joins as Head of APAC, while&nbsp; Bill Blythe joins as Global Head of EDM Sales.</p>
<p>These strategic additions to the Rimes team reinforce the company&rsquo;s commitment to expanding its presence in APAC and driving sustained momentum worldwide, with both leaders bringing extensive expertise in capital markets data solutions, enterprise data management and experience managing complex client relationships across global financial institutions.</p>
<p><b><i>Ross Allen joins as Head of APAC</i><br /></b></p>
<p>Ross Allen brings more than 25 years of global financial services and enterprise data experience to Rimes.&nbsp; Working in London, Singapore and Australia he held various senior leadership roles at IHS Markit (now S&amp;P Global) including Head of Financial Markets APAC.&nbsp; Most recently Ross served as Chief Commercial Officer at Vyzrd, an AI-enabled climate-risk analytics firm. Based in Australia, Ross will lead Rimes&rsquo; growth strategy and client engagement across APAC, strengthening the company&rsquo;s regional presence and partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The investment Rimes is making in the APAC region reflects the company&rsquo;s commitment to our clients and the growing demand for intelligent, enterprise-grade data solutions,&rdquo; commented Allen. &ldquo;I look forward to working with our clients, partners and team to drive innovation in capital markets, and build on the momentum in APAC.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b><i>Bill Blythe joins Rimes as Global Head of EDM Sales</i></b></p>
<p>Bill Blythe joins Rimes as Global Head of Enterprise Data Management (EDM) Sales, bringing more than 25 years of leadership experience in financial technology and data management. Most recently, he served as Global Head of Sales, Enterprise Data Management at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, where he led teams across North America, EMEA, and APAC. Before joining S&amp;P Global, Bill was Global Business Development Director at Gresham Technologies and previously held senior roles at SmartStream Technologies, Mercator, and Finastra, building a track record of commercial excellence and strategic growth.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s decision to join Rimes reflects the macroeconomic trends transforming the data landscape, including growing market complexity and the rising demand for stronger integration and governance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today released several updates to ensure consistency with the latest regulatory and reporting framework developments. These include an updated&nbsp;Mapping&nbsp;Tool reflecting recent amendments to the Pillar 3 disclosure and supervisory reporting frameworks, as well as a new version of the&nbsp;Signposting&nbsp;Tool incorporating the revised requirements up to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-40"><span>Reporting framework v4.0.</span></a><span>&nbsp;Additionally, the EBA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/reporting-time-traveller"><span>reporting Time Traveller</span></a><span>&nbsp;platform has been enhanced to align with the most recent changes in regulatory reporting.</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-11/12ad8934-c91b-4cbc-b270-e55136d21e1f/2025%2011%2003%20%28Mapping_tool%29%20clean%20version.xlsx" title="2025 11 03 (Mapping_tool) clean version"><span>Mapping Tool</span></a>, which specifies the mapping between quantitative disclosure data points and the relevant supervisory reporting data points, aims at facilitating institutions&rsquo; compliance with disclosure requirements and improving the consistency and quality of the information disclosed. The updates mainly reflect the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) changes as well as the comments received by the industry.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.eba.europa.eu/Signposting%20tool/EBA%20Signspoting%20Tool%20-%20Updated-Revised_4.0.xlsm"><span>Signposting Tool</span></a>, which helps institutions understand the reporting requirements and templates that are applicable to them based on their size and complexity, has been updated in line with the changes to the CRR3 and to the technical standards on supervisory reporting. The updates had already been identified in the EBA Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2021/1013948/Study%20of%20the%20cost%20of%20compliance%20with%20supervisory%20reporting%20requirement.pdf">Study of the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements</a>&nbsp;as one of the measures to help institutions identify and understand the applicable supervisory reporting requirements, so as to promote efficiency in the reporting process. This will, in turn, reduce overall compliance and reporting costs.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Time Traveller</span>&nbsp;tool serves as a central resource for retrieving the templates and instructions applicable at a certain reference date related to regulatory modules that institutions are required to report. The tool is undergoing a significant update, mainly driven by the latest changes to the related reporting technical standards across most modules.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background and next steps</h4>
<p>The signposting tool comes in response to one of the recommendations in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/supervisory-reporting/cost-compliance-supervisory-reporting">EBA report Study of the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements</a>&nbsp;(recommendation 2).</p>
<p>A similar&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-09/24327300-de16-4c1f-a018-8e5d5ccf8307/Signposting%20tool.xlsx">signposting tool for disclosures</a>&nbsp;is also available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/transparency-and-pillar-3">EBA website</a>, that covers the Pillar 3 requirements of the institutions.</p>
<p>The Time Traveller tool will be continuously updated in line with the release of new regulatory frameworks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX), in alignment with the German Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt) at the Federal Environment Agency (UBA), has published the 2026 schedule for the post-purchases of German national emissions trading system certificates (nEZ / nEHS) with the year identifier 2025.</p>
<p class="titelblack">The sale of nEHS allowances with the year identifier 2025 will take place each Tuesday between January and August 2026. In September, sales will take place on two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays. The first sale for the 2025 annual identifier will be held on 13 January 2026, last one on 17 September 2026. The time window for nEHS sales will be open to participating companies on the respective days from 09:00 to 15:00 CET/CEST.</p>
<p class="titelblack">On sales dates, companies subject to the German national emissions trading system can purchase nEHS certificates with the 2025 annual identifier at a fixed price of 55 euros/nEHS.</p>
<p class="titelblack">The possibility of post-purchases is limited by law to 10 per cent of the quantity already purchased by the respective participant in 2025 (Section 10 (2) sentence 3 in conjunction with (1) sentence 1 of the Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG)). The decisive factor for calculating post-purchase limit is the quantity of nEHS certificates with the annual identifier 2025 held in the respective compliance account of a obligated company as of 31 December 2025.</p>
<p class="titelblack">In addition, EEX will carry out the sale and auctioning of nEHS certificates maturing from 2026 onwards on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany.

<p>U.S. farmer sentiment edged slightly higher in October, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4548503-1&amp;h=3412060244&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;rising 3 points to a reading of 129. The increase was fueled primarily by a rise in the Index of Current Conditions, which climbed 8 points to 130, while the Index of Future Expectations was virtually unchanged at 129, just 1 point higher than in September. Farmers' appraisals of current conditions highlight a "tale of two economies": Livestock producers remain highly optimistic about their farm conditions, partly supported by record-high profitability in the beef sector, while crop producers report a more pessimistic view of the current situation on their farms due to low profit margins across major crop enterprises. The barometer survey took place&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Oct. 13-17</span>.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped to 78 in October, 10 points lower than in September, reflecting a sharp decline in farmers' financial performance expectations over the past few months. In May, the index stood at 109, 31 points above the October reading, before steadily falling through the spring and summer. Similar to the Index of Current Conditions, there continues to be a disparity between crop and livestock producers: Crop farmers expect their financial performance to fall well below that of a year ago, while livestock producers anticipate results similar to the previous year. Despite the overall decline in financial expectations, the Farm Capital Investment Index increased by 9 points to 62, boosted once again by optimism among livestock producers.</p>
<p>In previous barometer surveys, most producers said they expect the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide compensation for weak commodity prices, similar to the 2019 Market Facilitation Program. This month, respondents were asked how they would use a potential supplementary payment from the USDA on their farms. More than half (53%) said they would use it to pay down debt, while one-fourth (25%) said they would strengthen their farm's working capital. Fewer producers said they would invest in farm machinery (12%) or cover family living expenses (11%).</p>
<p>The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index rose 7 points in October to 113, following four months of declines. The shift in sentiment reflects more producers anticipating farmland values to increase rather than hold steady, reversing September's trend. This month, 30% of respondents said they expect farmland values to rise over the next year, up from 24% in September. The percentage expecting values to fall remained essentially unchanged at 17%, compared to 18% the previous month.</p>
<p>"U.S. farmers are adjusting to ongoing economic pressures in different ways," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4548503-1&amp;h=1075879571&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4548503-1&amp;h=1598237906&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "Livestock producers are seeing strong returns and remain optimistic, while many crop producers are contemplating management changes for 2026 to help cope with tighter margins."</p>
<p>To learn more about how crop producers will respond to weak operating margins, the October survey asked respondents who planted corn in 2025 about any crop production management changes they plan to make in 2026 in response to low corn prices. Nearly one-third (30%) said they do not plan to make any changes, while 29% said they plan to reduce phosphorus applications. Twenty-seven percent said they intend to adopt lower-cost seed traits or varieties, 16% plan to reduce nitrogen applications, while just 11% said they would lower corn seeding rates in 2026.</p>
<p>Policy uncertainty continues to influence farmer sentiment. In October, 58% of producers said they expect increased use of tariffs by the U.S. to strengthen the agricultural economy, up from September but still below the 70% reported in April and May. Meanwhile, 16% of respondents said they were uncertain about the impact of tariff policies on the agricultural economy, double that of both April and May. Despite this uncertainty, roughly 70% of producers said they believe the U.S. is headed in the "right direction."</p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>Fair4All Finance Delivering Financial Inclusion Together Conference<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>4 November 2025</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion and capability must go hand in hand. People need knowledge, confidence and support to make informed decisions.</li>
<li>There is a gap between access to financial services and the public&rsquo;s ability to use them effectively.</li>
<li>The FCA cannot solve these issues by itself &ndash; coordinated action and collaboration is essential to ensure support reaches those who need it most.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-introduction" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a pivotal moment for financial inclusion and capability.</p>
<p>When they are mismatched, it creates points of vulnerability when small decisions carry big consequences.</p>
<p>Ones you can see in the realities people face every day: in the choices they make, the help they look for, and the support they can or cannot find.</p>
<p>Listening to a call with Citizens Advice in Caerphilly, I heard from someone with multiple debts, caring responsibilities and health issues.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the complexity of the system, she felt unable to act. She had no clear, trusted way of understanding how to get out of debt.</p>
<p>Similarly in Bournemouth, I met a volunteer for Christians Against Poverty who was once a client. They explained the lack of confidence to even pick up the phone and speak with creditors in the midst of personal crises and anxiety.</p>
<p>I heard from Age UK in Truro about the issues in rural communities, with many not knowing how they can pay for basics without cash. Formally &lsquo;included&rsquo; but effectively excluded in practice.</p>
<p>These stories are more common than most realise &ndash; and reflect a structural issue.</p>
<p>We, like Fair4All Finance, have been involved in the development of the new Financial Inclusion strategy which will be published shortly.</p>
<p>The UK has made solid progress.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, basic banking was out of reach for many. Today, more people have accounts than ever before, digital banking has opened access, and cash availability has been protected.</p>
<p>We are working, alongside F4AF, to increase the supply of affordable credit through partnerships and innovation. You have helped expand access and deployed dormant asset funding on inclusion.</p>
<p>On insurance too, working to improve take up among often excluded groups.</p>
<p>These steps matter because inclusion is about more than simply opening the door to new products. &nbsp;It is not a once-and-done exercise. It&rsquo;s about expanding availability of choices at predictable points in life when financial decisions are made.</p>
<p>More people, making confident, informed decisions, and choosing the right tool to help.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-capability-gap" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The capability gap</h2>
<p>Increased access alone doesn&rsquo;t guarantee successful outcomes for individuals &ndash; or the wider system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those depend on financial capability: the knowledge, confidence and support to make good choices or avoid bad ones.</p>
<p>And this is where a particular problem lies. Over the past decade access to new products has exploded and yet, while we have seen some improvement in capability, the rate has not been anywhere near the same.</p>
<p>That imbalance carries consequences. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As of May 2024, 67% of renters did not hold contents insurance. That can decide whether a theft or leak is a minor inconvenience or a serious financial setback. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One in 10 adults are not confident in their ability to identify a potential scam, rising to 16% for adults with a household income of less than &pound;15,000 and 17% for those over 75. Households which may not be able to stand the shock of losing money to scams.</p>
<p>Research shows that fewer than 15% of consumers consistently pay down their highest interest balance first.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t necessarily failures of personal responsibility or intelligence. They&rsquo;re the result of people reaching key financial decisions without the support, confidence or tools to act well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But why has financial capability lagged behind increased access? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rapid digitisation has played a major role, placing complex products at people&rsquo;s fingertips. Crypto, Contracts for Difference (CFDs), FX: all traded through apps. &nbsp;A global phenomenon. The OECD is looking at whether financial capability strategies are keeping pace.</p>
<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s fragmentation. A lot of activity across government departments in different nations, the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS), banks, insurers, schools and charities, but with scope for greater coordination.</p>
<p>Good initiatives not always reaching the people who need them most. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, capability is still too often treated as an add-on under community engagement rather than a key part of how firms design products and services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We know some firms do this well but for others it feels like more of a gesture &ndash; and where understanding isn&rsquo;t built in, and communications aren&rsquo;t built for customers, then confusion thrives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, responsibility and risk for financial decisions is increasingly shifting to individuals. Auto-enrolment, credit offers, tenancy decisions &ndash; &nbsp;all personal choices with real consequences. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the right support mechanisms haven&rsquo;t kept up. More access to information than ever before, yes. But is it the right type of information, at the right time? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the benefits of capability are hard to measure effectively. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because their impact shows up in avoided harm rather than headline growth, the debate over investment risks being distorted.</p>
<p>But evidence we do have points in the same direction &ndash; better understanding reduces arrears, complaints and scam losses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need a single multiplier to know that less of this, and better coverage, will strengthen firms and the system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These dynamics reinforce one another. Fragmentation makes delivery uneven. Add-on treatment makes capability a nice-to-have, rather than essential. The measurement debate delays action.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-so-what-do-we-do-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>So what do we do?</h2>
<p>We now need to connect financial inclusion and capability. Improved inclusion should be the goal, but capability needs to be enhanced at the same time and potentially more quickly.</p>
<p>The Treasury Select Committee underlined this point in their recent work on ISAs, warning against pushing people into riskier investments without the understanding to manage them. They called for a focus on stronger capability and access to advice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we expand access with capability baked in, we build individual resilience and security.</p>
<p>We need to build skills that let people navigate products that may not even yet exist &ndash; in an AI-driven and automated future &nbsp;&ndash; while reaching those excluded from the system and encouraging those who opt out to re-engage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the responsibility of one institution like the FCA. Neither financial inclusion nor improving capability are within our exclusive remit. But we are uniquely placed to help fill some of the gaps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We can remove barriers &ndash; either perceived or actual &ndash; that stand in the way of firms wanting to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Our innovation services have helped firms providing non-traditional affordability and credit scoring tools.</p>
<p>Our research like Financial Lives shines a light on where problems exist and our behavioural economic research helps develop solutions.</p>
<p>We are also rebalancing risk in the system &ndash; not just to encourage growth but because there is benefit to consumers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we have heard that with more risk come fewer consumer protections, more chances for things to go wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we intervene more with ever more granular restrictions, we may in fact limit the type of innovation required to bring people into financial services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been upfront that some of our revolutionary targeted support changes may result in a worse outcome for some. But not acting leaves millions facing the risk of no support when making key financial decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On mortgages too, lenders have told us that they can now lend around &pound;30,000 more, following clarification of our mortgage stress test rule. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We judged this a risk worth taking, allowing more people the security that comes with home ownership.</p>
<p>People need to be able to make informed choices about the services they are buying, not just be prevented from making any choice at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we will help bring together those with an interest in these issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To focus on capability-by-design at key moments, plain-language explainers, and shared evaluation so successful models can scale. We will say more about this next year.</p>
<p>We will also build an evidence base &ndash; reviewing existing research and commissioning new work to help fill gaps. We will make findings public, so others can align their work.</p>
<p>We will continue to warn about scams. Our innovation services will continue to support firms developing products that drive inclusion. We will explore whether our colleagues can use their volunteering days to support financial education, helping to make a real difference on the ground.</p>
<p>We will play our part, but we are not the only ones on the pitch.</p>
<h3>To Government: coordinate and lead. &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Once the Government has published its Financial Inclusion Strategy, the next step will be to implement it &ndash; turning ambition into clear outcomes.</p>
<p>We would urge the Government to deepen and embed the work in schools, working with others. &nbsp;We are committed to supporting workplace savings and will continue to collaborate with Government and others to promote the successful roll-out of these schemes.</p>
<p>MaPS can act as the coordination hub: reducing duplication, setting shared standards, and aligning delivery around predictable life moments.</p>
<p>On funding, we also welcome the new focus of dormant assets on financial capability initiatives that could reach the most financially vulnerable. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>To industry: build on what already works. &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Banks fund financial education in schools &ndash; around &pound;7m each year. Many run initiatives to help excluded people open bank accounts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The task now is to expand that good work, so it is consistently ready and available for individuals. That means embedding support into product design, not tacking it on at the end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Employers have a unique role at the start of and during working life. But we must also reach those outside traditional employment &ndash; including self-employed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And do more to test and publish what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have made much progress on financial inclusion. But widening access without raising capability leaves people with more choices they don&rsquo;t feel ready to make.</p>
<p>If we lift capability to match inclusion, buffers rise; cover improves; more people save and invest with confidence; scams fall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And decisions are taken at the right time, for the right reasons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust in the system grows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Government can coordinate, legislate where needed, and sustain this momentum.</p>
<p>MaPS can lead on capability and alignment. Industry can build capability into journeys, not bolt it on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And the FCA will play our part by convening, building and sharing evidence, providing clarity, and promoting innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Inclusion gives people the tools, and the choice. Capability helps them to use those tools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting both right strengthens households and stabilises the system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The direction is set. The momentum is building. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take advantage of it to finish the job and transform financial capability.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>SET has joined forces with BOI to drive the New Economy and organized a special seminar on "BOI to IPO: Capital Market to Drive Growth" on November 4, 2025.</li>
<li>This event marks the launch of a collaboration between the two entities to promote investment in high-growth businesses, laying the foundation for the country's economic shift from traditional manufacturing and services to Thailand 4.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and The Thailand Board of Investment (BOI), with commitment to being a key mechanism to drive the Thai economy into a new digital era, has organized a seminar entitled "BOI to IPO: Capital Market to Drive Growth" to encourage and promote companies in the New Economy industries, driven by technology and innovation, with the growth potential to be listed in the Thai capital market. The seminar was held on Tuesday November 4, 2025, at the SET building.</p>
<p><b>BOI Secretary General Narit Therdsteerasukdi </b>stated that the collaboration between BOI and SET will be multiple efforts that can uplevel both Thai and foreign entrepreneurs to grow and compete in the digital world through the integration of benefits, privileges and tools from both organizations. At the initial stage, the collaboration will focus on two key areas. The first area is to attract leading international companies, particularly in three key high-tech industries namely smart electronics &amp; appliances, electric vehicles, and digital-related industries, which have established operations in Thailand and have already received investment promotion from BOI, to list on SET to boost their fundraising potential, enhance corporate governance standards, strengthen the Thai capital market, while providing Thai investors with opportunities to be shareholders of industries of the future. The second area is to encourage the current listed companies to further invest in specific areas to enhance production efficiency, leading to sustainable growth via BOI's Smart and Sustainable Industry measures and SET's JUMP+ program. These endeavors are in line with BOI's goal to gear up Thailand for the new economy driven by technology, innovation, and sustainability.</p>
<p><b>SET President Asadej Kongsiri</b> stated that one of SET&rsquo;s missions is to serve as the center to connect businesses with access to fundraising sources, while creating a diverse range of quality products as alternatives for investors. SET has recently revised the listing criteria on SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) to facilitate high-growth New Economy businesses to be listed, utilizing adjusted market capitalization criteria, such as encouraging businesses related to technology and innovation that are profitable or likely to be profitable to apply for listing, among others. In addition, SET is currently in the process of reviewing the rules, regulations and criteria to ensure they are advanced and comparable to the stock exchanges in the region.</p>
<p>The "BOI to IPO: Capital Market to Drive Growth" seminar marks the beginning of a collaboration between the two entities to communicate to entrepreneurs in the target industries. It has provided information and guidelines on how to support the business sector in helping drive the new economy altogether. BOI Secretary General Narit Therdsteerasukdi has given a talk on the topic of "BOI Promotes Investment to Restructure the Thai Economy into the New Economy&rdquo;. In addition, Amnouy Jiramahapoka, SET&rsquo;s Executive Vice President - Issuer &amp;&nbsp;Listing Division, has provided information on "Fundraising Opportunities for Businesses to Enhance Competitiveness". Moreover, there has been a panel discussion on "Upleveling Growth via Capital Market Mechanism" participated by executives from the public and private sectors: Chantanida Sarigaphuti, The Siam Cement pcl;<b> </b>Suranart Kittirattanadetch, R&amp;B Food Supply pcl; and Anuwat Ruamsuke, Kiatnakin Phatra Securities pcl. The panelists have shared experiences and perspectives regarding applying for BOI privileges &amp; benefits and effectively utilizing the capital market. The knowledge and information will greatly be useful for and inspire entrepreneurs, particularly those who are interested in applying for listing on SET or mai.</p>
<p>Notably, promoting businesses in the New Economy industry is part of SET's strategic plan to enhance product quality and diversity. In addition, this collaboration also includes encouraging current listed companies to consider and utilize various BOI privileges to enhance competitive capabilities, with readiness to drive the country towards the new economy. Moreover, this collaboration also incorporates the improvement of the service and application review processes of both entities to ensure faster service delivery for the benefit of the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>This collaboration between SET and BOI is a significant step in gearing up the Thai economy towards sustainable future through investment promotion and capital market mechanism. The New Economy businesses, as defined by SET&rsquo;s listing criteria based on the market capitalization, are companies operating businesses related to the target industries according to the categories entitled for the promotion specified by the BOI with focus on&nbsp;Bio-Circular-Green (BCG). These industries consist of advanced agriculture and food, biofuels and biochemicals, medical and healthcare extension, creative tourism, next-generation automotive, aviation and logistics, digital and e-commerce, smart electronics, robotics, as well as technology and innovation development.</p>

<title>REMIT Breach: Spanish Energy Regulator Fines Enet Energy S.A. €1 Million For Attempting To Manipulate The Wholesale Gas Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Spanish energy regulatory authority, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC), has imposed a &euro;1 million fine on Enet Energy S.A. for attempting to manipulate the national organised gas market (MIBGAS) eight times from April to May 2023. Enet Energy S.A.&nbsp;acknowledged its responsibility and proceeded with an early voluntary payment. Therefore, in accordance with Spanish regulations, a 40% reduction was applied to the imposed fine.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDUAcDAlQGUkwABAVTHVYBVAMdUFhXAxoGUQoGVwJTAVNUAQcdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation</a>&nbsp;prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>In its decision, CNMC found that Enet Energy S.A. had breached Article 5 of REMIT for attempting to manipulate the Spanish organised gas market. The market participant inserted sell orders at low prices and significantly high volumes around 17:30, to give false or misleading signals regarding the supply and price level at which gas was being traded at that specific moment of the trading session (17:30) in MIBGAS. This is the time at which market reference indices are calculated, including the market price index for natural gas traded at the Spanish Virtual Hub (PVB) by the agency ICIS HEREN.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the main findings?</span></p>
<p>The investigation showed that, in eight trading sessions of the Spanish day ahead gas market between 24 April and 18 May 2023, Enet Energy S.A. placed a large volume of sell orders around 17:30. Their low prices (ranging from -2.50 &euro;/MWh on 2 May to -16.00 &euro;/MWh on 17 May, compared to the sell price of the immediately preceding orders) caused a drop relative to the prevailing market trend in an attempt to influence the price references at that specific time. Seconds later, the market participant&nbsp;introduced new sell orders at higher prices (with a price increase over their offer at around 17:30, ranging from +2.00 &euro;/MWh on 24 April to +12.00 &euro;/MWh on 11 May), modifying in just a few seconds the price signal previously transmitted to the market.</p>
<p>CNMC concluded that Enet Energy S.A., through its sell orders at low prices and significantly high volumes, attempted to manipulate the Spanish organised gas market prices at the reference time used for calculating market indices, including the PVB reference price published by ICIS HEREN.</p>
<p>This is the fourth decision from CNMC sanctioning the manipulation or attempt of manipulation of a reference price on the Spanish gas market (see previous decisions in 2018&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUBQZXB1JdU0wNBgdTHVZfBAUdUw0JBxoEA1YFUgBWBFUID1cdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAAldTUQNcVkxbUg0CHVZcVwQdU1wCVRpWVwMFDQNUBA4AAgUdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, and in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAU1RTUgBSVUwAUwJVHVYBAAEdCw9VXhoAVQpRVwNQBg9QUlQdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024</a>).</p>

The first expected issuances are commercial papers (CPs) and medium-term notes (MTNs). Both these securities benefit strongly from the speed of issuance, allowing treasurers to generate funding on an intraday basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets, comments: &ldquo;This is a landmark achievement for Clearstream and the wider financial community. D7 is reinventing how securities are issued, managed, and traded, benefiting all market participants, providing the flexibility to choose between digital and tokenized issuance. The platform offers a unique combination of innovation and practicality, addressing current client needs while paving the way for the future of finance, advancing capital markets in Europe and globally.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google Cloud, a strategic innovation partner of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, enables D7 DLT with secure infrastructure, technical expertise, and cloud capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;Our collaboration with Clearstream on the D7 DLT platform is a powerful example of innovation in digital finance. By combining our secure and scalable infrastructure with Clearstream&rsquo;s expertise in distributed ledger technology, we&rsquo;re helping to redefine how securities are issued and managed. This platform is not just about meeting today&rsquo;s needs; it&rsquo;s also about building a more efficient, transparent, and secure future for capital markets globally,&rdquo; said Matt Renner, President, Global Revenue, at Google Cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Benefits of D7 DLT:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li><strong>Streamlined issuance and lifecycle management</strong>: The platform enables the issuance of tokenized securities directly onto the DLT, streamlining processes and reducing the complexity associated with traditional issuance methods.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced transparency and security</strong>: DLT provides an immutable and transparent record of ownership and transactions, enhancing security and reducing the risk of fraud. This builds trust and fosters greater efficiency in post-trade processing.</li>
<li><strong>Unparalleled accessibility and interoperability</strong>: The D7 DLT platform allows for unique seamless integration with existing market infrastructure, facilitating broader investor reach and interoperability for a wide range of international market participants. It will also integrate with trading venues such as Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s own 360X multi-lateral trading facility (MTF) which can service securities natively issued on DLT.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Successful live pilot use cases during 2024 ECB Trials</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>D7 DLT&rsquo;s launch follows successful trials conducted as part of the European Central Bank (ECB) Trials and Experiments in 2024. During these trials, Clearstream executed several live issuances with various partners, encompassing complex use cases and diverse asset classes such as commercial paper and intraday repo transactions. The successful demonstration of the platform&rsquo;s ability to manage both securities and central bank digital currency (CBDC) positions it for future scalability and innovation.</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-Uses-Table-November-2025.pdf">Sources and Uses Tables</a></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0300#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;for the October&ndash;December 2025 and January&ndash;March 2026 quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>During the October&ndash;December 2025 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $569 billion&nbsp;in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $850 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0300#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;The borrowing estimate is $21 billion lower than announced in July 2025,&nbsp;primarily due to the higher beginning-of-quarter cash balance, partially offset by lower projected net cash flows. Excluding the higher-than-assumed beginning-of-quarter cash balance, the current quarter borrowing estimate is $20 billion higher than announced in July.</li>
<li>During the January&ndash;March 2026&nbsp;quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $578 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $850 billion.</li>
<li>During the July&ndash;September 2025&nbsp;quarter, Treasury borrowed $1.058 trillion in privately-held &nbsp;net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $891 billion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In July 2025, Treasury estimated borrowing of $1.007 trillion and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $850 billion.&nbsp; The $50 billion difference in privately-held net marketable borrowing resulted primarily from the higher end-of-quarter cash balance and lower net cash flows. Excluding the higher-than-assumed end-of-quarter cash balance, actual borrowing was $10 billion higher than announced in July.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional financing details relating to Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 5, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Economy Statement For The US Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/economy-statement-for-the-us-treasury-borrowing-advisory-committee-2025113/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/economy-statement-for-the-us-treasury-borrowing-advisory-committee-2025113/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Economic data received through September 30, 2025, suggest that U.S. economic growth solidified in the third quarter of 2025 with steady business investment and consumer demand. Stock markets reached record highs during the quarter&mdash;and have set additional highs since&mdash;while earnings growth has been stable. Meanwhile, yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bills eased over the third quarter: the average yield on the 91-day bill was 11 basis points lower from the second quarter, while the 10-year note yield was 10 basis points lower. Yields have eased further over the last month, nearing 4.00 percent for both the 91-day and the 10-year issuances.</p>
<p>Labor markets stabilized in July and August, with modest employment growth consistent with that of the second quarter. Forced deportation and voluntary self-deportation of illegal immigrants has reduced labor supply, but labor demand has similarly decreased. This has kept aggregate labor markets roughly in balance. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be planning for output growth via productivity improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>
<p>Private-sector forecasters estimate that, given data released for July and August, total economic growth remained solid in the third quarter. According to the most recent publicly available survey (the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal&nbsp;quarterly survey published on October 12, 2025), the median forecast for third-quarter GDP growth was 2.7&nbsp;percent at an annual rate &ndash; an upswing from the July survey median of 1.0 percent annualized growth. This upward revision reflects monthly data that suggests strong private final domestic demand.</p>
<ul>
<li>In just the first two months of the quarter, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were up 2.8 percent at an annual rate, picking up modestly from the second quarter.</li>
<li>In addition, business shipments of core (nondefense and excluding aircraft) picked up to a 3.3 percent annualized growth rate in July and August from the second quarter.</li>
<li>Anecdotal and news reports suggest that research and development for artificial intelligence continues to propel business spending on intellectual property products.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lapse in government funding has delayed surveys and reports that are used to estimate GDP for the third quarter of 2025. As such, official data on real GDP growth last quarter will not be available until after normal government operations resume.</p>
<h3>Labor Markets</h3>
<p>Labor market data was relatively steady in the first two quarters of the third quarter (see Table 1 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators). Monthly job growth moderated slightly, while the average unemployment rate ticked up only slightly and the average headline labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Total payroll job growth averaged 51,000 per month during first two months of the third quarter of 2025, after averaging 55,000 per month during the second quarter. The slower growth from the second to third quarters, however, partly reflected the shedding of federal government jobs &ndash; with a monthly average decrease of 12,500 in federal employment. By contrast, private sector job creation remained steady at 58,000 jobs per month in July and August. Although this growth rate is below the roughly 100,000 jobs added per month in the first quarter of 2025&nbsp;it likely reflects the drop in population growth related to the forced and self-deportation of illegal immigrants. A lower population growth leads to a lower breakeven rate of payroll job growth&mdash;that is, the pace of net hiring needed to maintain a steady unemployment rate.</li>
<li>From May 2024 to July 2025, monthly unemployment rates fluctuated within a narrow range of 4.0 percent and 4.2 percent. In August, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3 percent of the labor force, and the average for July and August was 4.29 percent. Nonetheless, unemployment rates in the third quarter remained just below the Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s 4.4 percent estimate of the non-cyclical unemployment rate&mdash;or the rate of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation and excludes fluctuations in aggregate demand.</li>
<li>The labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down in the second quarter &ndash; though the more salient prime-age working force participation rate ticked up. On average in July and August, the overall LFPR eased to an average of 62.3 percent, primarily reflecting lower participation by the ages 16 to 24 worker cohort. The average participation rate by below-prime workers was down by 1.7 percentage points in July and August from the first quarter of 2025. In addition, persistent broader demographic trends from the retirement of Baby Boomers contributed to the slight, 0.1 percentage point decrease in the LFPR for those of age 55 years or older. By contrast, the prime-age LFPR &ndash; that is, participation by workers ages 25 to 54 years old &ndash; increased to an average 83.6 percent in the third quarter.</li>
<li>In the available data for the third quarter, labor demand as measured by job openings eased, but it remained relatively stable after adjusting for the number of available unemployed workers. During July and August, there was an average of 7.2 million job openings per month, down from 7.5 million on average in the second quarter. However, the ratio of job openings (or vacancies) per unemployed worker remained steady at 1.0 vacancies per unemployed person.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, layoffs and discharges remained low. Private-sector layoffs and discharges accounted for just 1.3 percent of employment in July and August, in line with the low rates that persisted during President&rsquo;s first term before the pandemic.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation</h3>
<p>Inflation remained above the target of 2 percent in the third quarter (see Table 2 &ndash; Inflation Indicators). As of September 2025, inflation&mdash;as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI)&mdash;was 3.0 percent on a twelve-month basis. The elevated annual growth partly reflects the strong price pressures from September 2024 to January 2025, in which headline CPI rose by 4.1 percent at an annualized rate. From January 2025 to September 2025, CPI growth was more moderate at 2.5 percent at an annual rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>CPI inflation for energy goods and services picked in the third quarter to an average 0.4 percent per month, after rising an average 0.2 percent per month in the second quarter. The increase in energy prices largely reflected higher gasoline prices.</li>
<li>Food prices for both groceries (food at home) and food services (food away from home) increased moderately in the third quarter. The CPI for food at home rose 0.3 percent per month on average, while the CPI for food away from home increased an average of 0.2 percent per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monthly core CPI inflation averaged 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Over the twelve months through September 2025, the core inflation rate was 3.0 percent. So far this year, annual core inflation has ranged between 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent, save for the 3.3 percent rating realized in January from when President Trump assumed office.</p>
<ul>
<li>Core goods prices increased 0.2 percent on average per month in the third quarter, ticking up 0.1 percentage points from the rates in the previous three quarters. Core goods prices began rising in September 2024, which has elevated core goods inflation to 1.5 percent over the year ending September 2025.</li>
<li>Inflation for rent of housing services (rent of primary residence and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent) averaged 0.3 percent per month in the third quarter, where it has held for the previous three quarters. Over the year through September 2025, rent of housing inflation was 3.7 percent, the slowest annual pace since December 2021.</li>
<li>Inflation for non-housing core services picked up to 0.3 percent on average in the third quarter, with about half of the growth stemming from higher prices for airfares and lodging away from home. Over the year through September 2025, non-housing core services inflation was 3.8 percent, down from 5.2 percent over the year through September 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index has notable differences in weights and methodologies versus the CPI. Over the past 20 years, twelve-month CPI inflation has exceeded PCE inflation by about 0.36&nbsp;percentage points on average. Over the year through August 2025, headline PCE inflation was 2.7 percent, or 0.2 percentage points below headline CPI inflation for that month. Similarly, core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent, below the 3.1 percent inflation rate as measured by the CPI.</p>
<h3>Risks to the Outlook</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks. However, on balance, economists view the risk of a recession as relatively low. According to The Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s quarterly survey of economists, the median economist projected a 33 percent chance of a recession in the next twelve months, little changed from the 35 percent chance estimated by the median economist in the July survey.</p>
<p><em>Federal government shutdown</em>: As of October 31, the federal government has been shut down for over four weeks, and the lapse in government funding is likely to continue for at least a fifth week. The shutdown reduces current quarter GDP growth through several channels: a direct channel of lost output from furloughed workers, a secondary consumption channel as excepted and furloughed federal workers await delayed paychecks, and ancillary impacts on complementary industries (such as government contractors and local services). Each week of this unnecessary shutdown adds drag to fourth quarter GDP and introduces downside risk to the near-term outlook.</p>
<p><em>Labor markets</em>: Excluding the shutdown, declining government employment may create a headwind for labor markets in the fourth quarter of 2025. Roughly 150,000 federal employees opted into the Deferred Resignation Program to be put on administrative leave through September 30, 2025, after which they would voluntarily separate from the federal government. Thus, the employment report for October could show a decline in total payroll employment unless these employees had their resignation date postponed, were recalled from administrative leave upon agency reconsideration of staffing needs, or had found replacement jobs. The drag on job growth, however, could be mitigated to the extent that employees found other employment.</p>
<p>Aside from the government sector, Treasury is monitoring private-sector labor market developments closely. Although employment growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2025, data do not indicate the slower growth is a result of soft GDP growth or weakening aggregate demand. Rather, labor supply and labor demand appear to have softened at the same time, leading to soft hiring without a sharp rise in unemployment. This is likely due to a lower breakeven rate of payroll job growth given the sharp drop in population growth that accompanied the Administration&rsquo;s enforcement of immigration law.</p>
<p>Indeed, labor markets appear to remain in balance as labor demand has softened with easing supply. Since early 2022, the private sector hires rate has trended lower and was 3.5 percent as of August 2025, comparable to the slow recovery from the 2007 to 2009 recession. Even so, layoff rates also remain low with the private-sector layoff and discharges rate at just 1.2 percent in August 2025, below the 1.6 percent average from 2001 to 2019, just before the pandemic. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be shedding labor via attrition and planning on productivity to drive output growth. Further supporting for the continued balance in the labor market at a lower breakeven rate is the stable, low levels of initial and continuing jobless claims.</p>
<p>Energy prices and geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical uncertainty, such as the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, continues to add upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook.&nbsp;Energy prices are one of the most volatile categories of inflation, with geopolitical events leading to large swings in the energy prices. For example, the CPI for gasoline rose 3.7 percent (15.9 percent at an annual rate) from June to September, accounting for over 10 percent of quarterly CPI inflation. High energy prices eventually feed through to other consumer goods and services, such as food (through fertilizer and fuel for farming equipment) and airfares.</p>
<p><em>Artificial intelligence</em>: Firms&rsquo; continued investment in artificial intelligence has significant potential to be a catalyst for productivity and economic growth&mdash;particularly for efficiency gains in service-sector industries where productivity growth historically has been slower than manufacturing industries. However, the timeline for when such boosts are realized, as well as the magnitude of said impetus, is still uncertain. If the integration of artificial intelligence boosts growth as a standard technology improvements, the productivity growth could return to historical norms after several years of above-trend growth. On the other hand, artificial intelligence could prove transformational and permanently upshift the path of productivity as it enables workers to build skills and human capital faster than in the past.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence also could have disruptive impacts on the economy and labor markets as businesses and individuals integrate it or fail to. Firms that are slow to adapt to the technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, as could workers that delay incorporating artificial intelligence to improve their skills growth and productivity.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thus far in President Trump&rsquo;s second term, the Administration has successfully stewarded major fiscal legislation to prevent a historic tax increase, and it continues to seek further cuts to federal spending and incentivize productive business investment. Ongoing trade negotiations are transforming trade relationships, which will put American citizens first and prevent other countries from taking advantage of the openness of our economy. Moreover, supply-side policies, deregulation, and other reforms will protect the American consumer from high inflation, supply-chain disruptions, and the destabilizing potential of geo-political strife while freeing up investment funds for more productive uses and encouraging a significant increase in domestic energy production. In just a short six months, the Administration has made extensive progress to enact an agenda that will bring prosperity to all Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Survey of up to eighty large domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve generally conducts the survey quarterly, timing it so that results are available for the January/February, April/May, August, and October/November meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve occasionally conducts one or two additional surveys during the year. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans. The survey often includes questions on one or two other topics of current interest.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, David. I appreciate the opportunity to speak again at the Brookings Institution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20251103a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is always an honor for me to return to the place where I held my first job as an aspiring economist. I had the good fortune to be a research assistant for the eminent economist and public servant, including as Vice Chair of the Fed, Alice Rivlin early in my career. It was a formative, if not transformative, experience for me, and I remain grateful to her and Brookings for it.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak to you about how I see the U.S. economic outlook evolving, specifically through the lens of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability. Then, I will discuss how my assessment of the outlook guides my thinking on monetary policy.</p>
<p>I will start by acknowledging that, due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech. Federal statistical agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, have not produced many of the data I regularly use in assessing the economy, such as monthly employment data from BLS and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index from BEA. The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />However, we are not flying blind. The staff at the Federal Reserve and I use a wide variety of data from administrative sources and various private-sector providers to continually evaluate the state of the economy in real time. That practice has become essential in recent weeks given the lack of official releases. These data include alternative measures of inflation, labor-market activity, and production and spending, inflation. For example, states continue to report data on unemployment insurance (UI) claims, and online job boards provide data on available positions. Various firms provide pricing data on a variety of products and services, including housing and vehicles, and offer information on credit card spending, the moods of consumers and employers, and manufacturing and service-sector output. In my first speech as a Governor in 2022, I encouraged the use of more high-frequency, real-time data from the private sector, and I think this has borne fruit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20251103a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;And, of course, the Reserve Banks in the Fed System are a rich source of statistical and anecdotal data, some of which are documented in the Beige Book report policymakers receive before each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, I find broad outreach to business leaders, workers, nonprofits, and families around the country essential in understanding the state of the economy. I will rely on this outreach, these alternative data sources, and the latest available federal data when discussing my outlook today.</p>
<p><em>Inflation</em><br />First, I will turn to inflation. Based on the available data for September, it is estimated that the PCE price index rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months ending in September, significantly above our 2 percent target. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, was also estimated to be 2.8 percent. Both of these readings are as high or higher than their readings a year before, propped up by an increase in tariff-affected goods prices.</p>
<p>My outreach to business leaders suggests that the pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices is not yet complete. Many firms have adopted a strategy of running down their inventories at lower price levels before raising prices. Others have reported waiting until tariff uncertainty is resolved before passing increases on to consumers. New car models, clothing lines, and other products will be coming onto the market, and that process will continue to provide firms with an opportunity to level set prices. As such, I expect inflation to remain elevated for the next year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase. It is encouraging that most long-run inflation expectations, including from the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, are low and stable at this juncture. When excluding tariff effects, 12-month core PCE inflation through September appears to be about 1/2 percentage point lower at about 2.3 percent, suggesting that underlying inflation has continued to make progress toward target. My assessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2 percent once the tariff effects are behind us. The big caveat is that tariff effects must prove not to be persistent and that monetary policy remains appropriately focused on achieving that goal.</p>
<p>This is a point worth dwelling on for just a moment. The FOMC's firm commitment to its inflation mandate is imperative to ensure that inflation does remain in check, as I do expect in my baseline forecast. So let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2 percent inflation target. Moreover, I will be prepared to act forcefully, if the tariff effects appear to be larger or last longer than expected, or if other evidence emerges that higher levels of inflation are becoming entrenched in expectations.</p>
<p><em>Labor market</em><br />I will now turn to the labor market. We have less recent official data on the labor market, but the latest available indicators suggest that the labor market remains solid, though gradually cooling. The unemployment rate edged up over this summer from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in August, a relatively low reading one would expect to see in a healthy economy. To put 4.3 percent into perspective, the average unemployment rate over the 50-year period preceding the pandemic was 6.2 percent. Since August, more recent labor-market indicators, such as UI claims, job postings, and individuals' assessments of job availability, signal little change to the August reading&mdash;at most a small uptick. Taken together, the slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention slowing in payroll gains observed over the summer. In most cases, a sharp slowing in payrolls would suggest increasing slack and would generally be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate. However, in this instance, the slowing in payrolls can mostly be explained by a coincident decline in population growth due to immigration policy. Because they are currently driven by fluctuations in population growth, the payroll numbers do not provide a definitive signal about labor-market slack. Therefore, it would be prudent for us to consult the other indicators I already mentioned.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that there appear to be worsening outcomes for vulnerable and low-to-middle-income (LMI) households. In the labor market, youth and Black unemployment rates, both of which tend to be more cyclical than total unemployment, have steadily risen since this spring through the latest readings in August. The deteriorating labor market experienced by these two vulnerable groups mirrors other emerging strains in some households' financial health and balance sheets. Among LMI households, we have observed large increases in delinquencies, especially last year, and there is some evidence that their spending has stagnated, in particular compared to the robust spending growth of their higher-income counterparts. This is sometimes called a "two-speed" economy, when the well-off are doing well, while LMI and vulnerable households are not.</p>
<p>Monetary policy works by affecting conditions for the entire economy and is not well suited to produce specific outcomes for specific groups of people. Ultimately, I believe delivering on our dual-mandate goals will produce the best outcomes for all Americans. Nonetheless, it is important for policymakers to monitor the two-speed economy. Understanding the challenges faced by so many Americans underscores the reasons why we need to get monetary policy right. Vulnerable and LMI households are the ones who will be the first and most hurt, if the labor market were to suddenly deteriorate or if inflation were to remain too high.</p>
<p><em>Economic activity</em><br />To turn to economic activity, recent readings are consistent with solid overall growth. Output has been supported by household consumption that has held up better than expected earlier this year. Yet, what has been more striking is the strength of business investment. Business investment has been driven by investment in high-tech equipment and software, seemingly mostly related to AI. As I have mentioned in previous speeches, that suggests to me there is a reason to be sanguine about future productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20251103a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I see AI as a general-purpose technology, on par with the steam engine and the personal computer, that has the&nbsp;<em>potential</em>&nbsp;to transform the economy and boost productivity. I expect this sector to continue to provide support to output growth over the next few years, at least.</p>
<p>In the very near term, I see the federal government shutdown as weighing on activity this quarter. Furloughing federal workers and forgoing government purchases of goods and services, including those provided by contractors, directly lowers output in the public sector. And spillover effects to the private sector are worth considering. Potential delays in government payments, permits, inspections, insurance provision and other functions could slow certain spending and investment activities, and some small business contractors with very little cushion may never be paid and may ultimately close their businesses. I see both sets of effects as being largely temporary. It is anticipated that they would unwind in the following quarter after the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>In summary, after a temporary slowdown due to the government shutdown, I expect the economy to grow moderately over the medium term, supported by an AI productivity boom. I see the labor market as still solid, but I am highly attentive to downside risks. I see inflation as remaining somewhat elevated due to tariff effects and subject to upside risks.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Having articulated my outlook, I will turn to my current view of monetary policy. At the FOMC meeting last week, I supported the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the fed funds rate by a quarter-point to 3-3/4 to 4 percent. I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization. I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>At last week's meeting, I also supported the decision to conclude the reduction of the aggregate securities holdings on the balance sheet on December 1. The long-stated plan had been to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves were somewhat above the level the Committee deemed consistent with ample reserve conditions. In the several weeks ahead of our latest meeting, signs, such as an increase in repo rates relative to administered rates, did emerge suggesting this standard had been reached. These developments were anticipated as the size of the balance sheet declined and supported the decision to cease runoff.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path. We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated. Keeping rates too high increases the likelihood that the labor market will deteriorate sharply. Lowering rates too much would increase the likelihood that inflation expectations will become unanchored. As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks. Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to return to Brookings. I look forward to our conversation.</p>
