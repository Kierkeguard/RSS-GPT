<title>Federal Reserve Board Finalizes Changes To Its Supervisory Rating Framework For Large Bank Holding Companies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday finalized changes to its supervisory rating framework for large bank holding companies. The finalized framework is substantially similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250710a.htm">proposal</a>&nbsp;issued in July.</p>
<p>The revisions contained in the finalized framework more accurately reflect the strength of individual banks and better align the finalized framework with supervisory rating systems used for other banking organizations.</p>
<p>The Board's large bank supervisory rating framework, issued in 2018, evaluates whether these firms have sufficient financial and operational strength and resilience to maintain safe-and-sound operations and comply with laws and regulations through a range of conditions. The framework includes three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.</p>
<p>"Bank ratings should reflect overall safety and soundness, not just isolated deficiencies in a single component," said Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman. "These framework changes address this by helping to ensure that overall firm condition is the primary consideration in a bank's rating."</p>
<p>The finalized framework will now consider a firm with no more than one deficient-1 rating to be "well managed." Consistent with the prior framework, a firm with a deficient-2 rating for any component will continue to be considered not well managed. Firms that are not well managed face limitations on certain activities and acquisitions.</p>
<p>The Board also finalized similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers regulated by the Board.</p>
<p>The revisions contained in the finalized framework will take effect 60 days after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;">At the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://events.sifma.org/annual" rel="noopener" style="font-size: 11px;" target="_blank">2025 SIFMA Annual Meeting</a><span style="font-size: 11px;">, Acting CFTC Chair Caroline D. Pham joined SIFMA President and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. to discuss her agenda: modernizing the CFTC, aligning with the SEC on market structure, and accelerating responsible innovation in digital assets and tokenization.</span></p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Back to Basics, Built to Deliver:&nbsp;</span>Pham set three near-term goals: revitalize the agency, recalibrate enforcement, and clean up legacy Dodd-Frank frictions. In her first 100 days, she issued &gt;20 staff letters/advisories (e.g., FX product definitions, cross-border treatment) and retooled enforcement with materiality thresholds.</li>
<li><span>SEC&ndash;CFTC Harmonization:&nbsp;</span>With &ldquo;tone from the top&rdquo; alignment, Pham is pursuing a blank-sheet view of optimal U.S. market structure&mdash;prioritizing&nbsp;<span>portfolio margining</span>&nbsp;(critical for Treasuries/clearing), technical fixes across swaps vs. security-based swaps, and practical exemptive tools to improve liquidity and capital efficiency.</li>
<li><span>The CFTC &ldquo;Crypto Sprint&rdquo;:&nbsp;</span>Pham aims to&nbsp;<em>bring crypto inside the regulatory perimeter</em>:  
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Listed spot crypto</span>&nbsp;trading on a CFTC-registered futures exchange targeted by year-end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Tokenized collateral guidance</span>&nbsp;(incl. stablecoins/T-bills/MMFs for OTC use) planned by year-end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Stablecoins as eligible collateral</span>&nbsp;at DCOs targeted for 1H next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rulemaking next year to propose technical amendments (margin, collateral, clearing, settlement, recordkeeping/reporting) enabling blockchain-based market infrastructure&mdash;tracking PWG recommendations on digital assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Cost, Capital, Competitiveness:&nbsp;</span>Further cross-border harmonization (capital, margin, collateral) could free tens of billions in balance-sheet capacity for lending and growth&mdash;without sacrificing risk controls.</li>
<li><span>Product Innovation with Guardrails:&nbsp;</span>Expect renewed product development (e.g., Bitcoin index options) where listing venues and uses (hedging, risk management) are matched to public-interest outcomes and market integrity.</li>
<li><span>Agency Transformation:&nbsp;</span>Pham detailed an internal overhaul: new KPIs and performance plan, ~$50M in annualized savings, first-ever performance bonuses, upgraded surveillance, and recruiting market-seasoned leaders (markets, research, surveillance, examinations) to meet an expanded mission.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Speakers</span></h4>

<h4><span>Transcript</span></h4>
<p><span>Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr.:</span>&nbsp;Chairman Pham, thank you for being with us today. Always great to have you. And I think this is maybe the third time I&rsquo;ve seen you in a week. You were at our global board last week. I know you were meeting with our committees yesterday, so thank you very much for that. We&rsquo;ll just get right into it. You&rsquo;ve provided firsthand market experience to rulemaking, which I think is terribly important. You understand how the industry works, and that&rsquo;s really, I think really helped inform you in how the agency can work. How are you thinking about it with all the things you&rsquo;re doing? You&rsquo;ve talked about previously some cleanup around Dodd-Frank. You&rsquo;ve got various staff actions, rulemaking, et cetera. What are your current priorities?</p>
<p><span>Acting Chairman Caroline Pham:</span>&nbsp;Well, thank you so much for having me here. It&rsquo;s really just a pleasure. And I remember coming to attend the SIFMA Annual Meeting. So what an honor to be up here on the stage this year. It has been a exhilarating year. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun. There&rsquo;s been so much that has happened. And one of the things that I was known for in my private sector career when I was at Citi was really strategy and transformation. I like to joke that I&rsquo;m like the mailman, I always deliver. And so in January I set forth the key goals for my acting chairmanship. And so it was to really do three things that I saw were critical and that I had made many proposals about when I was a Commissioner, number one, help to fix the agency, help to revitalize and modernize the agency as the administration asked me to do.</p>
<p>Number two, to fix the enforcement program and number three, to fix Dodd-Frank. Just a small thing fixed Dodd-Frank. But just like you said, having implemented Dodd-Frank, having been the global head of swap dealer compliance and Volcker compliance and having worked on global regulatory reform enterprise wide, when you understand how the processes work, when you see how the rules leave a lot of room for interpretation, that kind of rolling up your sleeves and just jumping right into it absolutely has informed the approach that I&rsquo;ve taken as a leader. And so I&rsquo;m really pleased to say that in our first 100 days we have made significant process accomplished much of what I had originally set out to do. We have issued over two dozen staff letters, advisories and other guidance that helps to fix long-standing issues like FX product definitions or the cross-border treatment of swaps and US persons.</p>
<p>We have completely restructured the enforcement program. We&rsquo;ve created materiality thresholds for non-compliance issues. I overheard somebody talking about the WhatsApp communication enforcement actions. I completely agree that those really went far beyond what was appropriate and I had a number of dissents in that space. And of course getting the agency ready, which we&rsquo;ll talk about more later, but getting the agency ready to really take on its new and expanded mission. So the priorities in the near term are to continue working on some of the Dodd-Frank issues, particularly the Dodd-Frank cross-border issues. So there are continuing things that I think we can do around capital relief, margin relief, collateral treatment, and much of it also relates to cross-border harmonization. So there&rsquo;s just still things where we can be much more efficient. I think I am not understating it when I estimate that I might be able to fix some of these long-standing issues that might provide over 25 billion of savings across the banking industry for all the major dealers.</p>
<p>That is all capital that can be redeployed on the balance sheet to support the economy, to support growth, much more productive uses. And so that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m very excited about working on and hopefully getting done before the end of the year. The other major priority that we have, of course is the SEC-CFDC, harmonization work-stream, which we will talk more about. And then crypto, crypto, crypto. I have been charged with making America the crypto capital of the world. And so we&rsquo;ll also talk more about some of the specific milestones and plans that we have in that space as well.</p>
<p>And then just overall, this administration made promises they are delivering on their promises. Some of the key ones that I looked at were looking at bringing down the cost of living for everyday Americans that depend upon the physical commodities that are the inputs that are in our markets. Number two, to improve the flow of credit to US businesses and US households and three, to unleash US energy production. So overarching, those are also three key goals that the administration had charged me with back in January.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:&nbsp;</span>That&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s great. So you mentioned CFTC-SEC harmonization. Your colleague Chairman Atkins was just on stage this morning. What was it two weeks ago, three weeks ago, the CFTC and SEC, Chairman Atkins, and you convened a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sec-cftc-joint-roundtable-sept-29-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">joint roundtable</a>&nbsp;to talk about the history and the future with respect to harmonization of the two agencies. I had the pleasure of serving on the first panel that I think your predecessor, Christian Carlos said was the old timers panel. Thank you Chris for that. And perhaps it&rsquo;s true, but you also, you bring a very unique experience as well because you grew up on the fixed income trading floor. You then go into overseeing regulatory affairs and compliance at a major firm that&rsquo;s both many things, but also a broker dealer, FCM, DCM, et cetera. You now oversee the futures industry, the swaps area, most of it. So you bring a really interesting perspective. You&rsquo;ve had to deal with both agencies as a practitioner and the regulatory framework. How do you see this unfold?</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m very optimistic. It&rsquo;s actually been such an honor and such a pleasure to be able to work together with Chairman Atkins because he&rsquo;s one of my mentors. I&rsquo;ve known him for about 15 years. So what an honor to kind of be able to work with one of your heroes. Seeing his record as an SEC commissioner, just the pragmatism really set a great standard for how we should approach our jobs when we are at these regulatory agencies, which have a tremendous impact on the markets and on the economy and on the world. So the other thing that is interesting is that I actually was an intern, not just at the CFTC, so I also feel like I&rsquo;m an old-timer because I started at the CFTC in 2009 as an intern enforcement, but then I went and actually interned at the SEC in enforcement after that. And so having that inside perspective of actually how each building works and how to navigate it, there&rsquo;s a very different culture between the CFTC and the SEC.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s also very important for any harmonization effort really to be able to put yourself into the shoes of the staff at each respective agency and understand what their focus is on. And then also just process. There is a lot of process at the SEC and being able to understand that and how things get to the 10th floor is critical. And of course, having had enterprise-wide roles and overseeing all capital markets in all regions, particularly for regulatory strategy, really has informed a lot of how I think about the harmonization. So I&rsquo;m very optimistic because you have the right tone from the top, right. You have strong leadership from Chairman Atkins and from myself where we know what is possible, but again, we have to ensure that there is the will to follow through on it. And I think we have that will.</p>
<p>And I also feel like there is a renewed sense of purpose and mission where we are getting back to basics, which is kind of the theme of my chairmanship that I set in January was we need to get back to basics and we need to get to regular order. Another thematic approach to how we think about the SEC and CPC harmonization, and this is what I said back during the roundtable, imagine if you could take a blank piece of paper and you could come up with a market structure that is the best for liquidity formation and for capital efficiency and never mind all these artificial constraints and sort of these turf wars and all of these other issues, but just what would that optimal market structure be for well-functioning deep in liquid markets? And then let&rsquo;s see how far we can get there using each of our respective authorities and using our exemptive relief if necessary Innovation exemptions fits into that area.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re going to see a level of product innovation that we probably have not seen in our market since the nineties, to be honest, because having that open-mindedness about wanting to go back and revisit different product types or how to ensure that we can have new products come to market that are successful or have new markets develop. I think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very exciting and it will again, lead to a general renaissance that will help to promote our US economic growth. What are some specific examples I&rsquo;m talking about? So during that roundtable, Adena Friedman, CEO of NASDAQ talked about Bitcoin index options, Bitcoin index options in indexes as a commodity. So that would normally be required to trade only on a DCM, but why shouldn&rsquo;t we think about letting that trade on a national securities exchange? Because then you can use it for hedging and risk management purposes. It&rsquo;s much more efficient, you can net it out.</p>
<p>So being able to think about what&rsquo;s really in the public interest and what&rsquo;s really best for market functioning I think is something that&rsquo;s going to be exciting. There&rsquo;s other elements of the harmonization that is more technical and I&rsquo;m happy to get into that, but it is really thinking about some of the swap and security-based swap delineation, right? If you&rsquo;re nine or less components, you&rsquo;re over on the security-based swap side. If you&rsquo;re 10 plus, they&rsquo;re over on the swap side. It&rsquo;s challenging. I mean, it&rsquo;s a bright line, but it&rsquo;s still challenging. So if we can do something to rationalize and harmonize a lot of these technical requirements, I think that&rsquo;s going to go a very long way.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;So you mentioned, following up on that, you mentioned Dodd-Frank clean up and you&rsquo;ve talked about margin capital rules and CFTC went really quick 15 years ago post passage to Dodd-Frank, SEC, a little more methodical, deliberative, but now those rules have started to converge. And so do you see some of that happening? Another area that we&rsquo;ve talked about before, portfolio margining, which is now going to be very important when we&rsquo;re thinking about treasury clearing, et cetera. Are these things you can see the commission, your commission moving forward and working in conjunction with the other commission?</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;Absolutely. Especially because I am the commission.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;The commission of one.</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;Yes. So portfolio margining is absolutely a top priority and not just for the treasury market, which is the entire world runs on US treasuries. This is the most critical market for the financial system and just the most important market. So yes, absolutely that&rsquo;s a high priority.</p>
<p>But more generally speaking, again, this goes to some of the structural limitations that I&rsquo;ve been talking about that for decades, you&rsquo;ve got this artificial delineation. And there&rsquo;s important reasons, but you&rsquo;ve got your FCM 4d account, you&rsquo;ve got your broker dealer 15c3-3 account. Are there ways that we can try to improve, again, sort of the capital and margin efficiency across there? So I think portfolio margining is definitely probably number one on the list of things that we want to work on. Harmonizing.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous body of work that has been done by associations like SIFMA and other industry market participants on all of the pain points for swaps and security-based swaps. So we certainly have, I think a laundry list that we can work through. It&rsquo;s certainly have our work cut out for us, but I think portfolio margining definitely at the top of the list. But besides the efficiency piece of it, again, I still want to emphasize we&rsquo;re very much also focused on the product innovation piece as well.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;So I want to shift to that and it&rsquo;s still on point if you think about it, you talked about crypto and the work, and I want to get into that the CFTC is doing there, but I would note I think that, and Chairman Atkins is making a similar point as the agencies do their work, as Congress does its work, there&rsquo;re going to be certain things just like in the swap space, there&rsquo;re going to be certain things that are under the purview of the CFTC, certain things under the purview of the SEC and also some under the Prudential regulators. So again, like we went through in the swap series, there&rsquo;s going to be a demand for coordination and collaboration. So the CFTC launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9104-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crypto sprint</a>, I think you coined it to facilitate the listing of spot crypto contracts on CFTC-registered futures exchanges. How&rsquo;s that working? Where do you want that to go?</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s going great. I&rsquo;m very excited about it. So again, coming back to the mission that I was asked to deliver on the promises that I was to deliver on for the administration, obviously crypto, very top of the list, but I also had a lot of work doing product development, business development, regulatory strategy, exam strategy, et cetera in digital assets. I had been working on digital assets at the CFTC back in 2013 and then at Citi I started working on it in 2017. So needless to say, I came into being a commissioner with a very clear vision about what was necessary to enable tokenization in our markets, blockchain-based market infrastructure, and then also how do we treat crypto as a novel asset class. So for the roadmap, so the president&rsquo;s working group report on digital asset markets was the administration&rsquo;s crypto roadmap. It set forth a number of very specific recommendations.</p>
<p>And so for the CFTC&rsquo;s portion of the recommendations, since I of course wrote them and submitted them to the working group with my team, we are going to get all of the CFTC-specific recommendations in the PWG report done by next August. So set forth like a 12-month implementation timeline for those. The first stage of that was the listed spot crypto on our registered futures exchanges. So for probably at least 10 years, the international regulatory community has had is its mantra that we must bring crypto inside the regulatory perimeter. What better way to bring it inside the regulatory perimeter than to put it on our highly regulated futures and securities exchanges, which have been proven for a hundred years plus to be the best for, again, liquidity formation for efficiency, for investor protection, for best execution, for transparency, this is the gold standard hour registered and regulated exchanges.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re doing. I expect that we will be live with listed spot crypto trading on at least one of our designated contract markets, our futures exchanges by the end of the year. It&rsquo;s a crypto sprint. I&rsquo;m very serious about that. So we are moving quickly, but also the CFTC does have a principle-based regulatory framework, which does give us that flexibility to adapt and anticipate changes in market structure, evolving and emerging risks, so on and so forth. So listed spot crypto live trading on one of our futures exchanges by the end of the year. I also would, I&rsquo;m planning on having something announced, issued some type of, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe an advisory, maybe a guidance, maybe something else. But we will issue something on tokenized collateral by the end of the year, particularly as it relates to OTC markets. So that&rsquo;s another one of the big initiatives that I announced.</p>
<p>I announced a effort to enable tokenized collateral in our markets, including stablecoins, and I announced that together with some of the largest industry participants in the space, both stablecoin issuers as well as regulated crypto trading platforms. So that&rsquo;s very exciting. Those are by the end of the year in first or second quarter of next year, I expect that we will have some of our derivatives clearing organizations. DCOs are registered clearing houses enabling stablecoins as collateral again, first or second quarter of next year. And then the other piece that we have to the crypto sprint is I opened a consultation on about a half dozen or so rules that may need some technical amendments to enable tokenization and blockchain-based market infrastructure.</p>
<p>So margin, collateral, clearing, settlement, record-keeping, reporting. And so that consultation period closes later this year. It&rsquo;s a little bit extended because of the government shutdown. And so I think the CFTC can do a rulemaking, one rulemaking next year, the first six months of next year to propose those technical amendments, get public comment, and then issue a final rule by August, which then we will have completed implementing all of the PWG recommendations for the CFTC. So that&rsquo;s the crypto sprint.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;One thing I was going to ask you about the collateral, but one thing that I neglected to mention at the outset, but I want to ask you about, so before you became acting Chairman as a commissioner, you chaired the Global Markets Advisory committee and our global partner GFMA had the opportunity to participate on both the full committee and some of the subcommittees. You did a lot of work on that committee leading up to this point, right? You did the taxonomy around digital assets. How much of that work of the GMAC has informed your ability mean, would it be fair to say you were already sprinting before you started the sprint that you had? I mean, is a lot of that GMAC work coming into fruition at this point?</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;Absolutely. So again, I was particularly known for strategy and transformation. I love a project plan. So yes, I put together a number of deliverables and milestones that I thought it would be great to achieve, and we have just methodically gone through and ticked those off. So I was immensely proud to relaunch the CFTC&rsquo;s Global Markets Advisory Committee, which is about having a level playing field for global businesses and global markets. And I want to thank and AFMI as well as the other trade associations, many of your firms here in this room who have committed not only your most senior leaders, but your time and resources to supporting the work of the GMAC. So given my perspective being at a global international bank like Citi, everything that I worked on was very much about global markets, and a lot of it was dealing with market fragmentation and other issues like that.</p>
<p>So because of that experience that I had working so closely with the global markets business, but then also at one point in time, I oversaw all of Citi&rsquo;s participation in all of the trade associations that Citi is a member of. So I sort of built my own Uber trade association, I suppose, like industry organization, and was really able to leverage. We had over across the GMAC in its three subcommittees, global market structure, digital asset markets and technical issues, over 125 members. It&rsquo;s the largest single advisory committee initiative ever at the CFTC. And these are all sector leaders, segment leaders, the most preeminent firms in each of their spaces, the sell side, the buy side, the service providers, the FMIs. Also, we had digital or crypto natives, and we put out recommendations about 14 recommendations that span all the issues that are most impactful, most significant to global markets.</p>
<p>So in many ways, the scope of the GMAC mirrors the FSB agenda. My scope at Citi was very broad, and so when I came back to the CFTC, I basically wanted to blow my scope back out to what I liked doing and why not. But it was great because we were to tackle issues like treasury market reform, T plus one, security settlement, looking at issues around capital margin and clearing in wholesale markets and how to make that more efficient. We looked at systemic risk and using the data that we&rsquo;ve been collecting since Dodd-Frank and how to enable that data so that regulators could, for example, try to spot buildups or issues like ARCHAIGOS in the data that we&rsquo;re already collecting. A lot of that ties into the NBFI work that the international regulatory community is focused on and so on and so forth. Because if you think about it, look, we regulate derivatives markets.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s every asset class. There&rsquo;s an underlying every asset class in derivatives markets. And so that&rsquo;s why I looked at all of the asset classes. So all of that GMAC work has informed what we have done all year this year, right, because I mean, that was the whole point was to have the GMAC propose solutions that were pragmatic and that could be implemented. And now I&rsquo;ve been implementing them. We have gone through and implemented all the GMAC recommendations that the CFTC would require action by the CFTC and is something that we could accomplish this year. I had gridlock. I was not able to move anything through the commission because there was no majority until September 4th after the departure of my colleague.</p>
<p>So you may have noticed that right on September 4th, many things were issued by the CFTC, and that&rsquo;s because we were able to break through the gridlock. And then for the crypto asset space, yes, we had the tokenized non-cash collateral recommendation by the Digital Asset Market subcommittee last November. That in a large part, very much did focus on tokenized treasury money market funds. But the learnings there and the principles there are broadly applicable to include stable coins as well. And then the taxonomy work also informed what was in the president&rsquo;s working group.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;So maybe to bring us back home here as we finish up to the work you did at the GMAC, laid out your agenda, but you&rsquo;ve also, since you have become acting chairman, you&rsquo;ve also in effect restructured the agency and both how it operates, how it engages, similar to what you did with the GMAC, how it engages with its stakeholders. Maybe talk us through a little bit of that.</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;Yeah. So I think one of the things that I&rsquo;m most proud of is the work that I&rsquo;ve done to really revitalize the CFTC and to bring back the agency that I remember working at, starting back in 2009. And I was at the agency during Chairman Gensler&rsquo;s tenure and then of course was in the private sector and then have come back now and the agency is very different now than it was when I left and also when I started originally. So it is a special agency. It is a place that is near and dear to my heart since my entire career started there. And this is my fourth time being back at the agency. I mean, it&rsquo;s like a baby bird that left the nest and came back, right? So it&rsquo;s so important to me. It&rsquo;s such a huge part of my life and who I am today.</p>
<p>I had three years to observe, study, see where things that could have been improved. And also I had the benefit of looking at how the SEC had gone through its transformation and its restructuring after the financial crisis that was in the Dodd-Frank Act. And I also was at the SEC when some things like their enforcement division was getting restructured. So I came up with the transformation plan. There&rsquo;s five pillars, governance, culture, talent, operations and excellence. And so we&rsquo;ve done things like updated the performance plan for the first time in eight years, created KPIs that actually measure something. I&rsquo;ve saved $50 million on an annualized basis, which is 12% of our $365 million budget with what we saved. I was able to provide performance bonuses for the first time ever in the CFTC&rsquo;s history of 1000 to $10,000. And we gave those to 17% of our staff who had just demonstrated exceptional achievements.</p>
<p>So performance bonuses, these are things that work in the private sector and they will work in the public sector as well if we implement them and put them into place. Doing things like identifying like functions that have been scattered into different divisions and combining them into one place to eliminate redundancies. I mean, these are very common sense things. I don&rsquo;t think anybody would look at anything that I&rsquo;ve done and been like, oh no, that&rsquo;s unusual. And just having that rigor when you&rsquo;re a public company and you have to report your quarterly earnings and you have stocks audits, and you&rsquo;re accountable to your shareholders, there&rsquo;s a rigor there. And why should a public institution, like a government agency be any less accountable to their stakeholders than a public company? That&rsquo;s fundamentally the viewpoint that I bring to it. So the next piece of what we&rsquo;re doing and what I&rsquo;ve been asked to do is to now build the agency back and to build it back to be able to take on its new mission expanded jurisdiction.</p>
<p>So we are working on hiring now, and I am looking at standing up now senior leadership and executive management team to now lead all of the new division. So I am looking for things, like I need a head of markets. I need a head of research. I need a head of market surveillance. I need a head of, somebody with a background, like a head of compliance examinations. We need to have people at the CFTC who are from the markets, because the CFTC&rsquo;s mission is to ensure well-functioning markets, to ensure market integrity.</p>
<p>And when we think about the heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical risk, the environment that we are in, it&rsquo;s never been more important that at the CFTC, given that we oversee the 700 trillion notional derivatives markets, we oversee the most systemically important clearing houses in the world, we need to be on top of our game. I implemented NASDAQ market surveillance, so we finally updated our 90s era legacy surveillance system. So industry leaders with 30 to 40 years of experience who would like to serve their country, who would like to have a hand in shaping this exciting moment that we have, an inflection point for markets, please come and find me. Please come talk to me. We need top talent at the CFTC, and it&rsquo;s very rewarding. Thank you.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;Chairman Pham, thank you so much for being with us today, and thank you for your service.</p>
<p><span>Pham:</span>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p><span>Bentsen:</span>&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Strong product velocity fuels record results as Robinhood makes progress across focus areas</p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><strong>Financial Outlook</strong></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The paragraph below provides information on our 2025 expense plan and outlook. We are not providing a 2025 outlook for total operating expenses and have not reconciled our 2025 outlook for Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, total operating expenses, because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of certain items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, provision for credit losses and significant regulatory expenses which may be material and could have a significant impact on total operating expenses for 2025.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Our 2025 expense plan includes growth investments in new products, features, and international expansion while also getting more efficient in our existing businesses. Our prior outlook for combined Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC for full-year 2025 provided at Q2 2025 Earnings (July 30, 2025) was&nbsp;$2.15 billion&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2.25 billion. Our strong year-to-date business and revenue growth had put us on track to be around the top end of that outlook range. This included an increased employee bonus accrual, as we are currently exceeding the performance targets we set at the beginning of the year. Additionally, our stock price appreciation triggered the vesting of the 2019 CEO Market-Based RSUs, resulting in payroll taxes reflected in general and administrative expenses primarily in Q3 that were not included in our prior outlook. And we are also increasing our investments in new growth areas like&nbsp;Prediction Markets and Robinhood Ventures&nbsp;that we believe have significant potential. Taken together, we now expect our 2025 full year Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC to be approximately&nbsp;$2.28 billion, which could be higher or lower depending on how the rest of the year plays out. This expense outlook does not include provision for credit losses, costs related to our pending acquisition of WonderFi, potential significant regulatory matters, or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and other business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Actual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>

Notably, we achieved record average daily volume of 9.6 million contracts across our options exchanges for the third quarter, increasing 56% over the same period in the prior year."</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, we remain committed to leveraging our ongoing investments in technology, relationships and industry expertise as we seek to further expand market share in our options business and grow our equities, futures, and international segments.

<p><b><i>Options</i></b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Net revenue grew 55% to $94.5 million, compared to $60.9 million in the prior-year period. The growth was primarily driven by higher net transaction fees that benefitted from increased industry volume, higher market share, and higher revenue per contract (RPC). Higher non-transaction fees were primarily driven by the launch of the MIAX Sapphire electronic options exchange in August 2024 which also contributed to increased revenues.</li>
<li>Operating income increased 56% to $51.4 million, compared to $32.9 million in the prior-year period. The growth was primarily due to higher net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses driven by share-based compensation costs.</li>
<li>Adjusted EBITDA grew 70% to $69.1 million, compared to $40.7 million in the prior-year period.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Equities</i></b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Net revenue nearly doubled to $4.4 million, compared to $2.2 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher net transaction fees from improved but still negative pricing as liquidity payments exceeded transaction revenues.</li>
<li>Operating loss of $4.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.0 million in the prior-year period.</li>
<li>Adjusted EBITDA of $(0.9) million, compared to $(2.5) million in the prior-year period.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Futures</i></b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Net revenue was $4.8 million, compared to $5.3 million in the prior-year period. The decrease was due to participant migrations to the MIAX Futures Onyx trading platform and lower commodity market volatility, partially offset by the elimination of expenses related to CME Globex.</li>
<li>Operating loss was $18.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $12.8 million in the prior-year period. The change was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses driven by share-based compensation costs.</li>
<li>Adjusted EBITDA of $(9.6) million, compared to $(8.0) million in the prior-year period.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>International</i>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Net revenue was $5.5 million, compared to $0.8 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of The International Stock Exchange Group Limited (TISE) in June 2025.</li>
<li>Operating income was $0.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.6 million in the prior-year period. The change was primarily due to the impact of the TISE acquisition.</li>
<li>Adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million, compared to $(1.7) million in the prior-year period.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Capital and Liquidity</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>On August 13, 2025, MIH raised $396.8 million in gross proceeds from its IPO of 17,250,000 shares of common stock, including the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares.</li>
<li>On August 18, 2025, MIH repaid its outstanding senior secured loan agreement maturing in 2029. The amount repaid by MIH included $178.4 million of outstanding indebtedness, accrued and unpaid interest, the related premium, and fees.</li>
<li>As of September 30, 2025, MIH had cash and cash equivalents of $401.5 million and total debt of $6.5 million.</li>

<p><b>Non-GAAP Financial Information</b></p>
<p>Adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to MIH adjusted for share-based compensation, investment gain/loss, litigation costs, change in fair value of puttable warrants issued with debt, change in fair value of puttable common stock, loss on extinguishment of debt, one time IPO payments, settlement fee, impairment charges, warrant modifications, and unrealized gain/loss on derivative assets, net of the income tax effects of these adjustments. A reconciliation of net income attributable to MIH to adjusted earnings, appears below.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to MIH adjusted for interest expense and amortization of debt discount costs, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, investment gain/loss, litigation costs, change in fair value of puttable warrants issued with debt, change in fair value of puttable common stock, loss on extinguishment of debt, one time IPO payments, settlement fee, impairment charges, gain/loss on intangible asset, warrant modifications, and unrealized gain/loss on derivative assets. A reconciliation of net income attributable to MIH to adjusted EBITDA, appears below.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted revenues less cost of revenues.</p>
<p>Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as adjusted earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding used for adjusted diluted earnings per share (which includes the impact of anti-dilutive securities on a GAAP basis).</p>

<title>SIFMA Submits Recommendations To Treasury On Stablecoins Under The GENIUS Act</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-submits-recommendations-to-treasury-on-stablecoins-under-the-genius-act-2025115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-submits-recommendations-to-treasury-on-stablecoins-under-the-genius-act-2025115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA and SIFMA AMG today submitted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/advance-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking-on-genius-act-implementation-sifma-and-sifma-amg/">letter</a>&nbsp;in response to The Department of the Treasury advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting comment on questions relating to the implementation of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.</p>
<p>SIFMA supports the GENIUS Act&rsquo;s creation of a new regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, which it sees as a critical step in the development of mature digital asset markets, including markets for tokenized securities and other tokenized assets. It is critical that the GENIUS Act be implemented in a manner that protects consumers and investors; mitigates potential risks to the markets and broader financial system; minimizes opportunities for regulatory arbitrage; and promotes responsible innovation, ensuring continued U.S. leadership in the digital assets ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury&rsquo;s approach to stablecoin regulation will shape the foundation of the future digital financial system,&rdquo; said SIFMA president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our recommendations seek to balance innovation and financial stability by providing clear definitions, consistent oversight, and strong safeguards for investors, consumers, and markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SIFMA&rsquo;s recommendations include the following key principles:</p>
<p><span>Clear Scope, Safe Harbors, and Transition Mechanisms</span>: Treasury should provide early regulatory clarity on the reach of Section 3 and establish limited safe harbors for offshore issuances, non-USD stablecoins used for legitimate cross-border or settlement purposes, and de minimis test transactions. Guidance should also define when an entity is &ldquo;issuing in the United States&rdquo; or &ldquo;offering to a U.S. person,&rdquo; with reasonable transition periods before enforcement.</p>
<p><span>Functional, Proportionate Definitions</span>: Definitions of &ldquo;payment stablecoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;digital asset,&rdquo; and &ldquo;digital asset service provider&rdquo; should be activity-based and technology-neutral. Exemptions for software developers, protocols, and self-custody should be narrowly applied to preserve true peer-to-peer and open-source innovation while capturing entities that exercise control or earn fees.</p>
<p><span>Reserve and Custody Standards</span>: SIFMA supports strong reserve and transparency standards for permitted payment stablecoin issuers (PPSIs), while allowing flexibility to hold diversified high-quality liquid assets such as Treasury money-market funds, Treasury-backed repos, and deposits at U.S. branches of foreign banks. Reserve assets should be subject to established custody and audit controls consistent with SEC frameworks.</p>
<p><span>Accounting and Collateral Treatment</span>: Treasury should work with the Financial Accounting Standards Board to classify permitted payment stablecoins as cash equivalents and work with other regulators to ensure they are considered eligible collateral for margin purposes. Equivalent treatment should extend to tokenized money-market funds and tokenized Treasury instruments.</p>
<p><span>Restrictions on Non-Financial Issuers</span>: SIFMA supports strict limits on non-financial firms issuing payment stablecoins and recommends that the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee assess systemic, governance, and contagion risks before granting exemptions.</p>
<p><span>Federal-State and Cross-Border Consistency</span>: SIFMA supports a dual federal-state pathway for PPSIs based on the principle of &ldquo;same risk, same activity, same regulatory outcome.&rdquo; Treasury should interpret comparability standards through a principles-based lens emphasizing prudential safeguards, consumer protection, and AML/CFT compliance, while applying the $10 billion oversight threshold on a consolidated, group-wide basis.</p>
<p><span>International Alignment</span>: SIFMA urges Treasury to apply outcomes-based comparability when assessing foreign regimes under Section 18, focusing on comparable prudential and supervisory outcomes rather than legal form. SIFMA also recommends reciprocity and interoperability standards that prevent anti-competitive practices and reinforce the dollar&rsquo;s central role in global markets.</p>
<p><span>Tax Clarity</span>: Treasury and the IRS should confirm that transactions in permitted payment stablecoins are treated as cash equivalents, not property transactions, eliminating unnecessary gain/loss recognition and facilitating widespread use in payments and settlement.</p>
<p><span>Implementation Priorities</span>: Treasury should coordinate with banking regulators to define permissible bank activities in digital-asset markets and provide clear parameters for staking by regulated financial institutions&mdash;both critical for the secure growth of tokenized financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>The full letter is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/letters/advance-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking-on-genius-act-implementation-sifma-and-sifma-amg/">here</a>.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Encourages Open Dialogue Amid Trend Toward Hybrid And Self-Directed Investing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Montreal - In recognition of Financial Literacy Month&rsquo;s theme&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/campaigns/financial-literacy-month.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;Talk Money&rdquo;</a>, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) urges Canadians to speak with family members, friends and, when possible, advisors about their financial plans and to do more research. Having open conversations about money and accessing credible resources can increase investors&rsquo; financial literacy, help enable them to make good decisions for their financial future, and help them protect themselves and their loved ones from fraud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New CSA research on hybrid investors</a>&nbsp;indicates that those who were less likely to talk with an advisor about their investments when developing a financial plan were more inclined to engage in higher-risk, speculative behaviour, like frequent trading and investing in high-risk alternative investments, including crypto assets and options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Canadians take a more active role in managing their investments, it is essential they use available tools, knowledge and resources to help them make informed decisions,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Financial Literacy Month is an opportunity to empower investors with the knowledge to participate in Canada&rsquo;s capital markets, and that starts with candid conversations around their risk tolerance, financial goals and their sources of information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether working with a financial advisor, investing independently or a blend of both, the CSA encourages Canadians to consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check before investing</strong>. Before investing, investors should check if the online platform or financial institution they are interested in working with is registered by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/are-they-registered/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aretheyregistered.ca</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use research and tools effectively</strong>. Securities regulators have a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variety of investor tools</a>&nbsp;that can guide investors through investing basics, like questions you should ask before working with an advisor and how to understand the different types of investments.</li>
<li><strong>Understand your risk tolerance</strong>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/investing-basics/#risk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Knowing how much risk you&rsquo;re willing to take</a>&nbsp;is essential to building a sound investment strategy. Every investment carries some level of risk&mdash;higher potential returns typically come with higher risk. There is no such thing as a high-return, risk-free investment. Carefully evaluate each opportunity and ensure you fully understand the investment, the associated risks and how it fits within your financial plan.</li>
<li><strong>Recognize red flags of fraud</strong>. Look for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/avoiding-fraud/know-the-red-flags-of-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">any of these red flags when investing</a>. If you spot a red flag, exercise caution before making a decision. The investment may be a scam, or the person or firm offering it may not be registered to do so. Immediately report suspicious activity to your local securities regulator.</li>
<li><strong>Seek qualified professionals when possible</strong>. If you want assistance with building a comprehensive financial plan or reviewing your existing plan, speaking with a registered financial advisor or a certified financial planner can help you plan effectively and invest suitably.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p>For investor inquiries, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact your local securities regulator</a>.</p>

<p>
<div dir="ltr">Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) closed October 2025 on a bullish note, gaining 8 per cent and extending the upward momentum that has defined much of the year&rsquo;s trading.<br /><br />The NGX All-Share Index rose from 142,713.1 points at the start of the month to 154,126.4 points at the close, with more than 12 billion shares exchanged. The advance reflects growing investor confidence in Nigeria&rsquo;s corporate earnings outlook, alongside sustained fiscal and monetary policy reforms aimed at stabilising growth.<br /><br />October ranked as the second-best performing month of the year, behind July&rsquo;s 16.57 per cent surge. The market has returned 49.74 per cent year-to-date, with the second half alone contributing 28.46 per cent. Except for a modest 1.99 per cent pullback in March, every other month in 2025 has ended in positive territory, demonstrating the market&rsquo;s resilience amid shifting global and domestic dynamics.<br /><br />Analysts attribute the rally to upbeat third-quarter earnings, renewed foreign portfolio inflows, and policy reforms that have strengthened liquidity and investor sentiment.<br /><br />Commenting on the performance, Temi Popoola, GMD/CEO of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), stated, &ldquo;The consistent market performance we are witnessing reflects a renewed sense of confidence in Nigeria&rsquo;s economic direction. The combination of strong corporate earnings, improving liquidity conditions, and credible policy actions has provided a more predictable environment for investors. At NGX Group, we remain focused on deepening the ecosystem&rsquo;s resilience and positioning our market as a platform for sustainable long-term growth.&rdquo;<br /><br />The market's advance was broad-based, with most sectors closing in positive territory. The Industrial Goods sector was the standout performer, soaring 17.5% to 5,955.8 points. Heavyweights like Dangote Cement (+25.69%), BUA Cement (+12.5%), and Lafarge Africa (+11.91%) led the charge.<br /><br />The Oil &amp; Gas index recorded its strongest monthly gain of the year, rising 15.45%. The rally was fueled by firm crude oil prices and robust company earnings, with Aradel Holdings (+27.15%) and Seplat Energy (+10%) as key drivers. Meanwhile, the Consumer Goods sector extended its winning streak to a seventh consecutive month, advancing 4.85%. BUA Foods, the bourse's largest listed company, rose 9.97%, while PZ Cussons Nigeria (+20.29%) and Vitafoam Nigeria (+17.79%) also posted significant gains.<br /><br />The Insurance index climbed 3.37%, supported by strong performances from Sovereign Trust Insurance (+30%) and AIICO Insurance (+11.71%). In a contrasting move, the Banking Index was the sole laggard, dipping 3.15% as sell-offs in major tier-one lenders outweighed gains from others like Wema Bank (+20.29%).<br /><br />As the market looks ahead, Jude Chiemeka, CEO of Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), noted, &ldquo;The October rally highlights the depth of investor engagement across sectors. Our priority remains to enhance market efficiency and ensure the Exchange remains a credible reflection of Nigeria&rsquo;s economic resilience.&rdquo;<br /><br />With two months left in the year, market watchers are now focusing on corporate guidance and macroeconomic stability to gauge if the positive momentum can be sustained into 2026.</div>

<title>The EBA Publishes Its Final Guidelines On Environmental Scenario Analysis</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-its-final-guidelines-on-environmental-scenario-analysis-2025115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Guidelines on environmental scenario analysis,&nbsp;which complement the EBA Guidelines on the management of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks by specifying supervisory expectations regarding how institutions should conduct environmental scenario analysis.</span></p>
<p>The Guidelines aim to strengthen institutions&rsquo; ability to use forward-looking approaches to the assessment and management of environmental risks.</p>
<p>The Guidelines are built around two complementary pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>integration of environmental risks into institutions&rsquo; existing stress-testing frameworks, enabling banks to assess the short-term financial impacts of environmental risks and ensure that capital and liquidity levels remain adequate; and</li>
<li>resilience analysis, looking further ahead to evaluate the medium- to long-term implications of environmental risks and opportunities for banks&rsquo; business models, strategies, and risk profiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these two elements will help institutions to embed environmental risk considerations more effectively into their overall risk management and strategic planning processes. They also provide a common reference point to support consistent, forward-looking management of environmental risks across the EU banking sector.</p>
<p>The Guidelines will apply from 1 January 2027.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The Guidelines, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/sustainable-finance/guidelines-management-esg-risks" title="Guidelines on the management of ESG risks">Guidelines on the management of ESG risks</a>, are based on Article 87(a)5 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6). They also fulfil Article 177 (2a) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3).</p>
<p>The Guidelines on environmental scenario analysis form part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2022/ESG%20roadmap/1045378/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20Sustainable%20Finance.pdf">EBA&rsquo;s roadmap on sustainable finance</a>&nbsp;for the integration of ESG risks into the prudential framework and fit within the broader&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf">roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package,</a></p>

<p class="fusionResponsiveColumn"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://click-783105.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=647123&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4521996&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.exegy.com%2F&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=527f43e1b5610330d904e4ea41b6ea943cc4e23146431d00e8c58ff6417a967c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Exegy</a></span>, a leading provider of market data, trading technology, and managed services for the capital markets, today announced the expansion of its Axiom market data platform to include real-time, low-latency Canadian equity data via the TMX Information Processor (TMX IP), a TMX Datalinx product. This enables global clients to access key Canadian feeds, including CBBO, CDF, and CLS, through their existing cross-connects to Exegy&rsquo;s New York point of presence, eliminating the need for additional infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="fusionResponsiveColumn"><span>Axiom is Exegy&rsquo;s market data-as-a-service solution, providing reliable access to real-time market data from more than 300 venues worldwide. The addition of Canadian equities support is driven by strong client demand and reflects Exegy&rsquo;s ongoing investment in reducing cost and operational complexity for global trading firms.</span></p>
<p class="fusionResponsiveColumn"><span>Arnaud Derasse, CTO of Exegy, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;By integrating TMX IP into our Axiom platform, we&rsquo;re removing the barriers to accessing Canadian equities market data. Our clients can now expand their coverage effortlessly, with zero technical lift. With a simple subscription, they can instantly tap into Canadian feeds using infrastructure they already rely on &ndash; making this a cost-effective and simple solution.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="fusionResponsiveColumn"><span>The TMX IP integration offers clients flexibility to tailor their subscriptions, with access to one, two, or all three of the following feeds:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><b>CBBO</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Canadian Best Bid and Offer</span></li>
<li><span><b>CDF</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Consolidated Data Feed</span></li>
<li><span><b>CLS</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Consolidated Last Sale</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="fusionResponsiveColumn"><span>This seamless access eliminates the need for separate, dedicated Canadian infrastructure or co-location &ndash; streamlining operations, reducing datacenter footprint, and accelerating time-to-market.</span></p>
<p class="fusionResponsiveColumn"><span>This expansion follows the June 2025 launch of Exegy Nexus, the breakthrough FPGA-powered market data platform that delivers over 40% in cost savings.&nbsp;Together, Axiom and Nexus underscore Exegy&rsquo;s commitment to bringing efficient, scalable, and future-ready technology to the world&rsquo;s capital markets.</span></p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury: Quarterly Refunding Statement Of Deputy Assistant Secretary For Federal Finance Brian Smith</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering $125 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $98.2 billion of privately-held Treasury notes maturing on November 15, 2025.&nbsp; This issuance will raise new cash from private investors of approximately $26.8 billion.&nbsp; The securities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 3-year note in the amount of $58 billion, maturing November 15, 2028;</li>
<li>A 10-year note in the amount of $42 billion, maturing November 15, 2035; and</li>
<li>A 30-year bond in the amount of $25 billion, maturing November 15, 2055.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 3-year note will be auctioned at 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday, November 10, 2025.&nbsp; The 10-year note will be auctioned at 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, November 12, 2025.&nbsp; The 30-year bond will be auctioned at 1:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, November 13, 2025.&nbsp;All these auctions will take place on a yield basis and will settle on Monday, November 17, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balance of Treasury financing requirements over the quarter will be met with regular weekly bill auctions, cash management bills (CMBs), and monthly note, bond, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and 2-year Floating Rate Note (FRN) auctions.</p>
<h3>NOMINAL COUPON AND FRN FINANCING</h3>
<p>Treasury believes its current auction sizes leave it well positioned to address potential changes to the fiscal outlook and to the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio. &nbsp;Based on current projected borrowing needs, Treasury anticipates maintaining nominal coupon and FRN auction sizes for at least the next several quarters.&nbsp; Looking ahead, Treasury has begun to preliminarily consider future increases to nominal coupon and FRN auction sizes, with a focus on evaluating trends in structural demand and assessing potential costs and risks of various issuance profiles.</p>
<p>The table below presents, in billions of dollars, the actual auction sizes for the August to October 2025 quarter and the anticipated auction sizes for the November 2025 to January 2026 quarter:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Treasury plans to address any seasonal or unexpected variations in borrowing needs over the next quarter through changes in regular bill auction sizes and/or CMBs.</p>
<h3>TIPS FINANCING</h3>
<p>Over the November 2025 to January 2026 quarter, Treasury plans to maintain the November 10-year TIPS reopening auction size at $19 billion, increase the December 5-year TIPS reopening auction size by $1 billion to $24 billion, and maintain the January 10-year TIPS new issue auction size at $21 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BILL ISSUANCE&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Based on current fiscal forecasts, Treasury expects to maintain the offering sizes of benchmark bills into late-November.&nbsp;Given projections for receipts associated with the mid-month corporate and non-withheld tax date, Treasury expects to implement modest reductions to short-dated bill auction sizes during the month of December.&nbsp; Thereafter, by the middle of January 2026, Treasury anticipates increasing bill auction sizes based on expected fiscal outflows.</p>
<p>As always, Treasury will continue to evaluate near-term borrowing needs and assess additional adjustments to bill auction sizes as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BUYBACKS</h3>
<p>Today, Treasury is releasing a tentative buyback&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Buyback-ScheduleQ42025.pdf">schedule</a>&nbsp;for the upcoming refunding quarter.&nbsp; In both the 10- to 20-year and 20- to 30-year nominal coupon buckets, Treasury plans to conduct four operations over the refunding quarter, each for up to $2 billion. &nbsp;In the other nominal coupon buckets, Treasury plans to conduct one liquidity support buyback of up to $4 billion.&nbsp; Treasury also plans to conduct two operations in the 1- to 10-year TIPS bucket, each for up to $750 million, and one operation for up to $500 million in the 10- to 30-year TIPS bucket.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasury paused cash management buybacks in September and, as indicated in the tentative buyback schedule, anticipates resuming cash management buybacks in December 2025.&nbsp; Amounts purchased in cash management buybacks temper reductions to bill auction sizes that would otherwise occur over the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Treasury anticipates that over the course of the upcoming quarter it will purchase up to $38 billion in off-the-run securities across buckets for liquidity support and up to $25 billion in the 1-month to 2-year bucket for cash management purposes.</p>
<p>As announced at the last quarterly refunding, in the first half of 2026 Treasury plans to offer direct buyback access to a limited number of additional counterparties&nbsp;based on their participation in Treasury auctions. &nbsp;For information on the eligibility criteria, please refer to the &ldquo;Who may participate in a buyback operation?&rdquo; section of Treasury&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/help-center/faqs/buyback-faqs/">buyback FAQs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SMALL-VALUE CONTINGENCY AUCTION OPERATION</h3>
<p>Treasury believes that it is prudent to regularly test its contingency auction infrastructure. &nbsp;Treasury&rsquo;s contingency auction system has been used routinely over the last several years to conduct both mock auctions and live small-value test auctions.&nbsp; Sometime over the next three months, Treasury intends to conduct a small-value test auction using its contingency auction system.&nbsp;Details about this test will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>This small-value test auction should not be viewed by market participants as a precursor or signal of any pending policy changes regarding Treasury&rsquo;s existing auction processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please send comments or suggestions on these subjects or other subjects related to debt management to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:debt.management@treasury.gov">debt.management@treasury.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The next quarterly refunding announcement will take place on Wednesday, February 4, 2026.</p>

<p><span>Speaker</span>: Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive<br /><span>Event</span>: Launch of the Chief Risk Officer Network<br /><span>Delivered</span>: 4 November 2025</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>We want to support responsible, managed risk to drive growth and innovation, enabled by outcomes-based regulation.</li>
<li>We need your help to help us bust myths that hinder progress.</li>
<li>The FCA is taking practical steps to rebalance risk in the system, recognising that the opportunity cost of inaction can be greater than the risks of change.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Lord Mayor, thank you for inviting me here today &ndash; I'm delighted to help to launch this important network.</p>
<p>You will know that the aim of this network is to help you, Chief Risk Officers (CROs), encourage responsible risk taking within your firms.</p>
<p>And no, I don&rsquo;t mean a new logo or whether to use Dominic West or Dominic Cooper in your latest adverts. I mean the type of risk that supports the growth of your firm, the financial services sector and the wider economy.</p>
<p>The type of growth that will enhance the UK&rsquo;s position as a leading global finance centre, where customers are well served and firms can operate with clarity and certainty.</p>
<p>We know that you and your firms want to take risks, not just manage them &ndash; 97% of you think the sector needs to be more comfortable taking managed risks to support growth.</p>
<p>And we get that; we have been talking about the need for a sensible debate on risk for months. We aren&rsquo;t just talking, though &ndash; we are acting.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-5-year-vision" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>5-year vision</h2>
<p>In March, we launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-work" title="How we work">new 5-year strategy</a>. We want to deepen trust, rebalance risk, support growth and improve lives.</p>
<p>It has 4 key priorities: we want to be a smarter regulator, support growth, fight financial crime and help consumers navigate their financial lives. That&rsquo;s down from the 13 we had in our previous strategy &ndash; a prime example of how we&rsquo;re reducing red tape.</p>
<p>The strategy puts growth at the heart of what we do. It's mentioned 30 times in a 22-page document. Innovation, a driver of growth, is mentioned 15 times. That's deliberate.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s at the heart of our new strategy, growth has always been part of our work as a regulator. Our job &ndash; in legislation &ndash; is to make sure that markets work well. A fair and thriving financial services sector that delivers for the good of consumers and the economy does just that.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-help-wanted" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Help wanted</h2>
<p>The strategy does, though, set a new direction for the FCA. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are firmly committed to outcomes-focused regulation. This is deliberate &ndash; the UK will be better placed to support innovation and developments in markets with an outcomes-focused rule set. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our existing outcomes-focused rule set is the reason that we are not regulating separately for AI. We do not believe that this is necessary or sensible &ndash; given how quickly prescriptive rules could be out of date.</p>
<p>This shift to outcomes-focused and less prescriptive rules may feel uncomfortable for some of you in this room. It requires a culture change &ndash; both in the industry and, yes, for us a regulator. And it requires more active risk management within firms.</p>
<p>But an outcomes-focused approach is essential if we are to be forward looking and supportive of innovation.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard me say that we are in a problem solving, myth busting and risk adjusting mindset. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By problem solving I mean that we want to work with others where there are broader issues that need to be solved. Take our previous work with the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s office on how firms can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-and-ico-confirm-how-firms-can-support-savings-customers" title="FCA and ICO confirm how firms can support savings customers">communicate with customers to inform them of savings rates</a>, and work that explains how firms can give guidance on retail investments as examples.</p>
<p>By myth busting I mean that we want to hear from you where you believe there are regulatory barriers getting in the way of you delivering the outcomes that we are seeking. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To do that, we do need your help. You have a unique view of where there may be regulatory barriers - or dare I say - where your firms may be overcomplicating matters. Or where industry, as a whole, have established norms through custom and practice that are getting in the way.</p>
<p>I sometimes say that if everyone in a firm plays it 10% safe &ndash; at the front line, risk, compliance and legal &ndash; and then a regulator is added to the mix - you can easily find yourself 50% away from a rule set.</p>
<p>Let me give you 2 examples of what I mean. Where myths about what our rules say have arisen and have led to practices which are causing frustration. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have hopefully heard, we have recently launched once-in-a-generation changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/advice-guidance-boundary-review" title="Advice Guidance Boundary Review">our advice rules</a>.</p>
<p>If you have not heard about this, please let me know, and I will come speak to you at length about it after this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Called targeted support, these rules will help more people navigate their financial lives and give them confidence to invest.</p>
<p>Because this is so new, and we need it to work, we have worked differently when it comes to writing rules. We hosted a policy 'sprint' and collaborated with firms to test consumer journeys and get a real, practical sense of where rules are needed and where they&rsquo;re not. Even before we had written a single rule. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During the sprint, firms had an important question: 'Why do we need to disclose risks before benefits, and why do we need to use clunky wording to disclose these risks?' &nbsp;</p>
<p>Me, being curious and having seen how some of our more prescriptive rules are drafted, asked my teams the same.</p>
<p>It turns out that these warnings are not set by our rules &ndash; they&rsquo;re simply custom and practice within industry. Given this, we could have just left it. Instead, we&rsquo;re working with the Investment Association on mainstream investments to drive industry-wide consistency. And to bust those myths.</p>
<p>And if you take one, simple, clearly worded message away from tonight, let it be this:&nbsp;<span>you can stop using clunky risk warnings.</span></p>
<p>We have also heard that listed companies are being forced into paying non-executive directors in cash rather than stock. We&rsquo;ve heard concerns that this can stop listed firms attracting the best talent and that this leads to less alignment of interests between firms and their NEDs.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a practice driven by our rules. Yes, there is Financial Reporting Council (FRC) guidance, but it does not prevent this happening. Rather, it seems to be custom and practice, with the rallying cry of 'it&rsquo;s always been done this way'.</p>
<p>Again, we have sought to bust this myth. This can be done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As CROs, you may have other examples of regulatory barriers (real or not) which seemingly get in the way of the strategic objectives we are aiming for. If so, tell us. We can then get to the bottom of those myths, and work to bust them.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-balance-of-rebalancing" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The balance of rebalancing</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just busting myths. We&rsquo;re taking practical steps to deliver and rebalance the existing risk in the system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned our work on the advice guidance boundary &ndash; again, grab me afterwards if you want to know more.</p>
<p>We have acknowledged that these changes involved different risks.</p>
<p>Some people may get a worse outcome, but the risk of not acting is higher. This is rebalancing risk in action.</p>
<p>This is true of our recent mortgage work, too. Changes to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-helps-people-navigate-financial-lives-simplified-mortgage-rules" title="FCA helps people navigate their financial lives with simplified mortgage rules">mortgage affordability rules</a>&nbsp;aim to support growth and help more people to benefit from choice in the mortgage market. That does come with some risk, but also the security of home ownership for more people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the wholesale space, we have introduced a world first, and new type of private stock market, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/pisces-private-intermittent-securities-capital-exchange-system" title="PISCES: platforms for trading private company shares">Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System</a>, which will unlock capital. It supports growth by enabling companies to raise capital while staying private. And it will open the door to more opportunities for investors and facilitate their access to growth companies.</p>
<p>When finalising the rules, we thought hard about whether this should be subject to private market or public market safeguards. We settled on this being private market plus - we&rsquo;ve disapplied insider dealing rules and put more emphasis on investors to do their own due diligence. We have been public about this risk trade-off. Things may go wrong, but we believe it's the right risk to be taking now to support growth.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-smarter-regulator" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Smarter regulator</h2>
<p>I have talked a lot this evening about changes to our rules.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to touch briefly on how we are operating as a regulator, working smarter, more predictably, proportionately and purposefully. Taking on board feedback that we need to work more smartly as an organisation.</p>
<p>We have already made major strides in improving our authorisation response times, something which I know you and your predecessors have highlighted, Lord Mayor. We have recently pledged to speed up this process even more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also eased frictions by removing unnecessary data returns, ensuring we only ask for the data we need and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/fca-removes-data-returns-help-36000-firms" title="FCA removes more data returns, helping 36,000 firms">reducing the data burden on 95% of the firms we regulate</a>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now looking at supervision, marking a fundamental shift in how we supervise the firms we regulate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use technology to reduce time spent on processes and lower-value activity. This will free up our supervisors to concentrate on what really matters in the firms they supervise and where they can have the most impact. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a lighter touch, just a smarter one.</p>
<p>As well as thinking about how the rule set can be different, we are focused on how we can work differently, to support our strategy and our focus on enabling a fair and thriving financial services sector.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As Chief Risk Officers, your daily life is a balancing act &ndash; managing internal and external expectations, the desire for growth and the fear of failure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But you see the value in calculated, controlled risk. Not hiding behind rules but embracing the opportunities that come from outcomes-based regulation.</p>
<p>As I hope is clear, we stand by you in this. We know that more risk is needed in the system &ndash; that it&rsquo;s the key to driving the kind of growth we&rsquo;d like to see.</p>
<p>So, if you see sticking points, myths that need busting, or opportunities that are being missed, come and tell us. We want to hear from you.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to be speaking at this prestigious innovation summit, amongst many leaders and thinkers shaping the future of the insurance market. With the summit being held on Guy Fawkes night, I&rsquo;m sure there will be fireworks today, but I promise not to light any actual fuses during this speech &ndash; just a few rhetorical ones.</p>
<p>My colleagues David Bailey<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;and Vicky White<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;spoke about innovation and prudential regulation earlier in the year, so this isn&rsquo;t the first speech that the PRA has delivered on supporting innovation. In fact, I also spoke last year about what we are doing to enhance our Secondary Competitiveness and Growth Objective (SCGO) in the context of UK insurers<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>. In that speech I highlighted that one of the regulatory foundations that underpins the SGCO is the PRA &lsquo;taking a responsive approach to UK risks, opportunities and innovation&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t be going over that ground again, but I reference it to highlight that the SCGO provides a strong basis for us to support innovation in financial services. Today, I&rsquo;ll attempt to bring together a broad range of regulatory initiatives currently underway to support innovation across life insurers, general insurers and the London Market.</p>
<p>Everything that I say today should, however, be set within the context that the PRA must always act in pursuit of its primary objectives of safety and soundness and policyholder protection. But innovation is a means to that end - for example, where it protects firms by enabling their business models to adapt to the ever changing landscape. And our secondary objective of competitiveness and growth is proving a powerful tool for prioritising initiatives which make a meaningful contribution to the UK economy.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to talk to you about how we are endeavouring to support innovation in the&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk211523956"></a>UK insurance industry: firstly, through creating regulatory space for firms to innovate; secondly, through actively building a regulatory framework that facilitates innovation; and thirdly, through being innovative in our own supervisory approach.</p>
<h3>First: Creating space for the market to innovate</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with how we want to allow for appropriate regulatory space for industry to safely &ldquo;ignite&rdquo; new initiatives. Take, for example, the London Market, which has a strong tradition of innovation. Since its launch in 2018, the Lloyd&rsquo;s Lab has supported over 150 transformative Insurtech solutions, with &pound;2.5bn of underwriting capacity launched to test and scale new products. The credit for this lies with Lloyd&rsquo;s, but it demonstrates that the regulatory environment of the London Market is sufficiently receptive to this sort of innovation. Another example would be the London Market&rsquo;s pioneering of cyber insurance, a market now worth over &pound;1 billion in premiums<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>, again illustrating sufficient regulatory &lsquo;space&rsquo; for this market to grow to meet the demands of businesses seeking cyber loss protection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also focused on having effective regulatory processes at the PRA to ensure we make it as efficient as possible for firms to engage with us. This includes the PRA&rsquo;s speed of authorisation and reducing regulatory costs, such as minimising regulatory reporting and ensuring that any new data requests are necessary and proportionate. This frees up resources at firms that can be reinvested in innovation - whether that&rsquo;s new products, new platforms, or new ways of managing risk.</p>
<h3>Second: actively enabling innovation</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s now turn to how we at the PRA are actively facilitating innovation for insurers.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator (&ldquo;the Accelerator&rdquo;) which we launched last month<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>. Through this new initiative we&rsquo;re taking further action to reduce barriers facing life insurers to invest in UK productive assets<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>. As many of you will know, under Solvency UK, we implemented significant reforms in 2024 to improve the life insurance sector&rsquo;s ability to invest in the UK, which the industry pledged to take advantage of by making &pound;100bn of productive investment. The Accelerator, builds on those reforms, and will allow firms to make timely investments as soon as they identify them and gain the favourable matching adjustment capital treatment, based on their own assessment of eligibility. There will no longer be a need for life insurers to wait for PRA approval before investing in eligible assets. We&rsquo;ve already had a flurry of interest from annuity-writing firms and they will have the opportunity to use the Accelerator by year end, allowing them to get on with making a wide range of productive investments for the benefit of the UK economy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also actively looking to introduce reforms which will ensure that UK corporates have more risk management tools available to them, after hearing from them directly that a UK-based captives regime would allow them to better incubate and manage new risks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working closely with the Government and industry to build a captives regime in the UK that will be internationally competitive. We&rsquo;re currently assessing what a captives regime should look like, working with corporates, consultants, insurers and trade bodies to understand what they would want to see in a UK regime. Our vision is for a regime that: (1) is responsive in terms of authorisation, (2) has proportionate capital and oversight requirements, and (3) is flexible in terms of responding to different business needs and the classes of risk that could be ceded.</p>
<p>We recognise that captives can allow for risk management advances and assist in fuelling product development and innovation as risk incubators - where emerging risk is initially housed in a captive to build a data track record, before ultimately being ceded to the insurance market. In other words, when used properly, captives can allow corporates to safely innovate. We&rsquo;re working hard to deliver an internationally competitive captives regime - expect to see a PRA consultation next summer, with a target delivery date of mid-2027.</p>
<p>On ISPVs, we&rsquo;re continuing our work to ensure the UK regime is competitive. In its current form, the regime has delivered some notable successes: for example, London Bridge 2 has brought over $2bn of capital into the London Market. Again, we&rsquo;re not taking credit for others&rsquo; hard work, but we are making sure that we look to improve and enhance our ability to support such innovation. We know there&rsquo;s more to do and, in July, we implemented a series of significant enhancements to the UK ISPV regime, taking steps to streamline and simplify the approvals process (approving cat bond vehicles within 10 working days of a complete application), reducing the number of SMFs, and allowing ISPVs to issue multiple contracts.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Necessary legislative changes, currently under consultation by HMT, signal a broader ambition to ensure the UK remains a leading centre for risk transfer innovation.</p>
<p>As well as the traditional use of ISPVs in the property and casualty market, we&rsquo;re also looking at wider possibilities for their use. As my colleague Vicky White mentioned in her recent speech, the PRA will work with industry and HMT on identifying alternative capital options which will consider how the ISPV framework (or other structures) could be made more accessible to UK life insurers, and we expect to publish a discussion paper on this later this month.</p>
<p>With the introduction of captives, and the continued work to reform the ISPV regime, our ambition is clear: to play our part in helping the UK fulfil its important role as a global hub for insurance and risk management. By facilitating innovation, through making it easier for capital to come into the insurance market, firm resilience is improved, risk is better spread, and more coverage and new products are provided to those who need it across the real economy. Ultimately, this is good for both financial stability and policyholders.</p>
<h3>Third: innovating ourselves</h3>
<p>The final piece of the jigsaw is, of course, innovating ourselves. Enabling innovation in the market goes hand-in-hand with evolving our own supervisory approach. To bring this to life, I&rsquo;d like to offer a few examples of how we&rsquo;ve done this so far.</p>
<p>Internally, we&rsquo;re modernising how we operate. Initiatives such as our 2026 Dynamic General Insurance Stress Test will bring a new dimension to the stress-testing of the general insurance sector. We&rsquo;re also ensuring our authorisation processes make it as easy as possible for new firms to set up here, through our recent introduction of an early &lsquo;mobilisation&rsquo; option for new insurers and an accelerated pathway to authorise wholesale insurers. We&rsquo;re also actively supporting the new Office for Investment (colloquially referred to as the &lsquo;concierge service&rsquo;) to engage with prospective international insurers. And, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned in her speech of the 24 October, we&rsquo;re introducing with the FCA a new &lsquo;Scale-up&rsquo; unit to support banks and insurers to grow and innovate in the UK.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/november/shoib-khan-speech-at-marketforcelive-insurance-innovators-summit-2025#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re reducing the burden our processes place on established firms too. This includes, for example, streamlining the Lloyd&rsquo;s Managing Agents approval process and our supervisory approach for such firms to ensure that our processes are as proportionate and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>Within the PRA&rsquo;s oversight of the GI sector, we&rsquo;ve also partnered with third parties to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that improve our working practices - for example, helping us enhance our claims reserving analysis, which helps mitigate against insurers underestimating technical provisions which can distort firms&rsquo; resilience and market competition. It also enables us to identify outliers earlier, reverting to those firms more quickly, saving time for both us and the market. We&rsquo;re also experimenting with multi-agent AI systems to help us improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our own day to day supervision.</p>
<p>Externally, we&rsquo;re working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to share good practice on how AI is being used in the insurance sector, and to support the development of supervisory guidance that recognises both the risks and benefits of insurers adopting AI. We&rsquo;re also in bilateral discussions with other regulators about their use of AI.</p>
<p>All of this will help us become more data-driven, spot market trends more quickly and make better informed supervisory judgements.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Let me conclude by saying that we very much see our role as being supporters of innovation in the insurance sector. The investment accelerator is already live, and once our work on ISPVs is complete, we&rsquo;ll have added more optionality to the UK regulatory regime. From innovation in the Lloyd&rsquo;s Lab and London Bridge 2, the market is providing new products and solutions. The UK is becoming a more competitive jurisdiction for insurance-linked investment, thanks to our reforms aimed at making these vehicles more accessible, transparent, and resilient. And a captives regime will offer corporates in the real economy the opportunity to retain and manage new risk in an efficient manner that allows for innovation.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we want our commitment to innovation and competitiveness to be increasingly clear &ndash; not just in what we say, but in what we do. Of course, balance is key: and where innovation poses a risk to our objectives we will scrutinise that closely.</p>
<p>But, based on all the examples I&rsquo;ve given today, we feel we&rsquo;re doing our bit. The next step is for you &ndash; the market &ndash; to light the blue touch paper of innovation.</p>

<title>Tel Aviv Stock Exchange: Largest-Ever Equity Indices Update Kicks Off</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tel-aviv-stock-exchange-largest-ever-equity-indices-update-kicks-off-2025115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tel-aviv-stock-exchange-largest-ever-equity-indices-update-kicks-off-2025115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On Thursday, November 6, 2025, during the closing auction, TASE will execute its largest-ever equity indices update. The Index Update is driven by the continued significant growth in passive assets tracking the TASE indices. In the first 10 months of 2025 alone, these assets accumulated NIS 12 billion in new investments and saw an appreciation of NIS 20 billion across the indices, which boosted the total assets managed against TASE indices to an all-time record of NIS 82 billion.</p>
<p>As part of TASE&rsquo;s strategy of continuously developing new indices, it has recently launched number of new equity indices - TA-Defense, TA-Infrastructure, Banks and Insurance Equal Weight indices, and the TA-Real Estate 35 Index. TASE has successfully launched 11 new indices since the beginning of 2025 and intends to introduce additional new indices in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Yaniv Pagot, EVP, Head of Trading at TASE,&nbsp;</strong>said: &ldquo;TASE&rsquo;s Indices Unit has completed a review of the evolution of the entry requirements for the leading equity indices, particularly the minimum market capitalization threshold required for inclusion. The data confirms a significant leap in the valuation of the indices&rsquo; constituents. This development enhances liquidity, streamlines the composition of the indices and encourages healthy competition for inclusion, providing the companies with exposure to extensive passive investment flows.</p>
<p><strong>The new entry threshold for the indices in the November 2025 rebalance according to data from TASE&rsquo;s Trading Department:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TA-35 Index:&nbsp;</strong>The new entry threshold in the upcoming index update is NIS&nbsp;10.7 billion, compared to NIS 7.6 billion last May and NIS 4.8 billion in August 2020 - representing a more than two-fold increase over the past five years.</li>
<li><strong>TA-90 Index:&nbsp;</strong>The new entry threshold in the upcoming index update is NIS&nbsp;2.5 billion, compared to NIS 1.9 billion last May and only NIS 867 million in August 2020 - representing a three-fold increase over the past five years.</li>
<li><strong>TA-SME60 Index:&nbsp;</strong>The new entry threshold in the upcoming index update is NIS&nbsp;1.3 billion, compared to NIS 922 million last May and NIS 316 million in August 2020 - a quadruple surge over the past five years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AUM by index at the beginning of November 2025 according to data from TASE&rsquo;s Trading Department:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NIS 38 billion is managed against the TA-125 Index.</li>
<li>NIS 19 billion is managed against the TA-90 Index.</li>
<li>NIS 11 billion is managed against the TA-35 Index.</li>
<li>NIS 690 million is managed against the TA-SME60 Index (of which NIS 77 million was raised since the beginning of the year).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The median market capitalization of the index constituents according to data from TASE&rsquo;s Trading Department:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TA-35 Index - NIS 19 billion median (90% above the entry threshold).</li>
<li>TA-90 Index - NIS 4.1 billion median (65% above the entry threshold).</li>
<li>TA-SME60 Index - NIS 1.4 billion median (7% above the entry threshold).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yaniv Pagot, EVP, Head of Trading at TASE,&nbsp;</strong>added: &ldquo;The current index update represents a historic milestone for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, reflecting the dramatic increase in the value and quality of its listed companies. The significant growth in the local capital market since the beginning of 2025 is a testament to the increasing confidence of the retail and institutional investors in the Israeli economy and its capital market.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="BodytextboldWorldline">Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, and Deliverect, the leading global food tech SaaS company, are expanding their collaboration to bring smart self-ordering kiosks to more hospitality businesses across the UK.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Motor Finance Compensation Scheme Consultation Progress And Timing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-motor-finance-compensation-scheme-consultation-p-2025115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-motor-finance-compensation-scheme-consultation-p-2025115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&rsquo;ve moved at pace since the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0157" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Supreme Court judgment<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;in August 2025, which, along with a previous&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Clydesdale-v-Financial-Ombudsman-Service-and-others.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">High Court judgment<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, confirmed that motor finance lenders have liabilities to their customers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On 7 October 2025 we began consulting on an industry-wide compensation scheme as the most efficient way to address the liabilities for those motor finance customers treated unfairly between 2007 and 2024 and to provide certainty for all affected.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been undertaking extensive engagement with consumer groups, lenders, investors, motor manufacturers, trade bodies and professional representatives. We&rsquo;re grateful for the feedback already received and the speed with which many parties are working to engage constructively with us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as feedback on the methodology for calculating redress, issues raised so far include the time period for the scheme; the rate of compensatory interest; how independent mechanisms will ensure confidence (including the role of the Financial Ombudsman Service and ideas for alternative approaches); how smaller firms or those with a low number of agreements eligible for redress can operate the scheme in a cost-effective way; how to prevent fraud; and what the relationship between motor manufacturers and their captive lenders means for commercial ties, particularly in relation to lending for the purchase of new cars.</p>
<p>It's important we receive as much evidence as possible on specific concerns through the consultation as well as alternative suggestions if respondents don&rsquo;t agree with our proposals. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll consider all the evidence and ideas received before taking final decisions.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been transparent throughout. For example, 11 lenders, which were part of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-undertake-work-motor-finance-market" title="FCA to undertake work in the motor finance market">investigation into the historic use of discretionary commission arrangements</a>&nbsp;have had data since 16 August 2024 that showed their disclosure rates.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&rsquo;ve heard feedback - from lenders and some consumer and dealer representatives - that analysis of the extensive market wide data will take time, as will ensuring everything is in place so any scheme runs smoothly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re therefore extending the consultation deadline until 5pm on 12 December. We continue to welcome and encourage responses before then, including on those consultation questions that may take respondents less time to answer.</p>
<p>In parallel, we&rsquo;ll continue our extensive engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, including once the consultation has closed.</p>
<p>We still expect to publish final rules in early 2026. That will now be either February or March.</p>
<p>Some complaints have been paused since January 2024. We have been consulting on extending this pause beyond 4 December. That consultation is now closed and we&rsquo;re considering responses.</p>
<p>We are clear, however, that complaints cannot be paused indefinitely. It is therefore important, in particular for lenders, to maintain the pace so we can draw a line under this issue and bring certainty to their customers, the market and investors. This will ensure a trusted motor finance sector can continue to serve millions of families every year.</p>

<title>ACER: More Flexibility And Faster EU Electricity Market Integration Needed To Shield Consumers From Price Volatility And Support The Clean Energy Transition</title>

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAgcEAwIAUkwMAwdWHVYMAlQdCgFTUxoEBAZUVQMMUgBQUFAdBwAGUltXV1YdUVgFDh0GCFQDGg0EVwMZBQAHBQAEUlZVUgEDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER&rsquo;s 2025 electricity monitoring report</a>&nbsp;reviews progress in integrating EU electricity markets. It examines forward, day-ahead, intraday and balancing markets, and identifies where rules and projects are delayed.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s edition also highlights weather-driven price volatility, which occurs when unusually low renewable generation coincides with higher-than-normal demand due to exceptional weather conditions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What trends did ACER find in 2024?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EU market integration brings value&nbsp;</strong>and helps mitigate high electricity prices.</li>
<li>Price volatility shows that&nbsp;<strong>more flexibility is needed</strong>.</li>
<li>Long-term markets remain illiquid, limiting investment signals.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-border integration reduces costs</strong>, but project delays persist.</li>
<li><strong>Balancing integration generated</strong><strong>&nbsp;&euro;1.6 billion&nbsp;</strong>in welfare gains.</li>
<li><strong>Forward markets lack depth</strong>; Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are growing but vary widely in design.</li>
<li><strong>Day-ahead integration is consolidating and intraday markets are evolving</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s recommendations?</span></p>
<p>ACER points to several priorities that are key to resilience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reinforcing flexibility</strong>&nbsp;by investing in demand response, storage and backup generation.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerating delivery of delayed cross-border projects</strong>&nbsp;through timely completion of interconnectors and adoption of flow-based capacity allocation in intraday markets.</li>
<li><strong>Broadening transmission system operators' (TSOs') participation in balancing platforms</strong>&nbsp;to reduce costs and volatility and ensure more efficient system balancing.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthening forward markets&nbsp;</strong>with more active long-term trading and well-designed PPAs and Contracts for Difference (CfDs).</li>
<li><strong>Moving to flow-based allocation in the intraday timeframe&nbsp;</strong>to ensure efficient capacity use and reduce congestion-related costs.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancing monitoring and enforcement&nbsp;</strong>to ensure rules are applied consistently and consumers benefit.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.unitedfintech.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">United Fintech</a>, the digital transformation group for financial institutions, has acquired<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.tradeledger.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;Trade Ledger</a>, the pioneering technology company behind an AI-powered solution that automates commercial and business lending.</p>
<p>Trade Ledger brings to United Fintech a strong customer base that includes Barclays and Bank of Queensland, along with proven expertise in data-driven lending and commercial banking automation. The company will retain its leadership and brand identity while becoming an integral part of United Fintech&rsquo;s expanding Commercial Banking division.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AI is redefining how banks operate, and Trade Ledger is at the forefront of that change. Trade Ledger CEO and Co-Founder Martin McCann and his team have built exceptional technology that transforms lending into a real-time, data-driven experience for customers. Together with our acquisition of CBA earlier this year, we&rsquo;re now building the most complete digital infrastructure for commercial banking, from lending and trade finance to payments. Through the United Fintech ecosystem, we&rsquo;re scaling this innovation globally to give financial institutions the intelligent infrastructure they need to thrive in the AI era&rdquo;, said&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-frahm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Christian Frahm</a>, CEO and Founder of United Fintech.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For October 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Thai stock market extended gains for second consecutive month in October 2025, buoyed by multiple catalysts including expectations of government stimulus measures targeting domestic consumption and tourism, better-than-expected banking sector earnings, stronger-than-estimated export figures and tourist arrivals, and upward revisions to listed companies' net profit forecasts for 2025. Driven by these favorable conditions, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index rose 2.8 percent from the previous month to close at 1,309.50 points at the end of October. The upward momentum gained additional support in late October as U.S.-China trade tensions eased following the APEC meeting in South Korea and the Federal Reserve (Fed) decided to trim interest rates by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75-4.00 percent in a bid to buffer against economic risks. However, analysts maintained a cautious note on long-term global economic prospects, citing uncertainties around shifting trade and monetary policies, technology-related risks and inflated AI stock valuations, and elevated public debt levels.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> noted that government initiatives targeting at directly benefit citizens had delivered quick wins with measurable economic impact, effectively boosting broad-based incomes nationwide. In addition, last month&rsquo;s export and tourism performance exceeded analysts&rsquo; projections, prompting upward revisions to profit estimates for Thai listed companies across various industries. Historical trading patterns also suggest that net selling by Long-Term Equity Funds (LTF) unit holders typically eases during each year&rsquo;s final two months while tax-saving Thailand ESG Funds (ThaiESG) attract stronger inflows.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for October 2025</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of October 2025, the SET Index increased 2.8 percent MoM to close at 1,309.50 points, narrowing the YTD decrease to 6.5 percent. Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology and Financials.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 27.9 percent YoY to THB 39.47 billion (approx. USD 1.22 billion), with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 42.66 billion.</li>
<li>Foreign investors sold a net THB 4.50 billion, with THB 100.74 billion in net selling for the January-October period of 2025.</li>
<li>Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, accounting for 51.81 percent of total trading value, followed by local individuals at 31.80 percent, local institutional investors at 9.77 percent, and proprietary trading at 6.62 percent.</li>
<li>There were three newly listed companies on SET, namely Masstec Link pcl (MASTEC), Atlas Energy pcl (ATLAS), and Onsen Retreat and Spa Group pcl (ONSENS), and two newly listed companies on mai, namely Indigy pcl (IDG) and 88(Thailand) pcl (88TH).</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of October 2025 was 12.2 times, below the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 14.6 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 16.7 times, lower than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 17.0 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of October 2025 was 3.76 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 2.96 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of October 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 406,504 contracts, down 11.1 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 422,081 contracts, down 12.8 percent year-on-year mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

<p>&ldquo;HKEX continued to capture the momentum of global diversification and attractiveness of Chinese assets in Q3 2025, resulting in record results for the quarter and for the first nine months of 2025. At the end of Q3, we maintained our position at the top of global IPO tables, with a solid pipeline spanning the technology and other exciting sectors, whilst average daily volumes across our Cash Market, Derivatives Market and Stock Connect remained very robust. Meanwhile, steps taken by the London Metal Exchange to enhance liquidity on its markets, coupled with the ongoing dynamic macro backdrop, led to continued strength in metals trading activity.

<title>With AWS’s Support, JPXI Revs Up Efforts To Turn JPX Into A "Global, Comprehensive Finance And Information Platform"</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/with-awss-support-jpxi-revs-up-efforts-to-turn-jpx-into-a-global-comprehensi-2025115/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div>
<p class="component-text">With the support of Amazon Web Services (AWS), JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. (JPXI) is working to achieve the goal to turn Japan Exchange Group, Inc. (JPX) into a "global, comprehensive finance and information platform," which was set out in JPX&rsquo;s Medium-Term Management Plan. As part of this effort, JPXI is pleased to announce the progress that has been made to enhance the international appeal and competitiveness of Japan&rsquo;s financial instruments markets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_1"><span>1. Further Improving the Stability and Resilience of the Market&rsquo;s Infrastructure</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">JPXI has built J-WS, which is JPX's common infrastructure platform, on AWS. This has allowed it to stably operate the services of the JPX Group&rsquo;s data/digital businesses. By utilizing AWS's extensive and advanced cloud technologies and know-how, JPXI has been able to further improve the quality of its operations and enhance their functionality.<br /><br />In light of these accomplishments, JPXI has decided to migrate the Timely Disclosure Network (TDnet) to J-WS. TDnet quickly, accurately, and fairly transmits material corporate information to the market and investors. Since timely disclosure plays a fundamental role in maintaining investor confidence and the fairness of the stock market, TDnet is considered to be a semi-essential system, next in importance after the trading and clearing systems. By migrating the mission-critical TDnet system to J-WS, JPXI aims to improve the system&rsquo;s stability and resilience and to strengthen cybersecurity measures.<br /><br />The migration of TDnet will result in a multi-layered redundant configuration that uses not only JPX's existing Business Continuity Plan (BCP) environment but also AWS&rsquo;s Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region and its Asia Pacific (Osaka) Region. This will significantly enhance TDnet&rsquo;s resilience against wide-area disasters.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_3"><span>2. Assisting Efforts to Bolster, Improve, and Streamline JPX&rsquo;s Unwavering Mission to Support Corporate Disclosures</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">JPXI&rsquo;s plan for upgrading TDnet involves migrating TDnet&rsquo;s infrastructure to J-WS. The migration will improve TDnet&rsquo;s performance and its capacity to process disclosure materials. The plan also involves improving TDnet&rsquo;s functionality. To implement the planned upgrades, JPXI is collaborating with the developer Fujitsu Limited, which is leveraging its technical expertise as well as the knowledge and experience it has gained from its past efforts at TDnet&rsquo;s development.<br /><br />As investors&rsquo; needs diversify, listed companies are expected to further enhance their disclosure offerings, and they face issues with an increased workload as a result. To address this, JPXI is in the process of implementing a new service with features that utilize AWS's generative AI to assist in the preparation of disclosure materials. Furthermore, JPXI plans to provide a dedicated platform that directly connects JPX&rsquo;s exchanges and listed companies so that they can manage information securely and so that JPX&rsquo;s exchanges can offer listed companies advanced support. In the future, JPXI aims to link the various applications that it has developed on J-WS in order to create an integrated environment where disclosure materials can be seamlessly prepared and distributed.<br /><br />Furthermore, JPXI plans to improve the transmission speed and machine readability of disclosure data and to share it with external platforms through APIs and other means. This will accelerate the formation of an ecosystem where financial institutions, information vendors, and startups can use a common data infrastructure to collaborate in creating new value-added services.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_5"><span>3. Timely Provision of Required Services</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">In order to respond to a rapidly changing market environment and diversifying customer needs, JPXI is developing the infrastructure to provide innovative financial services in a timely manner and to make continual refinements possible.<br /><br />With the support of the AWS engineering team, including AWS Prototyping (an in-house development support service) and AWS Professional Services, JPXI has made various efforts to develop digital talent within the company and to beef up its in-house development system. This has allowed a development culture that leads to new value creation to steadily take root there.<br /><br />As a result of these efforts, JPXI has been able to rapidly develop and launch key projects, such as the Carbon Credit Market System, which was developed in collaboration with Hitachi, Ltd., and JPX's integrated data services platform J-LAKE, which was developed primarily by JPXI&rsquo;s in-house engineering team.<br /><br />Going forward, JPXI will continue to quickly and flexibly provide services that meet customer expectations and to contribute to the sustainable development of financial instruments markets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_7"><span>4. Clearly Conveying the Right Information to the Right People</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">JPXI is utilizing AWS&rsquo;s digital technologies and data analytics services to improve the information dissemination capabilities of financial instruments markets.<br /><br />It is critical for JPX&rsquo;s exchanges to clearly convey information about listed companies and the markets. Currently, more than 3,900 companies are listed on JPX&rsquo;s exchanges, and those companies release over 1 million pages of disclosure materials each year. Those materials contain a wide range of information that includes not only financial but also non-financial and ESG/sustainability-related information.<br /><br />To allow investors and other stakeholders to effectively use such a vast amount of information as well as other types of data, JPXI has developed J-LAKE. Built on J-WS, J-LAKE centrally manages the market data and alternative data in JPX&rsquo;s possession and enables sophisticated analysis to be conducted through the use of AI, machine learning, and generative AI.<br /><br />Specifically, JPXI began providing a new feature on JPxData Portal, which is JPX&rsquo;s securities data platform. The feature combines J-LAKE and generative AI, and it enables users to efficiently search for the disclosure materials that they need and to discover new investment opportunities.<br />Going forward, JPXI will proactively utilize the latest digital technologies to further improve JPxData Portal&rsquo;s functionality so that it can provide market participants with ever more useful information.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_9"><span>5. Future Outlook</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">JPXI has worked to improve the JPX Group's data/digital businesses under a strong cooperative framework with AWS. Going forward, it will further develop its relationship with AWS and explore the long-term potential for using the cloud in JPX's critical functions. It will also continue to search for the best way to realize JPX&rsquo;s goal of turning into a "global, comprehensive finance and information platform" and to take up the challenge to create new value.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_11"><span>Comment from Futagi Satoshi, President &amp; CEO, JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc.</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">In its long-term vision &ldquo;Target 2030,&rdquo; JPX expressed its intention to turn into a "global, comprehensive finance and information platform," and it has been working to enhance the appeal of Japan's financial and capital markets as a whole. JPXI, whose role within the JPX Group is to spearhead the group&rsquo;s next-generation data/digital businesses, has collaborated with AWS to build several new systems to support these businesses.<br />As a result, the ecosystem that JPX has developed using AWS&rsquo;s solutions has been steadily expanding. Going forward, JPXI will continue to enlist the support of its powerful partner AWS to further rev up efforts to turn JPX into a "global, comprehensive finance and information platform."</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_13"><span>Comment from Scott Mullins, Managing Director, Worldwide Financial Services, Amazon Web Services (AWS)</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">By migrating its mission-critical TDnet system to AWS and using our cloud infrastructure across Tokyo and Osaka regions, JPX is improving resilience and stability while expanding access to Japan's financial markets. AWS's experience supporting financial institutions, combined with its advanced capabilities in Generative AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing, enables JPX to deliver greater innovation through their data and digital initiatives. Together, we're working to make Japan's capital markets more efficient and transparent.</p>

<title>Open For Opportunity: Taking Charge Of The Future Of Our Financial Markets - Keynote Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The National Press Club, Canberra On 5 November 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Capital markets are evolving and technology will accelerate these changes.</li>
<li>Australia faces a choice &ndash; to innovate or stagnate. ASIC wants to be a backer, not a blocker of innovation and supports public and private collaboration.</li>
<li>We must act now to put in place the foundations and the guardrails for the markets we want in the future &ndash; and this includes regulatory and law change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for being here today.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, the first custodians of this region, and pay my respects to Elders past and present. I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who may be present here today.</p>
<p>Like almost half of all Australians, I&rsquo;m the child of immigrants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My parents came to Australia from Italy after the Second World War. They met in Sydney, and shortly after marrying, decided to move back to Italy. But when they got to Perth, they ran out of money, so they set up shop there instead. And I mean literally set up shop &ndash; I spent much of my childhood in the back of my parents&rsquo; greengrocer&rsquo;s shop!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, my mother, who was missing Italy terribly, wanted to move back, but my father was adamant that the children&rsquo;s future was in Australia.</p>
<p>Why? Because Australia was &ndash; and is &ndash; the land of opportunity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Australian promise &ndash; opportunity and a better life for the next generation. And it&rsquo;s a promise, for a long time, Australia has delivered on.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m here today with a warning &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>Australia must innovate or stagnate. Seize the opportunity or be left behind.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, Australia faces a choice about the future of our markets. The world is changing, and our markets need to change with it. We shouldn&rsquo;t be passive recipients of these changes &ndash; we should be ambitious and seize opportunities. And we should put the foundations in place today to ensure we will have the future that we want.</p>
<h2>The last decade</h2>
<p>Before I talk about what&rsquo;s ahead though, it&rsquo;s worth taking stock of where we are now.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, there have been significant structural changes in our markets.</p>
<p>The first is the rise of Australian private capital. This sector is still relatively small when compared to our $3.3 trillion listed equity markets, but it&rsquo;s growing rapidly. According to one estimate, the private credit sector has grown&nbsp;<strong>500 per cent</strong>&nbsp;over the past 10 years to more than&nbsp;<strong>$200 billion</strong><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This rapid growth in private markets is a global phenomenon with a local protagonist. In the past decade, our superannuation system has grown to more than&nbsp;<strong>$4.3 trillion&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; outpacing growth in both GDP and our public markets<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;&ndash; and has become&nbsp;<strong>a structural driving force in developing private markets</strong>. Superannuation trustees play a key role in enabling retail investment in private markets &ndash; for most Australians, the main road into those markets currently runs through their super fund.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my first key point -<strong>&nbsp;the growth of private markets has been fundamentally good for the Australian economy.</strong></p>
<p>Private credit in particular has emerged as an important source of funding for sectors that are currently under-served by the traditional banking sector and provides more diversification and choice for borrowers and investors alike.</p>
<p>But while this growth is helping fill gaps, we can&rsquo;t forget public markets are also critical to Australia&rsquo;s economy. And with the growth of private markets, we&rsquo;re seeing structural changes to public markets, both here and around the world.</p>
<p>In the past decade, the market capitalisation of the ASX has&nbsp;<strong>nearly doubled</strong><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>yet the actual number of listed companies has declined.</strong>&nbsp;The top 20 companies on the ASX account for more than half of market capitalisation<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, making Australia one of the most concentrated markets in the world<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. At the same time, the value of equity raised in initial public offerings in Australia has&nbsp;<strong>declined by more than 80 per cent</strong>, from $22.9 billion in 2014 to just $4.2 billion in 2024<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the important role for public markets remains, and ASIC is committed to doing what we can to make them as attractive and accessible as possible. However, what we&rsquo;ve seen is that the rapid growth of private capital in the economy is actually enabling companies to stay private for longer. In other words, companies don&rsquo;t need to go public to grow anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with new platforms like FCX entering the Australian market, new bridges are being built between public and private markets.</p>
<p>In the past we&rsquo;ve tended to talk about public and private markets as if they were totally separate. But what our work is showing is a&nbsp;<strong>convergence.</strong>&nbsp;A shift. From public or private, to a single concept &ndash; the concept of &lsquo;the market&rsquo;.&nbsp;<strong>A shift that will only accelerate with new technology.</strong></p>
<h2>Technological change at pace</h2>
<p>Technology developments over the next decade and beyond will make our current investing landscape appear as antiquated as the trading floors of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Distributed ledger technology that facilitates asset tokenisation could fundamentally transform our capital markets, in the same way as the introduction of CHESS once did.</p>
<p>Historically, investing in certain asset classes like private equity and fixed income, was reserved for institutional players or high-net-worth individuals. Tokenisation changes this by making it easier for assets to be broken into smaller, more affordable units, and traded quickly and securely on a global scale. And it allows new players to offer financial market services and challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t some far-off future I&rsquo;m talking about. J.P. Morgan have told me their money market funds will be entirely tokenised within the next two years. That means their investors will keep earning while value is moving instantly. Compare that to current technology where it takes days for transactions to settle.</p>
<p>And they aren&rsquo;t alone. Subject to regulatory approval, Nasdaq has proposed launching tokenised securities trading 24 hours a day, five days a week, by late next year<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. The American financial market infrastructure giant DTCC has also proposed its own tokenised platform<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And if assets and money exist on the same ledger, we could one day see &lsquo;atomic settlement&rsquo; - simultaneous post-trade swapping of cash for an asset. Add quantum computing to the mix and this process could become even faster. On top of that, imagine what impact artificial intelligence could have on executing lightning-fast transactions.</p>
<p>Once, Australia was one of the early adopters of innovation in markets. We were an early pioneer of electronic trading<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. ASX CHESS was innovative in its day &hellip; back in 1994. And the first tokenised bond from the World Bank was issued in Sydney in 2018 &ndash; the aptly named &ldquo;bond-i&rdquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, other countries are outpacing us. Switzerland&rsquo;s SIX Digital Exchange &ndash; operated by the Swiss equivalent of the ASX &ndash; launched its first digital bond issuance in 2021 and has already surpassed $3.1 billion USD<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>. And in the United Kingdom, firms are exploring tokenisation through the digital securities sandbox operated by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I spent some time last month with the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Paul Atkins, and what really struck me in my discussion with him was that Australia is facing the<strong>&nbsp;same challenges&nbsp;</strong>as other countries and is competing for the&nbsp;<strong>same capital.</strong>&nbsp;That other countries are&nbsp;<strong>actively courting</strong>&nbsp;this capital, and we need to as well. To my mind it means&nbsp;<strong>we have a window of opportunity now</strong>, while so many jurisdictions are facing the same challenges, to seize a larger slice of this opportunity.</p>
<p>But as other countries adapt and innovate, there&rsquo;s a real risk&nbsp;<strong>Australia could become the &lsquo;land of missed opportunity&rsquo; or be passive recipients of developments overseas.</strong></p>
<h2>The risk of failing to choose</h2>
<p><strong>If that occurs, the changes in our markets may not be for the better.</strong></p>
<p>Even though the growth in private markets is a fundamental good, we still have challenges to address. For example, lower levels of transparency compared to international standards.</p>
<p>Compare this sector to the public market where people trade from a position of knowledge because of continuous disclosure obligations. This isn&rsquo;t the case for transfers of value in a controlled private market, and that brings risk.</p>
<p>In a private market there&rsquo;s also a lack of clarity around funds&rsquo; fee structures. Add to this the fact that the Australian private credit sector at its current levels is untested under market stress scenarios. With a large proportion of illiquid investments in high-risk real-estate developments, we have a good reason to be critically thinking about this.</p>
<p>That risk is amplified when we remember that private equity and credit are now firmly established as asset classes in superannuation and will continue to grow along with the rest of the superannuation pie.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that, as a rule, super funds tend to have a stabilising effect on markets during times of stress, the sheer size of super means we need to start thinking about it differently. A severe and unexpected liquidity shock could cause super funds to raise liquidity in ways that increase financial market stress<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>. And historically, superannuation hasn&rsquo;t had the same scrutiny as other institutions that are&nbsp;<strong>systemically important&nbsp;</strong>such as the banks, although that is changing.</p>
<p>We have already seen missteps and failures in the private credit industry as a result of the wide variance in practices across the sector. In recent weeks, we&rsquo;ve pulled up La Trobe Financial and TruePillars Investment Trust for issues in how they are offering their products. We&rsquo;ve seen high-profile collapses in the United States with First Brands and Tricolor, and warnings of &lsquo;cockroaches&rsquo; and &lsquo;contagion&rsquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. And the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said the whole situation reminds him of how the global financial crisis started<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If we fail to address the risks building in this sector, we could very well see our own &lsquo;Minsky moment&rsquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>&nbsp;in Australia with a market collapse. In times of prosperity when money flows freely, no one worries about liquidity. However, it&rsquo;s the first thing everyone will miss in a crisis.</p>
<p>So while the sector is still small, we have time to act. And that requires us to make some conscious choices.</p>
<p>After all,&nbsp;<strong>risk done well is opportunity.</strong>&nbsp;And if we manage these risks well, there will be more diversification, more competition and more opportunity for all.</p>
<h2>The way forward</h2>
<p>So how do we &lsquo;do risk well&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The answer is by acting&nbsp;<strong><em>now</em>&nbsp;</strong>to build the guardrails and the foundations that enable greater strength and integrity in our markets.</p>
<p>That is why ASIC started our work on evolving capital markets in the first place. The consultation we&rsquo;ve been doing since our discussion paper in February has been about ensuring Australia stays competitive &ndash; so that our markets remain&nbsp;<strong>open, efficient, and attractive to investors</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; and that we maximise the opportunity before us.</p>
<p>The report we&rsquo;ve launched today is a blueprint for turning risk into opportunity, and a call to action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report examines how we can invigorate our public markets and keep attracting investors. In addition to our streamlining of the IPO process, we&rsquo;re engaging with industry on amended listing frameworks, new trading platforms, and expanding approved foreign markets for the listing of companies in Australia.</p>
<p>One of the overarching themes in our report is that we want to strike a better balance that minimises some of the &lsquo;regulatory arbitrage&rsquo; we have heard about in our consultations. We&rsquo;ve heard that this is not the&nbsp;<strong>only</strong>&nbsp;factor, however it has to be said that it is a factor that is contributing to private companies shying away from IPOs. Ask nearly any public company director in this country, and they will tell you their job is getting harder and harder.</p>
<p>There are a number of issues at play here, most outside of ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory gift. But as a starting point I think Australia needs to seriously look at the line we draw between when a company is public and when it&rsquo;s private, and the obligations that flow from that. Some of Australia&rsquo;s largest private companies have very wide indirect retail ownership through superannuation and other vehicles. Canva is an example. Is it right that companies like that are subject to more limited disclosure obligations than for a much smaller public company?</p>
<p>I said earlier that our markets are converging, and technology will only accelerate this trend. In light of that, our traditional public and private dichotomy is no longer working.&nbsp;<strong>We need to work towards a framework where instead of drawing lines, we manage a spectrum of risk.</strong></p>
<p>As a first step, the proprietary company threshold can and should be adjusted. Under the Corporations Act, a company is considered private only for so long as it has no more than 50 non-employee shareholders. That&rsquo;s a low threshold compared to other jurisdictions and acts as a handbrake on company capital raisings that slows growth.</p>
<p>Another area that needs attention is prospectuses. In the past 20 years, prospectuses have more than doubled in length, from an average of 109 pages in 2005 to 266 in 2024. I am not convinced investors are being served by these lengthier documents.</p>
<p>Australia must make some critical decisions in the next few years - about how we modernise and strengthen our markets, how we ensure super continues its positive influence, and how the law can better support confidence in future growth.</p>
<h2>The decisions ahead</h2>
<p>The first decision is how to&nbsp;<strong>modernise and strengthen our market structures.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC has already begun to ask how to ensure market structures remain fit for purpose through our capital markets work. The inquiry we launched earlier this year into ASX and its ability to maintain market infrastructure is part of this.&nbsp;<strong>But these questions aren&rsquo;t ours to answer alone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As markets evolve, market operators, participants and funds must evolve too. This requires fresh thinking and innovative ideas from&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;participants.</strong>&nbsp;There are&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;disruptors emerging in the Australian market who are doing things differently. Imperium Markets is an example, one of the players who are piloting tokenisation in debt markets as part of Project Acacia run by the RBA and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. But we&rsquo;re not seeing enough of this energy and enthusiasm in significant parts of our market. ASIC&rsquo;s recent tokenisation survey was one example of this &ndash; around half the market declined to take part or even meet with us, and only one third provided detailed feedback.</p>
<p>Many players in Australia have gotten too comfortable with the status quo. Backing untested innovation means being prepared to take risks. Australia cannot be passive here, we need to be active, to take part and help lead these developments.</p>
<p>If that attitude doesn&rsquo;t change, how long before Australians start to do all their trading elsewhere? It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Australians can already invest in some of the biggest companies in the world through platforms like Nasdaq.</p>
<p>It's generally the new players &ndash; fintechs &ndash; that are driving innovation and may ultimately disrupt traditional finance and market infrastructure.</p>
<p>The RBA&rsquo;s Project Acacia is evidence of that, with these innovators leading the way in developing tokenised financial markets and new settlement services.</p>
<p><strong>The choice is innovate or stagnate &ndash; to evolve or become extinct.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Market operators must also ask themselves are their settings right to compete with these international forces.</strong></p>
<p>The ASX recently launched a review of its listing rules. It&rsquo;s a necessary step toward boosting innovation and growth. The work of Doctor Carole Comerton-Forde in another report we released today, also shows that we need to rethink how our markets compete globally &ndash; from improving listing frameworks and liquidity for smaller companies to embracing mutual recognition and innovative trading models.</p>
<p>One area for consideration is&nbsp;<strong>whether reporting requirements should be tiered for company size.</strong>&nbsp;Why is it that a small cap biotech with less than $10 million in turnover has the same remuneration reporting requirements as our largest mining company, BHP, with a turnover of $80 billion? Or have more corporate reporting requirements than the operator of Sydney Airport, a company with over $2 billion in turnover, which is critical to growth and prosperity, and which millions of Australians are invested in through their superannuation? We need to be asking ourselves, is this really the right balance? How can these rules be more facilitative in enabling smaller players to access capital so they can grow?</p>
<p><strong>The next decision we must make is how we leverage the strengths of the public and private sectors to accelerate innovation.</strong></p>
<p>A persistent theme I hear from market participants &ndash; particularly from my recent meetings in the US and Europe &ndash; is that if we want to see innovation, they need to know what is expected of them.&nbsp;<strong>This is where I see a role for the public sector &ndash; government and regulators to set the guardrails and the foundations for innovation to thrive. If the public sector can be an enabler, the private sector can be an accelerator.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken often about the scourge of regulatory complexity and with rapid changes in our markets, we cannot afford to leave it unchecked any longer. The law cannot be static. Innovation starts with a legal framework that can evolve and adapt and that&rsquo;s fit for purpose.</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s why I welcome the recent formation of the Corporate Law Reform Alliance and their call to revive a standing expert body, similar to the former Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee</strong><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I want ASIC to be&nbsp;<strong>backers, not blockers</strong>, of market innovation. Our recent work with the Reserve Bank on Project Acacia is one example of this. This trial has enabled digital money to move swiftly and securely through our economy in many forms<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>. We&rsquo;ve also recently accepted an invitation from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to join the Project Guardian initiative, which has been pioneering the use of tokenised funds settling in central-bank money<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>. And we&rsquo;ve just released our guidance on digital assets to provide regulatory certainty for industry to innovate with confidence<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But I think we can and should do more to support innovation from the ground up.&nbsp;<strong>So today I can announce that we will review and re-launch the ASIC Innovation Hub</strong>, with a focus on seeking out ways ASIC can support financial market innovations in Australia.</p>
<p>The Innovation Hub, as many of you will know, was launched a decade ago as a bridge between ASIC and the innovation ecosystem, and while operating, it&rsquo;s supported hundreds of fintech and regtech businesses to navigate Australia&rsquo;s regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Alongside supporting the Government&rsquo;s review of the Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox to better encourage Australia&rsquo;s fintech capability, the first priority of the revitalised Hub will be to assess its effectiveness and to do a scan of innovation in financial markets here and abroad to identify regulatory issues and opportunities, so that ASIC can be proactive and help Australia seize opportunities.</p>
<p>Our Hub will have an&nbsp;<strong>open-door policy</strong>. If regulation is an unnecessary hurdle to a new idea, we want to know about it. That doesn&rsquo;t mean just pointing out problems though but working with us on solutions.</p>
<p>Our door is open to all collaborators &ndash; government, industry, universities, and thinktanks. We have already commenced preliminary discussions with the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Perth and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) to explore opportunities to further operationalise the large volumes of data and information ASIC receives<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/open-for-opportunity-taking-charge-of-the-future-of-our-financial-markets/#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>&nbsp;&ndash; and we&rsquo;re open to more partnerships and more ideas.</p>
<p><strong>The final decision we must make is how the law can better support confidence in future growth.</strong></p>
<p>If Australia is to seize the opportunities I&rsquo;ve spoken about, Australians must have confidence in the system.</p>
<p>Many of the issues are outside ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory gift. However, recent failures in private markets have exposed weaknesses in our regulatory framework and undermined trust.</p>
<p>The private credit sector is a small but increasingly important part of our economy, but it needs to grow from solid foundations. That is why today&nbsp;<strong>I&rsquo;m putting the private credit sector on notice to improve industry practices.</strong></p>
<p>We need to see a significant uplift in practices and if the sector can't get this right,&nbsp;<strong>law reform may be required &ndash; introducing new, mandatory obligations to lift standards and address poor consumer outcomes.</strong>&nbsp;But more rules would not be my first choice. If poor practices undermine the integrity of this sector as it grows, we may be left with no other option.</p>
<p><strong>There is also work to be done flowing from the recent Shield and First Guardian collapses. There is an opportunity to strengthen the system for all Australians.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So I am repeating ASIC&rsquo;s view of the need to strengthen requirements for managed investment schemes, improve data reporting, and give ASIC the powers we need to oversee this sector effectively.</strong></p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the work the Assistant Treasurer has been doing in considering this very important issue.</p>
<p>Other ideas should be considered, including disrupting the lead generation businesses that trick consumers into moving their super, slowing down the superannuation switching process, reconsidering the retail/wholesale test, and extending the proposed prohibition on unfair trading practices to financial services.</p>
<p>We also need to look ahead.<strong>&nbsp;One of the fastest-growing segments of our superannuation system is platform trustees</strong>, with investments up 14.5 per cent in the year to June. One of the key themes of ASIC&rsquo;s work in recent years has been to highlight superannuation trustees&rsquo; critical responsibilities to members.&nbsp;<strong>That&rsquo;s why we keep asking whether trustees are doing enough to meet their obligations, including when things go wrong.</strong>&nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t a question for ASIC alone - it&rsquo;s a challenge for all of us. Getting it right will mean greater investor confidence and a more resilient, diversified market.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up, I want to acknowledge and thank Commissioner Simone Constant and our Executive Director of Markets Calissa Aldridge, who have been absolutely instrumental in ASIC&rsquo;s private and public markets work.</p>
<p>Of course, this work has been and will continue to be a whole of agency effort from the Commission who are here today our CEO, the executive team and all of ASIC&rsquo;s people. They have my thanks, not just for this, but for all they do to make a difference every day for all Australians.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So in conclusion, if we want our capital markets to thrive into the future, the time to act is now. That means finding ways to enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of public markets so that we can promote sustainable growth.</p>
<p>And it means safeguarding transparency and investor protection, without stifling innovation or erecting unnecessary barriers to capital formation.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d like to leave you where I started: my family&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>My parents and grandparents made very difficult decisions, so their children and grandchildren could have the opportunities we have today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a classic immigrant story - you make tough decisions now for the benefit of subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Like my parents and grandparents,&nbsp;<strong>we</strong>&nbsp;have an opportunity to act now, to make a difference for the next generation.</p>
<p>To choose our future, before it is determined for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

The term is inspired by US Economist Hyman Minsky&rsquo;s financial instability hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, the rapid instability occurs because long periods of steady prosperity and investment gains encourage a diminished perception of overall market risk, which promotes the leveraged risk of investing borrowed money instead of cash.</p>

<title>ASX Welcomes ASIC’s Capital Markets Roadmap</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-welcomes-asics-capital-markets-roadmap-2025114/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-welcomes-asics-capital-markets-roadmap-2025114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX welcomes the release of ASIC&rsquo;s capital markets roadmap, which outlines a forward-looking agenda to strengthen Australia&rsquo;s capital markets and ensure Australia continues to be an efficient, attractive and globally competitive market to invest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s public markets play a foundational role in capital formation, price discovery and wealth creation. ASX supports ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining robust and transparent markets. ASIC&rsquo;s roadmap recognises that there is a need to continually evolve regulatory settings to meet the changing needs of issuers and investors.</p>
<p><b>Darren Yip, Group Executive, Markets and Listings, ASX, said: </b></p>
<p>&ldquo;ASIC&rsquo;s roadmap is a timely and important step in ensuring Australia&rsquo;s public markets remain globally competitive. We welcome ASIC&rsquo;s focus on practical reforms that will support innovation, improve access to capital, and ensure our markets continue to deliver for companies and investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s encouraging to see ASIC take forward a number of ideas raised in ASX&rsquo;s submission, to ensure Australia remains a globally competitive place to list, including streamlining IPO processes, reviewing listing requirements, and exploring new frameworks to support market integrity and growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also remain supportive of competition that contributes to strong and effective capital markets in Australia. We have a strong value proposition for corporate listings and our listings business competes with many other local, regional and global exchanges and continues to offer one of the world&rsquo;s leading listings venues with over 2,000 listed entities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><br clear="ALL" /> ASIC has stated that it is open to reconsider the potential of dual class shares where careful consideration of the merits and risks are undertaken and appropriate safeguards are proposed. ASIC has also stated that it sees merit in non-discretionary trading plans for company insiders and will continue to engage on the idea. ASX supports further discussion on these topics, consistent with global developments.</p>
<p>ASX also welcomes ASIC&rsquo;s recognition of the importance of simplifying corporate governance frameworks. Last month, ASX announced that it would take responsibility for future editions of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and</p>
<p>Recommendations, supported by a newly established independent advisory group. This forms part of a broader program of work underway at ASX, including recent consultation on proposed changes to the Listing Rules relating to shareholder approvals and dual-listed entities.</p>

<title>ASIC: A Roadmap For Capital Markets To Grow Our Economy</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-a-roadmap-for-capital-markets-to-grow-our-economy-2025114/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-a-roadmap-for-capital-markets-to-grow-our-economy-2025114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released its roadmap to promote strong, efficient, and globally competitive capital markets in Australia.</p>
<p>The report,&nbsp;<em>Advancing Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: Discussion paper response&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-823-advancing-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets-discussion-paper-response-report/" title="REP 823 Advancing Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets: Discussion paper response report">REP 823</a>), outlines a roadmap to unlock opportunities and tackle emerging risks in Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets by embracing new capital flows and technologies, keeping pace with evolving investor needs, and making it easier for business and growth capital.</p>
<p>The roadmap draws on critical findings from ASIC&rsquo;s new surveillance into the private credit sector (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-820-private-credit-surveillance-report-retail-and-wholesale-surveillance/" title="REP 820 Private credit surveillance report: Retail and wholesale surveillance">REP 820</a>). The report builds on the private credit expert insights released in September (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-814-private-credit-in-australia/" title="REP 814 Private credit in Australia">REP 814</a>), along with industry and expert insight from submissions received from around 100 sources in response to ASIC&rsquo;s discussion paper.</p>
<p>The roadmap also draws on expert insights from Dr Carole Comerton-Forde on the forces shaping the future of Australia&rsquo;s capital markets (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-822-australia-s-capital-markets-forces-shaping-the-next-decade/" title="REP 822 Australia&rsquo;s capital markets: Forces shaping the next decade">REP 822</a>) and from EY Parthenon on international approaches to private markets reporting (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-821-private-capital-market-reporting-global-practices-and-lessons/" title="REP 821 Private capital market reporting: Global practices and lessons">REP 821</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said most developed countries were grappling with the same changes and that there were significant opportunities for Australia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This roadmap lays out the choices and future of Australia&rsquo;s markets. We want our markets &ndash; private and public &ndash; to grow. That growth means stronger businesses, more jobs and a boost to our economy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strong markets have strong market integrity. We want to lay the foundations for managed investment schemes and private markets to sustainably thrive for the future benefit of business and investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We see enormous opportunity for public and private markets to thrive and grow together especially as they embrace new technology and innovation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the heart of this roadmap is a clear message, that Australia and ASIC want to be backers, not blockers of investment and capital.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This roadmap is the launchpad for action, not the finish line. Australia should be bold and seize the opportunities ahead, so that our markets remain strong, dynamic and globally competitive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC strongly backs the modernisation of public markets to fuel growth and encourage participation, including support for new listing frameworks and robust trading platforms. The report details ASIC&rsquo;s work to streamline IPOs and disclosure requirements, and the need for market operators and government to closely consider director responsibilities, free float requirements and facilitating more foreign listings.</p>
<p>In private markets, the report outlines that ASIC needs better tools from government for effective supervision of funds, including notification of wholesale funds in operation, data collection, and independent audited financial reports for wholesale funds.</p>
<p>The report also underscores the role private credit is playing in Australia&rsquo;s financial system and sets out clear principles, grounded in the law, for private markets to lift practices to promote confident and informed participation by investors and borrowers.</p>
<p>In addition, for private credit, ASIC will:</p>
<ul>
<li>issue a catalogue that summarises fund managers&rsquo; legal obligations and related ASIC regulatory guidance</li>
<li>refresh funds management regulatory guidance on a targeted basis</li>
<li>engage with industry bodies as they work to enhance industry standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said the agency&rsquo;s work had reinforced the significance of superannuation as a market shaping force in Australia and importance of the supervision of superannuation trustees and platforms through its market cleanliness, financial reporting and audit, and investment disclosure activity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our superannuation trustees are as systemically important as institutions like banks including in their role as stewards of other people&rsquo;s money and market integrity,&rsquo; Commissioner Constant said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As they expand and look for new areas to grow, we expect them to take on even greater importance in public investments and private credit, which in turn facilitates access for retail investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our roadmap sets out a future where private credit grows from strong foundations to give access to opportunity for investors and to capital for business and growth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Acting now to address poorer practices will help avoid future disruption. It is clear increased oversight of private markets is essential, and ASIC will continue its surveillance and enforcement work in private credit to ensure compliance with the law. If we do not see material improvements, we are prepared to pursue stronger regulatory action.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s clear message is we want both options for Australia - settings that promote healthy, vibrant public and private markets - we want to hear your ideas, and we are watching to ensure opportunity and risk are appropriately balanced.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To support healthy and attractive public markets, the agency announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/" title="25-096MR ASIC clears path for faster IPOs">changes to the IPO process</a>&nbsp;in June, and recently made a number of moves to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-154mr-enhancing-competition-and-innovation-in-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets/" title="25-154MR Enhancing competition and innovation in Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets">foster competition and create more opportunities for companies and investors</a>, and to attract more foreign capital to Australia.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report addresses the fundamental questions the agency posed in its discussion paper at the start of the year about the future state of our markets, the risks and opportunities for productivity within them and the part that ASIC will continue to play.</p>

<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome and competition law reminder&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The meeting opened with a welcome from the Bank. A reminder of competition law obligations was read. There were no objections to the minutes of the previous meeting held in February 2025.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Offline payments&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Danny Russell (Bank of England) presented findings from the Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/digital-pound-experiment-report-offline-payments">offline payments experiments report</a>, which form part of the digital pound design phase. These experiments focused on peer-to-peer payments, but the Bank has looked at offline point-of-sale (POS) functionality in previous work. The aim was to assess the technical feasibility implementing an offline payment functionality for a digital pound.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Discussion:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Members asked whether there is research on the proportion of the population that would benefit from offline payments. The Bank expects that further work will be needed in this area, particularly to understand inclusion implications.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members highlighted the limitations of current POS systems, and the Bank confirmed its previous POS experiments showed these systems are not equipped to handle offline payments, which would likely require new software development.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members discussed the relationship between offline POS and future open banking account-to-account (A2A) payments, with a focus on ensuring consistency with broader payment strategies.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It was noted that transit systems such as TfL already support offline payments, specifically offline authentication with deferred settlement, and that liability sharing is a key component of such systems.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Privacy Working Group&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Ruth Wandh&ouml;fer (Engagement Forum member) presented on privacy, summarising feedback from the consultation. Privacy was one of the most frequently raised issues among the 50,000 responses received. She outlined three models of data access: minimum data access, a GDPR-style model, and enhanced privacy protection. The presentation also covered the role of wallet providers, cybersecurity, data minimisation, and transparency. A dashboard-style approach to managing data permissions was suggested.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Discussion:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Members noted that public understanding of privacy in the context of the digital pound may be inconsistent or incomplete. Ruth emphasised the need to educate the public on how data is currently used and how it would be used in a digital pound system.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There was discussion about whether enhanced standards of privacy could be a differentiator for a digital pound and whether smart data principles could be embedded from the outset. Members also raised the importance of distinguishing between innovation and socially useful innovation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Considerations were raised about trust in government versus private sector actors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4: Intermediary roles and scheme rulebook&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Bank presented on the roles of intermediaries in the digital pound platform model. Payment Interface Providers (PIPs) would provide core services, while Enhanced Service Interface Providers (ESIPs) could offer value-added services. The presentation covered considerations around commercial viability, conduct of business and consumer protection implications, directory services, inclusion, and the potential scheme rulebook. Existing rulebooks such as those used by the ECB and CHAPS are potential analogues.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Discussion:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Members asked whether PIPs would be agents of the Bank and who would bear liability in the event of a cyber incident.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There was interest in how performance metrics (e.g. fail rates and speed) would be defined and whether smart data principles would be integrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members discussed who would pay for fraud and infrastructure upkeep, and how counterparty discoverability would work. These remain areas for further exploration.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some members questioned whether ESIPs should be more tightly regulated, particularly in relation to consumer risk and access for low-income users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Members asked whether the Bank would offer a general-purpose wallet. The Bank clarified that were a digital pound to be launched, it does not expect to offer a public wallet and emphasised the importance of avoiding user lock-in to specific wallet providers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today released several updates to ensure consistency with the latest regulatory and reporting framework developments. These include an updated&nbsp;Mapping&nbsp;Tool reflecting recent amendments to the Pillar 3 disclosure and supervisory reporting frameworks, as well as a new version of the&nbsp;Signposting&nbsp;Tool incorporating the revised requirements up to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-40"><span>Reporting framework v4.0.</span></a><span>&nbsp;Additionally, the EBA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/reporting-time-traveller"><span>reporting Time Traveller</span></a><span>&nbsp;platform has been enhanced to align with the most recent changes in regulatory reporting.</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-11/12ad8934-c91b-4cbc-b270-e55136d21e1f/2025%2011%2003%20%28Mapping_tool%29%20clean%20version.xlsx" title="2025 11 03 (Mapping_tool) clean version"><span>Mapping Tool</span></a>, which specifies the mapping between quantitative disclosure data points and the relevant supervisory reporting data points, aims at facilitating institutions&rsquo; compliance with disclosure requirements and improving the consistency and quality of the information disclosed. The updates mainly reflect the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) changes as well as the comments received by the industry.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.eba.europa.eu/Signposting%20tool/EBA%20Signspoting%20Tool%20-%20Updated-Revised_4.0.xlsm"><span>Signposting Tool</span></a>, which helps institutions understand the reporting requirements and templates that are applicable to them based on their size and complexity, has been updated in line with the changes to the CRR3 and to the technical standards on supervisory reporting. The updates had already been identified in the EBA Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2021/1013948/Study%20of%20the%20cost%20of%20compliance%20with%20supervisory%20reporting%20requirement.pdf">Study of the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements</a>&nbsp;as one of the measures to help institutions identify and understand the applicable supervisory reporting requirements, so as to promote efficiency in the reporting process. This will, in turn, reduce overall compliance and reporting costs.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Time Traveller</span>&nbsp;tool serves as a central resource for retrieving the templates and instructions applicable at a certain reference date related to regulatory modules that institutions are required to report. The tool is undergoing a significant update, mainly driven by the latest changes to the related reporting technical standards across most modules.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background and next steps</h4>
<p>The signposting tool comes in response to one of the recommendations in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/supervisory-reporting/cost-compliance-supervisory-reporting">EBA report Study of the cost of compliance with supervisory reporting requirements</a>&nbsp;(recommendation 2).</p>
<p>A similar&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-09/24327300-de16-4c1f-a018-8e5d5ccf8307/Signposting%20tool.xlsx">signposting tool for disclosures</a>&nbsp;is also available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/transparency-and-pillar-3">EBA website</a>, that covers the Pillar 3 requirements of the institutions.</p>
<p>The Time Traveller tool will be continuously updated in line with the release of new regulatory frameworks.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX), in alignment with the German Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt) at the Federal Environment Agency (UBA), has published the 2026 schedule for the post-purchases of German national emissions trading system certificates (nEZ / nEHS) with the year identifier 2025.</p>
<p class="titelblack">The sale of nEHS allowances with the year identifier 2025 will take place each Tuesday between January and August 2026. In September, sales will take place on two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays. The first sale for the 2025 annual identifier will be held on 13 January 2026, last one on 17 September 2026. The time window for nEHS sales will be open to participating companies on the respective days from 09:00 to 15:00 CET/CEST.</p>
<p class="titelblack">On sales dates, companies subject to the German national emissions trading system can purchase nEHS certificates with the 2025 annual identifier at a fixed price of 55 euros/nEHS.</p>
<p class="titelblack">The possibility of post-purchases is limited by law to 10 per cent of the quantity already purchased by the respective participant in 2025 (Section 10 (2) sentence 3 in conjunction with (1) sentence 1 of the Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG)). The decisive factor for calculating post-purchase limit is the quantity of nEHS certificates with the annual identifier 2025 held in the respective compliance account of a obligated company as of 31 December 2025.</p>
<p class="titelblack">In addition, EEX will carry out the sale and auctioning of nEHS certificates maturing from 2026 onwards on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany.

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Livestock Sector Optimism Fuels A Modest Rise In Farmer Sentiment In October</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>U.S. farmer sentiment edged slightly higher in October, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4548503-1&amp;h=3412060244&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;rising 3 points to a reading of 129. The increase was fueled primarily by a rise in the Index of Current Conditions, which climbed 8 points to 130, while the Index of Future Expectations was virtually unchanged at 129, just 1 point higher than in September. Farmers' appraisals of current conditions highlight a "tale of two economies": Livestock producers remain highly optimistic about their farm conditions, partly supported by record-high profitability in the beef sector, while crop producers report a more pessimistic view of the current situation on their farms due to low profit margins across major crop enterprises. The barometer survey took place&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Oct. 13-17</span>.</p>
<p>The Farm Financial Performance Index dropped to 78 in October, 10 points lower than in September, reflecting a sharp decline in farmers' financial performance expectations over the past few months. In May, the index stood at 109, 31 points above the October reading, before steadily falling through the spring and summer. Similar to the Index of Current Conditions, there continues to be a disparity between crop and livestock producers: Crop farmers expect their financial performance to fall well below that of a year ago, while livestock producers anticipate results similar to the previous year. Despite the overall decline in financial expectations, the Farm Capital Investment Index increased by 9 points to 62, boosted once again by optimism among livestock producers.</p>
<p>In previous barometer surveys, most producers said they expect the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide compensation for weak commodity prices, similar to the 2019 Market Facilitation Program. This month, respondents were asked how they would use a potential supplementary payment from the USDA on their farms. More than half (53%) said they would use it to pay down debt, while one-fourth (25%) said they would strengthen their farm's working capital. Fewer producers said they would invest in farm machinery (12%) or cover family living expenses (11%).</p>
<p>The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index rose 7 points in October to 113, following four months of declines. The shift in sentiment reflects more producers anticipating farmland values to increase rather than hold steady, reversing September's trend. This month, 30% of respondents said they expect farmland values to rise over the next year, up from 24% in September. The percentage expecting values to fall remained essentially unchanged at 17%, compared to 18% the previous month.</p>
<p>"U.S. farmers are adjusting to ongoing economic pressures in different ways," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4548503-1&amp;h=1075879571&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4548503-1&amp;h=1598237906&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "Livestock producers are seeing strong returns and remain optimistic, while many crop producers are contemplating management changes for 2026 to help cope with tighter margins."</p>
<p>To learn more about how crop producers will respond to weak operating margins, the October survey asked respondents who planted corn in 2025 about any crop production management changes they plan to make in 2026 in response to low corn prices. Nearly one-third (30%) said they do not plan to make any changes, while 29% said they plan to reduce phosphorus applications. Twenty-seven percent said they intend to adopt lower-cost seed traits or varieties, 16% plan to reduce nitrogen applications, while just 11% said they would lower corn seeding rates in 2026.</p>
<p>Policy uncertainty continues to influence farmer sentiment. In October, 58% of producers said they expect increased use of tariffs by the U.S. to strengthen the agricultural economy, up from September but still below the 70% reported in April and May. Meanwhile, 16% of respondents said they were uncertain about the impact of tariff policies on the agricultural economy, double that of both April and May. Despite this uncertainty, roughly 70% of producers said they believe the U.S. is headed in the "right direction."</p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>Fair4All Finance Delivering Financial Inclusion Together Conference<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>4 November 2025</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion and capability must go hand in hand. People need knowledge, confidence and support to make informed decisions.</li>
<li>There is a gap between access to financial services and the public&rsquo;s ability to use them effectively.</li>
<li>The FCA cannot solve these issues by itself &ndash; coordinated action and collaboration is essential to ensure support reaches those who need it most.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-introduction" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a pivotal moment for financial inclusion and capability.</p>
<p>When they are mismatched, it creates points of vulnerability when small decisions carry big consequences.</p>
<p>Ones you can see in the realities people face every day: in the choices they make, the help they look for, and the support they can or cannot find.</p>
<p>Listening to a call with Citizens Advice in Caerphilly, I heard from someone with multiple debts, caring responsibilities and health issues.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the complexity of the system, she felt unable to act. She had no clear, trusted way of understanding how to get out of debt.</p>
<p>Similarly in Bournemouth, I met a volunteer for Christians Against Poverty who was once a client. They explained the lack of confidence to even pick up the phone and speak with creditors in the midst of personal crises and anxiety.</p>
<p>I heard from Age UK in Truro about the issues in rural communities, with many not knowing how they can pay for basics without cash. Formally &lsquo;included&rsquo; but effectively excluded in practice.</p>
<p>These stories are more common than most realise &ndash; and reflect a structural issue.</p>
<p>We, like Fair4All Finance, have been involved in the development of the new Financial Inclusion strategy which will be published shortly.</p>
<p>The UK has made solid progress.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, basic banking was out of reach for many. Today, more people have accounts than ever before, digital banking has opened access, and cash availability has been protected.</p>
<p>We are working, alongside F4AF, to increase the supply of affordable credit through partnerships and innovation. You have helped expand access and deployed dormant asset funding on inclusion.</p>
<p>On insurance too, working to improve take up among often excluded groups.</p>
<p>These steps matter because inclusion is about more than simply opening the door to new products. &nbsp;It is not a once-and-done exercise. It&rsquo;s about expanding availability of choices at predictable points in life when financial decisions are made.</p>
<p>More people, making confident, informed decisions, and choosing the right tool to help.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-capability-gap" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The capability gap</h2>
<p>Increased access alone doesn&rsquo;t guarantee successful outcomes for individuals &ndash; or the wider system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those depend on financial capability: the knowledge, confidence and support to make good choices or avoid bad ones.</p>
<p>And this is where a particular problem lies. Over the past decade access to new products has exploded and yet, while we have seen some improvement in capability, the rate has not been anywhere near the same.</p>
<p>That imbalance carries consequences. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As of May 2024, 67% of renters did not hold contents insurance. That can decide whether a theft or leak is a minor inconvenience or a serious financial setback. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One in 10 adults are not confident in their ability to identify a potential scam, rising to 16% for adults with a household income of less than &pound;15,000 and 17% for those over 75. Households which may not be able to stand the shock of losing money to scams.</p>
<p>Research shows that fewer than 15% of consumers consistently pay down their highest interest balance first.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t necessarily failures of personal responsibility or intelligence. They&rsquo;re the result of people reaching key financial decisions without the support, confidence or tools to act well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But why has financial capability lagged behind increased access? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rapid digitisation has played a major role, placing complex products at people&rsquo;s fingertips. Crypto, Contracts for Difference (CFDs), FX: all traded through apps. &nbsp;A global phenomenon. The OECD is looking at whether financial capability strategies are keeping pace.</p>
<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s fragmentation. A lot of activity across government departments in different nations, the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS), banks, insurers, schools and charities, but with scope for greater coordination.</p>
<p>Good initiatives not always reaching the people who need them most. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, capability is still too often treated as an add-on under community engagement rather than a key part of how firms design products and services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We know some firms do this well but for others it feels like more of a gesture &ndash; and where understanding isn&rsquo;t built in, and communications aren&rsquo;t built for customers, then confusion thrives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, responsibility and risk for financial decisions is increasingly shifting to individuals. Auto-enrolment, credit offers, tenancy decisions &ndash; &nbsp;all personal choices with real consequences. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the right support mechanisms haven&rsquo;t kept up. More access to information than ever before, yes. But is it the right type of information, at the right time? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the benefits of capability are hard to measure effectively. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because their impact shows up in avoided harm rather than headline growth, the debate over investment risks being distorted.</p>
<p>But evidence we do have points in the same direction &ndash; better understanding reduces arrears, complaints and scam losses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need a single multiplier to know that less of this, and better coverage, will strengthen firms and the system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These dynamics reinforce one another. Fragmentation makes delivery uneven. Add-on treatment makes capability a nice-to-have, rather than essential. The measurement debate delays action.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-so-what-do-we-do-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>So what do we do?</h2>
<p>We now need to connect financial inclusion and capability. Improved inclusion should be the goal, but capability needs to be enhanced at the same time and potentially more quickly.</p>
<p>The Treasury Select Committee underlined this point in their recent work on ISAs, warning against pushing people into riskier investments without the understanding to manage them. They called for a focus on stronger capability and access to advice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we expand access with capability baked in, we build individual resilience and security.</p>
<p>We need to build skills that let people navigate products that may not even yet exist &ndash; in an AI-driven and automated future &nbsp;&ndash; while reaching those excluded from the system and encouraging those who opt out to re-engage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the responsibility of one institution like the FCA. Neither financial inclusion nor improving capability are within our exclusive remit. But we are uniquely placed to help fill some of the gaps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We can remove barriers &ndash; either perceived or actual &ndash; that stand in the way of firms wanting to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Our innovation services have helped firms providing non-traditional affordability and credit scoring tools.</p>
<p>Our research like Financial Lives shines a light on where problems exist and our behavioural economic research helps develop solutions.</p>
<p>We are also rebalancing risk in the system &ndash; not just to encourage growth but because there is benefit to consumers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we have heard that with more risk come fewer consumer protections, more chances for things to go wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If we intervene more with ever more granular restrictions, we may in fact limit the type of innovation required to bring people into financial services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been upfront that some of our revolutionary targeted support changes may result in a worse outcome for some. But not acting leaves millions facing the risk of no support when making key financial decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On mortgages too, lenders have told us that they can now lend around &pound;30,000 more, following clarification of our mortgage stress test rule. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We judged this a risk worth taking, allowing more people the security that comes with home ownership.</p>
<p>People need to be able to make informed choices about the services they are buying, not just be prevented from making any choice at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we will help bring together those with an interest in these issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To focus on capability-by-design at key moments, plain-language explainers, and shared evaluation so successful models can scale. We will say more about this next year.</p>
<p>We will also build an evidence base &ndash; reviewing existing research and commissioning new work to help fill gaps. We will make findings public, so others can align their work.</p>
<p>We will continue to warn about scams. Our innovation services will continue to support firms developing products that drive inclusion. We will explore whether our colleagues can use their volunteering days to support financial education, helping to make a real difference on the ground.</p>
<p>We will play our part, but we are not the only ones on the pitch.</p>
<h3>To Government: coordinate and lead. &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Once the Government has published its Financial Inclusion Strategy, the next step will be to implement it &ndash; turning ambition into clear outcomes.</p>
<p>We would urge the Government to deepen and embed the work in schools, working with others. &nbsp;We are committed to supporting workplace savings and will continue to collaborate with Government and others to promote the successful roll-out of these schemes.</p>
<p>MaPS can act as the coordination hub: reducing duplication, setting shared standards, and aligning delivery around predictable life moments.</p>
<p>On funding, we also welcome the new focus of dormant assets on financial capability initiatives that could reach the most financially vulnerable. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>To industry: build on what already works. &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Banks fund financial education in schools &ndash; around &pound;7m each year. Many run initiatives to help excluded people open bank accounts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The task now is to expand that good work, so it is consistently ready and available for individuals. That means embedding support into product design, not tacking it on at the end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Employers have a unique role at the start of and during working life. But we must also reach those outside traditional employment &ndash; including self-employed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And do more to test and publish what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have made much progress on financial inclusion. But widening access without raising capability leaves people with more choices they don&rsquo;t feel ready to make.</p>
<p>If we lift capability to match inclusion, buffers rise; cover improves; more people save and invest with confidence; scams fall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And decisions are taken at the right time, for the right reasons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust in the system grows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Government can coordinate, legislate where needed, and sustain this momentum.</p>
<p>MaPS can lead on capability and alignment. Industry can build capability into journeys, not bolt it on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And the FCA will play our part by convening, building and sharing evidence, providing clarity, and promoting innovation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Inclusion gives people the tools, and the choice. Capability helps them to use those tools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting both right strengthens households and stabilises the system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The direction is set. The momentum is building. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take advantage of it to finish the job and transform financial capability.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>SET has joined forces with BOI to drive the New Economy and organized a special seminar on "BOI to IPO: Capital Market to Drive Growth" on November 4, 2025.</li>
<li>This event marks the launch of a collaboration between the two entities to promote investment in high-growth businesses, laying the foundation for the country's economic shift from traditional manufacturing and services to Thailand 4.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and The Thailand Board of Investment (BOI), with commitment to being a key mechanism to drive the Thai economy into a new digital era, has organized a seminar entitled "BOI to IPO: Capital Market to Drive Growth" to encourage and promote companies in the New Economy industries, driven by technology and innovation, with the growth potential to be listed in the Thai capital market. The seminar was held on Tuesday November 4, 2025, at the SET building.</p>
<p><b>BOI Secretary General Narit Therdsteerasukdi </b>stated that the collaboration between BOI and SET will be multiple efforts that can uplevel both Thai and foreign entrepreneurs to grow and compete in the digital world through the integration of benefits, privileges and tools from both organizations. At the initial stage, the collaboration will focus on two key areas. The first area is to attract leading international companies, particularly in three key high-tech industries namely smart electronics &amp; appliances, electric vehicles, and digital-related industries, which have established operations in Thailand and have already received investment promotion from BOI, to list on SET to boost their fundraising potential, enhance corporate governance standards, strengthen the Thai capital market, while providing Thai investors with opportunities to be shareholders of industries of the future. The second area is to encourage the current listed companies to further invest in specific areas to enhance production efficiency, leading to sustainable growth via BOI's Smart and Sustainable Industry measures and SET's JUMP+ program. These endeavors are in line with BOI's goal to gear up Thailand for the new economy driven by technology, innovation, and sustainability.</p>
<p><b>SET President Asadej Kongsiri</b> stated that one of SET&rsquo;s missions is to serve as the center to connect businesses with access to fundraising sources, while creating a diverse range of quality products as alternatives for investors. SET has recently revised the listing criteria on SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) to facilitate high-growth New Economy businesses to be listed, utilizing adjusted market capitalization criteria, such as encouraging businesses related to technology and innovation that are profitable or likely to be profitable to apply for listing, among others. In addition, SET is currently in the process of reviewing the rules, regulations and criteria to ensure they are advanced and comparable to the stock exchanges in the region.</p>
<p>The "BOI to IPO: Capital Market to Drive Growth" seminar marks the beginning of a collaboration between the two entities to communicate to entrepreneurs in the target industries. It has provided information and guidelines on how to support the business sector in helping drive the new economy altogether. BOI Secretary General Narit Therdsteerasukdi has given a talk on the topic of "BOI Promotes Investment to Restructure the Thai Economy into the New Economy&rdquo;. In addition, Amnouy Jiramahapoka, SET&rsquo;s Executive Vice President - Issuer &amp;&nbsp;Listing Division, has provided information on "Fundraising Opportunities for Businesses to Enhance Competitiveness". Moreover, there has been a panel discussion on "Upleveling Growth via Capital Market Mechanism" participated by executives from the public and private sectors: Chantanida Sarigaphuti, The Siam Cement pcl;<b> </b>Suranart Kittirattanadetch, R&amp;B Food Supply pcl; and Anuwat Ruamsuke, Kiatnakin Phatra Securities pcl. The panelists have shared experiences and perspectives regarding applying for BOI privileges &amp; benefits and effectively utilizing the capital market. The knowledge and information will greatly be useful for and inspire entrepreneurs, particularly those who are interested in applying for listing on SET or mai.</p>
<p>Notably, promoting businesses in the New Economy industry is part of SET's strategic plan to enhance product quality and diversity. In addition, this collaboration also includes encouraging current listed companies to consider and utilize various BOI privileges to enhance competitive capabilities, with readiness to drive the country towards the new economy. Moreover, this collaboration also incorporates the improvement of the service and application review processes of both entities to ensure faster service delivery for the benefit of the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>This collaboration between SET and BOI is a significant step in gearing up the Thai economy towards sustainable future through investment promotion and capital market mechanism. The New Economy businesses, as defined by SET&rsquo;s listing criteria based on the market capitalization, are companies operating businesses related to the target industries according to the categories entitled for the promotion specified by the BOI with focus on&nbsp;Bio-Circular-Green (BCG). These industries consist of advanced agriculture and food, biofuels and biochemicals, medical and healthcare extension, creative tourism, next-generation automotive, aviation and logistics, digital and e-commerce, smart electronics, robotics, as well as technology and innovation development.</p>

<title>REMIT Breach: Spanish Energy Regulator Fines Enet Energy S.A. €1 Million For Attempting To Manipulate The Wholesale Gas Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Spanish energy regulatory authority, Comisi&oacute;n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC), has imposed a &euro;1 million fine on Enet Energy S.A. for attempting to manipulate the national organised gas market (MIBGAS) eight times from April to May 2023. Enet Energy S.A.&nbsp;acknowledged its responsibility and proceeded with an early voluntary payment. Therefore, in accordance with Spanish regulations, a 40% reduction was applied to the imposed fine.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDUAcDAlQGUkwABAVTHVYBVAMdUFhXAxoGUQoGVwJTAVNUAQcdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT Regulation</a>&nbsp;prohibits market manipulation and seeks to protect the integrity and transparency of the EU&rsquo;s wholesale energy markets.</p>
<p>In its decision, CNMC found that Enet Energy S.A. had breached Article 5 of REMIT for attempting to manipulate the Spanish organised gas market. The market participant inserted sell orders at low prices and significantly high volumes around 17:30, to give false or misleading signals regarding the supply and price level at which gas was being traded at that specific moment of the trading session (17:30) in MIBGAS. This is the time at which market reference indices are calculated, including the market price index for natural gas traded at the Spanish Virtual Hub (PVB) by the agency ICIS HEREN.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the main findings?</span></p>
<p>The investigation showed that, in eight trading sessions of the Spanish day ahead gas market between 24 April and 18 May 2023, Enet Energy S.A. placed a large volume of sell orders around 17:30. Their low prices (ranging from -2.50 &euro;/MWh on 2 May to -16.00 &euro;/MWh on 17 May, compared to the sell price of the immediately preceding orders) caused a drop relative to the prevailing market trend in an attempt to influence the price references at that specific time. Seconds later, the market participant&nbsp;introduced new sell orders at higher prices (with a price increase over their offer at around 17:30, ranging from +2.00 &euro;/MWh on 24 April to +12.00 &euro;/MWh on 11 May), modifying in just a few seconds the price signal previously transmitted to the market.</p>
<p>CNMC concluded that Enet Energy S.A., through its sell orders at low prices and significantly high volumes, attempted to manipulate the Spanish organised gas market prices at the reference time used for calculating market indices, including the PVB reference price published by ICIS HEREN.</p>
<p>This is the fourth decision from CNMC sanctioning the manipulation or attempt of manipulation of a reference price on the Spanish gas market (see previous decisions in 2018&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUBQZXB1JdU0wNBgdTHVZfBAUdUw0JBxoEA1YFUgBWBFUID1cdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAAldTUQNcVkxbUg0CHVZcVwQdU1wCVRpWVwMFDQNUBA4AAgUdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, and in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAU1RTUgBSVUwAUwJVHVYBAAEdCw9VXhoAVQpRVwNQBg9QUlQdUAZVU1tQUQYdVVhQVx0GDwFRGg1UA1EZAlFVAQUAUlECAVtQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024</a>).</p>

<li>Issuance of live, CSDR-compliant securities based on distributed-ledger technology (DLT)</li>
<li>Developed by Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group using Google Cloud technology</li>
<li>Launch follows first successful live use cases on D7 DLT during 2024 ECB Trials</li>
<li>Contribution to advancing European and global digital financial markets</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearstream, the leading provider of post-trade services and part of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, has launched a novel tokenized securities platform: D7 DLT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With D7 DLT, Clearstream facilitates the issuance and management of securities, based on distributed-ledger technology (DLT) and fully compliant with the central securities depository regulation (CSDR). The new offering complements Clearstream&rsquo;s existing D7 digital issuance platform, providing clients with the choice between digital and tokenized issuance and empowering them to embark on their digital transformation journey at their own pace and using their preferred technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>D7 DLT will be first rolled out into the international market and available to issuer clients of Clearstream Banking S.A, thus enhancing Clearstream&rsquo;s Eurobond offering. The first expected issuances are commercial papers (CPs) and medium-term notes (MTNs). Both these securities benefit strongly from the speed of issuance, allowing treasurers to generate funding on an intraday basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets, comments: &ldquo;This is a landmark achievement for Clearstream and the wider financial community. D7 is reinventing how securities are issued, managed, and traded, benefiting all market participants, providing the flexibility to choose between digital and tokenized issuance. The platform offers a unique combination of innovation and practicality, addressing current client needs while paving the way for the future of finance, advancing capital markets in Europe and globally.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google Cloud, a strategic innovation partner of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, enables D7 DLT with secure infrastructure, technical expertise, and cloud capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;Our collaboration with Clearstream on the D7 DLT platform is a powerful example of innovation in digital finance. By combining our secure and scalable infrastructure with Clearstream&rsquo;s expertise in distributed ledger technology, we&rsquo;re helping to redefine how securities are issued and managed. This platform is not just about meeting today&rsquo;s needs; it&rsquo;s also about building a more efficient, transparent, and secure future for capital markets globally,&rdquo; said Matt Renner, President, Global Revenue, at Google Cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Benefits of D7 DLT:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li><strong>Streamlined issuance and lifecycle management</strong>: The platform enables the issuance of tokenized securities directly onto the DLT, streamlining processes and reducing the complexity associated with traditional issuance methods.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced transparency and security</strong>: DLT provides an immutable and transparent record of ownership and transactions, enhancing security and reducing the risk of fraud. This builds trust and fosters greater efficiency in post-trade processing.</li>
<li><strong>Unparalleled accessibility and interoperability</strong>: The D7 DLT platform allows for unique seamless integration with existing market infrastructure, facilitating broader investor reach and interoperability for a wide range of international market participants. It will also integrate with trading venues such as Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s own 360X multi-lateral trading facility (MTF) which can service securities natively issued on DLT.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Successful live pilot use cases during 2024 ECB Trials</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>D7 DLT&rsquo;s launch follows successful trials conducted as part of the European Central Bank (ECB) Trials and Experiments in 2024. During these trials, Clearstream executed several live issuances with various partners, encompassing complex use cases and diverse asset classes such as commercial paper and intraday repo transactions. The successful demonstration of the platform&rsquo;s ability to manage both securities and central bank digital currency (CBDC) positions it for future scalability and innovation.</p>

<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-Uses-Table-November-2025.pdf">Sources and Uses Tables</a></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0300#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;for the October&ndash;December 2025 and January&ndash;March 2026 quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>During the October&ndash;December 2025 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $569 billion&nbsp;in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $850 billion.<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0300#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;The borrowing estimate is $21 billion lower than announced in July 2025,&nbsp;primarily due to the higher beginning-of-quarter cash balance, partially offset by lower projected net cash flows. Excluding the higher-than-assumed beginning-of-quarter cash balance, the current quarter borrowing estimate is $20 billion higher than announced in July.</li>
<li>During the January&ndash;March 2026&nbsp;quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $578 billion in privately-held&nbsp;net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $850 billion.</li>
<li>During the July&ndash;September 2025&nbsp;quarter, Treasury borrowed $1.058 trillion in privately-held &nbsp;net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $891 billion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In July 2025, Treasury estimated borrowing of $1.007 trillion and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $850 billion.&nbsp; The $50 billion difference in privately-held net marketable borrowing resulted primarily from the higher end-of-quarter cash balance and lower net cash flows. Excluding the higher-than-assumed end-of-quarter cash balance, actual borrowing was $10 billion higher than announced in July.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional financing details relating to Treasury&rsquo;s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 5, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Economy Statement For The US Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/economy-statement-for-the-us-treasury-borrowing-advisory-committee-2025113/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/economy-statement-for-the-us-treasury-borrowing-advisory-committee-2025113/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Economic data received through September 30, 2025, suggest that U.S. economic growth solidified in the third quarter of 2025 with steady business investment and consumer demand. Stock markets reached record highs during the quarter&mdash;and have set additional highs since&mdash;while earnings growth has been stable. Meanwhile, yields on U.S. Treasury notes and bills eased over the third quarter: the average yield on the 91-day bill was 11 basis points lower from the second quarter, while the 10-year note yield was 10 basis points lower. Yields have eased further over the last month, nearing 4.00 percent for both the 91-day and the 10-year issuances.</p>
<p>Labor markets stabilized in July and August, with modest employment growth consistent with that of the second quarter. Forced deportation and voluntary self-deportation of illegal immigrants has reduced labor supply, but labor demand has similarly decreased. This has kept aggregate labor markets roughly in balance. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be planning for output growth via productivity improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>
<p>Private-sector forecasters estimate that, given data released for July and August, total economic growth remained solid in the third quarter. According to the most recent publicly available survey (the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal&nbsp;quarterly survey published on October 12, 2025), the median forecast for third-quarter GDP growth was 2.7&nbsp;percent at an annual rate &ndash; an upswing from the July survey median of 1.0 percent annualized growth. This upward revision reflects monthly data that suggests strong private final domestic demand.</p>
<ul>
<li>In just the first two months of the quarter, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) were up 2.8 percent at an annual rate, picking up modestly from the second quarter.</li>
<li>In addition, business shipments of core (nondefense and excluding aircraft) picked up to a 3.3 percent annualized growth rate in July and August from the second quarter.</li>
<li>Anecdotal and news reports suggest that research and development for artificial intelligence continues to propel business spending on intellectual property products.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lapse in government funding has delayed surveys and reports that are used to estimate GDP for the third quarter of 2025. As such, official data on real GDP growth last quarter will not be available until after normal government operations resume.</p>
<h3>Labor Markets</h3>
<p>Labor market data was relatively steady in the first two quarters of the third quarter (see Table 1 &ndash; Labor Market Indicators). Monthly job growth moderated slightly, while the average unemployment rate ticked up only slightly and the average headline labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Total payroll job growth averaged 51,000 per month during first two months of the third quarter of 2025, after averaging 55,000 per month during the second quarter. The slower growth from the second to third quarters, however, partly reflected the shedding of federal government jobs &ndash; with a monthly average decrease of 12,500 in federal employment. By contrast, private sector job creation remained steady at 58,000 jobs per month in July and August. Although this growth rate is below the roughly 100,000 jobs added per month in the first quarter of 2025&nbsp;it likely reflects the drop in population growth related to the forced and self-deportation of illegal immigrants. A lower population growth leads to a lower breakeven rate of payroll job growth&mdash;that is, the pace of net hiring needed to maintain a steady unemployment rate.</li>
<li>From May 2024 to July 2025, monthly unemployment rates fluctuated within a narrow range of 4.0 percent and 4.2 percent. In August, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3 percent of the labor force, and the average for July and August was 4.29 percent. Nonetheless, unemployment rates in the third quarter remained just below the Congressional Budget Office&rsquo;s 4.4 percent estimate of the non-cyclical unemployment rate&mdash;or the rate of unemployment that is consistent with stable inflation and excludes fluctuations in aggregate demand.</li>
<li>The labor force participation rate (LFPR) ticked down in the second quarter &ndash; though the more salient prime-age working force participation rate ticked up. On average in July and August, the overall LFPR eased to an average of 62.3 percent, primarily reflecting lower participation by the ages 16 to 24 worker cohort. The average participation rate by below-prime workers was down by 1.7 percentage points in July and August from the first quarter of 2025. In addition, persistent broader demographic trends from the retirement of Baby Boomers contributed to the slight, 0.1 percentage point decrease in the LFPR for those of age 55 years or older. By contrast, the prime-age LFPR &ndash; that is, participation by workers ages 25 to 54 years old &ndash; increased to an average 83.6 percent in the third quarter.</li>
<li>In the available data for the third quarter, labor demand as measured by job openings eased, but it remained relatively stable after adjusting for the number of available unemployed workers. During July and August, there was an average of 7.2 million job openings per month, down from 7.5 million on average in the second quarter. However, the ratio of job openings (or vacancies) per unemployed worker remained steady at 1.0 vacancies per unemployed person.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, layoffs and discharges remained low. Private-sector layoffs and discharges accounted for just 1.3 percent of employment in July and August, in line with the low rates that persisted during President&rsquo;s first term before the pandemic.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation</h3>
<p>Inflation remained above the target of 2 percent in the third quarter (see Table 2 &ndash; Inflation Indicators). As of September 2025, inflation&mdash;as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI)&mdash;was 3.0 percent on a twelve-month basis. The elevated annual growth partly reflects the strong price pressures from September 2024 to January 2025, in which headline CPI rose by 4.1 percent at an annualized rate. From January 2025 to September 2025, CPI growth was more moderate at 2.5 percent at an annual rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>CPI inflation for energy goods and services picked in the third quarter to an average 0.4 percent per month, after rising an average 0.2 percent per month in the second quarter. The increase in energy prices largely reflected higher gasoline prices.</li>
<li>Food prices for both groceries (food at home) and food services (food away from home) increased moderately in the third quarter. The CPI for food at home rose 0.3 percent per month on average, while the CPI for food away from home increased an average of 0.2 percent per month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monthly core CPI inflation averaged 0.3 percent in the third quarter. Over the twelve months through September 2025, the core inflation rate was 3.0 percent. So far this year, annual core inflation has ranged between 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent, save for the 3.3 percent rating realized in January from when President Trump assumed office.</p>
<ul>
<li>Core goods prices increased 0.2 percent on average per month in the third quarter, ticking up 0.1 percentage points from the rates in the previous three quarters. Core goods prices began rising in September 2024, which has elevated core goods inflation to 1.5 percent over the year ending September 2025.</li>
<li>Inflation for rent of housing services (rent of primary residence and owners&rsquo; equivalent rent) averaged 0.3 percent per month in the third quarter, where it has held for the previous three quarters. Over the year through September 2025, rent of housing inflation was 3.7 percent, the slowest annual pace since December 2021.</li>
<li>Inflation for non-housing core services picked up to 0.3 percent on average in the third quarter, with about half of the growth stemming from higher prices for airfares and lodging away from home. Over the year through September 2025, non-housing core services inflation was 3.8 percent, down from 5.2 percent over the year through September 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inflation as measured by the PCE price index has notable differences in weights and methodologies versus the CPI. Over the past 20 years, twelve-month CPI inflation has exceeded PCE inflation by about 0.36&nbsp;percentage points on average. Over the year through August 2025, headline PCE inflation was 2.7 percent, or 0.2 percentage points below headline CPI inflation for that month. Similarly, core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent, below the 3.1 percent inflation rate as measured by the CPI.</p>
<h3>Risks to the Outlook</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks. However, on balance, economists view the risk of a recession as relatively low. According to The Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s quarterly survey of economists, the median economist projected a 33 percent chance of a recession in the next twelve months, little changed from the 35 percent chance estimated by the median economist in the July survey.</p>
<p><em>Federal government shutdown</em>: As of October 31, the federal government has been shut down for over four weeks, and the lapse in government funding is likely to continue for at least a fifth week. The shutdown reduces current quarter GDP growth through several channels: a direct channel of lost output from furloughed workers, a secondary consumption channel as excepted and furloughed federal workers await delayed paychecks, and ancillary impacts on complementary industries (such as government contractors and local services). Each week of this unnecessary shutdown adds drag to fourth quarter GDP and introduces downside risk to the near-term outlook.</p>
<p><em>Labor markets</em>: Excluding the shutdown, declining government employment may create a headwind for labor markets in the fourth quarter of 2025. Roughly 150,000 federal employees opted into the Deferred Resignation Program to be put on administrative leave through September 30, 2025, after which they would voluntarily separate from the federal government. Thus, the employment report for October could show a decline in total payroll employment unless these employees had their resignation date postponed, were recalled from administrative leave upon agency reconsideration of staffing needs, or had found replacement jobs. The drag on job growth, however, could be mitigated to the extent that employees found other employment.</p>
<p>Aside from the government sector, Treasury is monitoring private-sector labor market developments closely. Although employment growth slowed in the second and third quarters of 2025, data do not indicate the slower growth is a result of soft GDP growth or weakening aggregate demand. Rather, labor supply and labor demand appear to have softened at the same time, leading to soft hiring without a sharp rise in unemployment. This is likely due to a lower breakeven rate of payroll job growth given the sharp drop in population growth that accompanied the Administration&rsquo;s enforcement of immigration law.</p>
<p>Indeed, labor markets appear to remain in balance as labor demand has softened with easing supply. Since early 2022, the private sector hires rate has trended lower and was 3.5 percent as of August 2025, comparable to the slow recovery from the 2007 to 2009 recession. Even so, layoff rates also remain low with the private-sector layoff and discharges rate at just 1.2 percent in August 2025, below the 1.6 percent average from 2001 to 2019, just before the pandemic. With modest hiring but low layoff rates, firms appear to be shedding labor via attrition and planning on productivity to drive output growth. Further supporting for the continued balance in the labor market at a lower breakeven rate is the stable, low levels of initial and continuing jobless claims.</p>
<p>Energy prices and geopolitical uncertainty: Geopolitical uncertainty, such as the ongoing conflict in the Ukraine, continues to add upside risk to the medium-term inflation outlook.&nbsp;Energy prices are one of the most volatile categories of inflation, with geopolitical events leading to large swings in the energy prices. For example, the CPI for gasoline rose 3.7 percent (15.9 percent at an annual rate) from June to September, accounting for over 10 percent of quarterly CPI inflation. High energy prices eventually feed through to other consumer goods and services, such as food (through fertilizer and fuel for farming equipment) and airfares.</p>
<p><em>Artificial intelligence</em>: Firms&rsquo; continued investment in artificial intelligence has significant potential to be a catalyst for productivity and economic growth&mdash;particularly for efficiency gains in service-sector industries where productivity growth historically has been slower than manufacturing industries. However, the timeline for when such boosts are realized, as well as the magnitude of said impetus, is still uncertain. If the integration of artificial intelligence boosts growth as a standard technology improvements, the productivity growth could return to historical norms after several years of above-trend growth. On the other hand, artificial intelligence could prove transformational and permanently upshift the path of productivity as it enables workers to build skills and human capital faster than in the past.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence also could have disruptive impacts on the economy and labor markets as businesses and individuals integrate it or fail to. Firms that are slow to adapt to the technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, as could workers that delay incorporating artificial intelligence to improve their skills growth and productivity.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thus far in President Trump&rsquo;s second term, the Administration has successfully stewarded major fiscal legislation to prevent a historic tax increase, and it continues to seek further cuts to federal spending and incentivize productive business investment. Ongoing trade negotiations are transforming trade relationships, which will put American citizens first and prevent other countries from taking advantage of the openness of our economy. Moreover, supply-side policies, deregulation, and other reforms will protect the American consumer from high inflation, supply-chain disruptions, and the destabilizing potential of geo-political strife while freeing up investment funds for more productive uses and encouraging a significant increase in domestic energy production. In just a short six months, the Administration has made extensive progress to enact an agenda that will bring prosperity to all Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Survey of up to eighty large domestic banks and twenty-four U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. The Federal Reserve generally conducts the survey quarterly, timing it so that results are available for the January/February, April/May, August, and October/November meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve occasionally conducts one or two additional surveys during the year. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans. The survey often includes questions on one or two other topics of current interest.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, David. I appreciate the opportunity to speak again at the Brookings Institution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20251103a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is always an honor for me to return to the place where I held my first job as an aspiring economist. I had the good fortune to be a research assistant for the eminent economist and public servant, including as Vice Chair of the Fed, Alice Rivlin early in my career. It was a formative, if not transformative, experience for me, and I remain grateful to her and Brookings for it.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to speak to you about how I see the U.S. economic outlook evolving, specifically through the lens of the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress to promote maximum employment and price stability. Then, I will discuss how my assessment of the outlook guides my thinking on monetary policy.</p>
<p>I will start by acknowledging that, due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech. Federal statistical agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, have not produced many of the data I regularly use in assessing the economy, such as monthly employment data from BLS and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index from BEA. The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />However, we are not flying blind. The staff at the Federal Reserve and I use a wide variety of data from administrative sources and various private-sector providers to continually evaluate the state of the economy in real time. That practice has become essential in recent weeks given the lack of official releases. These data include alternative measures of inflation, labor-market activity, and production and spending, inflation. For example, states continue to report data on unemployment insurance (UI) claims, and online job boards provide data on available positions. Various firms provide pricing data on a variety of products and services, including housing and vehicles, and offer information on credit card spending, the moods of consumers and employers, and manufacturing and service-sector output. In my first speech as a Governor in 2022, I encouraged the use of more high-frequency, real-time data from the private sector, and I think this has borne fruit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20251103a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;And, of course, the Reserve Banks in the Fed System are a rich source of statistical and anecdotal data, some of which are documented in the Beige Book report policymakers receive before each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, I find broad outreach to business leaders, workers, nonprofits, and families around the country essential in understanding the state of the economy. I will rely on this outreach, these alternative data sources, and the latest available federal data when discussing my outlook today.</p>
<p><em>Inflation</em><br />First, I will turn to inflation. Based on the available data for September, it is estimated that the PCE price index rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months ending in September, significantly above our 2 percent target. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, was also estimated to be 2.8 percent. Both of these readings are as high or higher than their readings a year before, propped up by an increase in tariff-affected goods prices.</p>
<p>My outreach to business leaders suggests that the pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices is not yet complete. Many firms have adopted a strategy of running down their inventories at lower price levels before raising prices. Others have reported waiting until tariff uncertainty is resolved before passing increases on to consumers. New car models, clothing lines, and other products will be coming onto the market, and that process will continue to provide firms with an opportunity to level set prices. As such, I expect inflation to remain elevated for the next year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the effect of tariffs on prices, in theory, should represent a one-time increase. It is encouraging that most long-run inflation expectations, including from the New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations, are low and stable at this juncture. When excluding tariff effects, 12-month core PCE inflation through September appears to be about 1/2 percentage point lower at about 2.3 percent, suggesting that underlying inflation has continued to make progress toward target. My assessment is that inflation is on track to continue on its trend toward our target of 2 percent once the tariff effects are behind us. The big caveat is that tariff effects must prove not to be persistent and that monetary policy remains appropriately focused on achieving that goal.</p>
<p>This is a point worth dwelling on for just a moment. The FOMC's firm commitment to its inflation mandate is imperative to ensure that inflation does remain in check, as I do expect in my baseline forecast. So let me be clear. I am committed to reaching our 2 percent inflation target. Moreover, I will be prepared to act forcefully, if the tariff effects appear to be larger or last longer than expected, or if other evidence emerges that higher levels of inflation are becoming entrenched in expectations.</p>
<p><em>Labor market</em><br />I will now turn to the labor market. We have less recent official data on the labor market, but the latest available indicators suggest that the labor market remains solid, though gradually cooling. The unemployment rate edged up over this summer from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in August, a relatively low reading one would expect to see in a healthy economy. To put 4.3 percent into perspective, the average unemployment rate over the 50-year period preceding the pandemic was 6.2 percent. Since August, more recent labor-market indicators, such as UI claims, job postings, and individuals' assessments of job availability, signal little change to the August reading&mdash;at most a small uptick. Taken together, the slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention slowing in payroll gains observed over the summer. In most cases, a sharp slowing in payrolls would suggest increasing slack and would generally be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate. However, in this instance, the slowing in payrolls can mostly be explained by a coincident decline in population growth due to immigration policy. Because they are currently driven by fluctuations in population growth, the payroll numbers do not provide a definitive signal about labor-market slack. Therefore, it would be prudent for us to consult the other indicators I already mentioned.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that there appear to be worsening outcomes for vulnerable and low-to-middle-income (LMI) households. In the labor market, youth and Black unemployment rates, both of which tend to be more cyclical than total unemployment, have steadily risen since this spring through the latest readings in August. The deteriorating labor market experienced by these two vulnerable groups mirrors other emerging strains in some households' financial health and balance sheets. Among LMI households, we have observed large increases in delinquencies, especially last year, and there is some evidence that their spending has stagnated, in particular compared to the robust spending growth of their higher-income counterparts. This is sometimes called a "two-speed" economy, when the well-off are doing well, while LMI and vulnerable households are not.</p>
<p>Monetary policy works by affecting conditions for the entire economy and is not well suited to produce specific outcomes for specific groups of people. Ultimately, I believe delivering on our dual-mandate goals will produce the best outcomes for all Americans. Nonetheless, it is important for policymakers to monitor the two-speed economy. Understanding the challenges faced by so many Americans underscores the reasons why we need to get monetary policy right. Vulnerable and LMI households are the ones who will be the first and most hurt, if the labor market were to suddenly deteriorate or if inflation were to remain too high.</p>
<p><em>Economic activity</em><br />To turn to economic activity, recent readings are consistent with solid overall growth. Output has been supported by household consumption that has held up better than expected earlier this year. Yet, what has been more striking is the strength of business investment. Business investment has been driven by investment in high-tech equipment and software, seemingly mostly related to AI. As I have mentioned in previous speeches, that suggests to me there is a reason to be sanguine about future productivity growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20251103a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I see AI as a general-purpose technology, on par with the steam engine and the personal computer, that has the&nbsp;<em>potential</em>&nbsp;to transform the economy and boost productivity. I expect this sector to continue to provide support to output growth over the next few years, at least.</p>
<p>In the very near term, I see the federal government shutdown as weighing on activity this quarter. Furloughing federal workers and forgoing government purchases of goods and services, including those provided by contractors, directly lowers output in the public sector. And spillover effects to the private sector are worth considering. Potential delays in government payments, permits, inspections, insurance provision and other functions could slow certain spending and investment activities, and some small business contractors with very little cushion may never be paid and may ultimately close their businesses. I see both sets of effects as being largely temporary. It is anticipated that they would unwind in the following quarter after the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>In summary, after a temporary slowdown due to the government shutdown, I expect the economy to grow moderately over the medium term, supported by an AI productivity boom. I see the labor market as still solid, but I am highly attentive to downside risks. I see inflation as remaining somewhat elevated due to tariff effects and subject to upside risks.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Having articulated my outlook, I will turn to my current view of monetary policy. At the FOMC meeting last week, I supported the Committee's decision to lower the target range for the fed funds rate by a quarter-point to 3-3/4 to 4 percent. I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization. I see the current policy rate as remaining modestly restrictive, which is appropriate given that inflation remains somewhat above our 2 percent target.</p>
<p>At last week's meeting, I also supported the decision to conclude the reduction of the aggregate securities holdings on the balance sheet on December 1. The long-stated plan had been to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves were somewhat above the level the Committee deemed consistent with ample reserve conditions. In the several weeks ahead of our latest meeting, signs, such as an increase in repo rates relative to administered rates, did emerge suggesting this standard had been reached. These developments were anticipated as the size of the balance sheet declined and supported the decision to cease runoff.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path. We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated. Keeping rates too high increases the likelihood that the labor market will deteriorate sharply. Lowering rates too much would increase the likelihood that inflation expectations will become unanchored. As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks. Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to return to Brookings. I look forward to our conversation.</p>
