<div> DSB, Technology Advisory Committee, OTC derivatives, application deadline, governance<br>
Summary:<br>
DSB's TAC welcomes new applicants for a two-year term. It provides technical stewardship, advises on industry consultation topics, and shapes DSB's technology roadmap. <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today announced that the DSB&rsquo;s Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter is&nbsp;</span><span>welcoming new applicants&nbsp;</span><span>ahead of a new two (2) year term</span><span>, with an application deadline of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>23rd October.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Established in 2018, the TAC provides advisory support to the DSB in recognition of required enhancements and adaptations to its technology base and services. Working alongside the DSB Product and Governance Advisory Committees, the TAC is responsible for the technical stewardship ensuring the DSB technology strategy is aligned with the needs of the markets it serves, including making recommendations to the DSB Board&nbsp;</span>on technology-related DSB industry consultation topics.<br /><br />The TAC is composed of representatives from DSB user organisations, independent experts and regulatory observers within the wider OTC derivatives community and its remit includes matters relating to both the OTC International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) Services.&nbsp;The DSB invites applications from OTC-derivatives technology practitioners from across all jurisdictions and institutional types to contribute to DSB technical governance and development.</span></p>
<p><span>During previous charter terms, the TAC has focused on the DSB&rsquo;s resiliency, including the DSB&rsquo;s disaster recovery arrangements. A key development is the addition of a second &ldquo;as-production&rdquo; UAT environment, introduced to assist users with regression testing of their own IT changes against the DSB. The TAC has also launched specialist subcommittees with the Global Agile Architecture subcommittee having recently overseen the migration of&nbsp;<span>the DSB&rsquo;s infrastructure to&nbsp;</span><span>a globally distributed data repository covering multiple locations in Europe and North America.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Andy Hughes, a member of the DSB Management Team and DDO of the TAC,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;The collaboration with the TAC over the last charter term&nbsp;</span><span>which helped shape UPI implementation and its integration into the OTC ISIN Service</span><span>. This continued collaboration with the TAC members will be essential during this next charter term as the DSB expands into further global jurisdictional regions and adapts to changes in digital operations."<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB&nbsp;</strong>added<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The TAC is instrumental in shaping the DSB technology roadmap. The technical expertise of the TAC continues to play a key part in the evolution of our services. The work of the DSB industry representation groups is highly valued and designed to ensure that all developments continue to best serve industry requirements.&rdquo;</span></p>

Derivatives traded volume achieved single-day records over two consecutive days during the month, reaching as high as 3.46 million contracts across equities, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities on 25 September.</p>
<p>Key highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

AUM of real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs surpassed S$1 billion for the first time on the back of strong third-quarter inflows alongside a rally in the Singapore REIT sector. Overall ETF turnover doubled y-o-y in September to S$445 million and was up 65% at S$1.18 billion for the July-to-September quarter, compared with the same period last year.</p>

<h2>Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities unique to market-based finance explain why we delivered the most significant reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets in a generation.</li>
<li>Our review of the financial advice and guidance boundary aims to unlock innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs.</li>
<li>We will continue to collaborate as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether in London, in Brussels, Hong Kong or New York, the same discussion is underway: how do we maximise the ability of sustainable, vibrant capital markets to drive greater volumes of investment into the real economy?</p>
<p>That question &ndash; asked by policymakers and industry alike &ndash; is why we brought you all here today and I want to thank all the speakers who have made this conference such a success.</p>
<p>I know that many of you, like me, have had whole careers dedicated to capital markets during an era where globalisation drove a remarkable surge of cross-border investment flows. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>UK equity markets reforms</h2>
<p>I started my career as one of a vast number of very junior lawyers who worked on the UK&rsquo;s gas, water, electricity and telecoms privatisations of the '80s, amid the huge changes brought about by the financial services 'big bang'.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in the astounding development of China&rsquo;s international equity and bond markets. And not long ago I led the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global regulatory standard setter for securities markets.</p>
<p>I have seen first-hand how capital markets can work well. How they can drive business &ndash; with factories built, shops opened, goods delivered, people employed; how they can support long-term risk taking to deliver more secure retirements for millions of people; and how they can spur wider economic growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen how market fragmentation and de-globalisation can stall cross-border capital formation.</p>
<p>But it's the opportunities that are unique to market-based finance which explain why the FCA has just delivered the most significant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-overhauls-listing-rules-boost-growth-and-innovation-uk-stock-markets" title="FCA overhauls listing rules to boost growth and innovation on UK stock markets">reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets</a>&nbsp;in a generation.</p>
<p>These reforms are already having an impact, ensuring that more businesses can get into the shop window. But the harder task is to more effectively mobilise the domestic savings necessary to grow these businesses.</p>
<p>When we talk about listings regimes, stamp duty, accounting rules, or even initial public offerings (IPO&rsquo;s), those outside this room could be forgiven for thinking we&rsquo;re speaking in a foreign language, switching off as a result, unsure how any of it matters to them.</p>
<p>So, we need to make a case for it to matter to a far wider section of the population. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wider inclusion</h2>
<p>In the US, stock market performance routinely features in political debate and retail participation is the norm. Total equity market capitalisation is around 55 trillion dollars, or 200% of GDP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, three quarters of corporate financing in the EU is bank lending and, as we have heard, efforts to promote a capital markets union recognise the implications of this for the real economy.</p>
<p>UK market capitalisation stands at around 3.2 trillion dollars, or 100% of GDP. But since the heady days of the 1980s, structural and other factors have fostered a low-to-no risk culture, which if left unaddressed, has clear implications for our ability to finance future economic growth.</p>
<p>Back in Hong Kong, I saw a very different investment culture. One in which retail participation was far greater than here in the UK, and where people were much more aware of how the market works and the risks involved.</p>
<p>In the UK,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.newfinancial.org/reports/widening-retail-participation-in-equity-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the proportion of households<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;directly owning stocks and shares has halved in 2 decades. According to New Financial, just 4.4% of UK pension funds assets are held in domestic equities. That has a huge opportunity cost for capital hungry businesses, and for the wider economy.</p>
<p>It creates a gap for individuals, too.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/09/the-uk-investment-gap--p430-billion-in-cash-savings-not-invested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barclays reports<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;that 13 million UK adults are missing out by holding &pound;430 billion in cash savings which could be put to more productive use. So, we are looking to address this.</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review</h2>
<p>Our Review with the Government of the boundary between regulated financial advice and guidance is incredibly technical. Unpicking the interplay between our own rules, domestic legislation and consolidated EU law is hard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But its aim is simple: unlocking innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs, in easy-to-access ways, at prices they can afford, so they have the confidence to make the most of their money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in doing this, we boost growth: for personal finances, for those seeking investment, and for the UK as a whole.</p>
<h2>Value for Money Framework</h2>
<p>This goal also underpins our Framework, developed jointly with Government and The Pensions Regulator, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/pensions-value-money" title="Pensions value for money">value for money</a>&nbsp;for workplace pension savers.</p>
<p>This seeks to ensure the &pound;130 billion a year saved into these schemes works harder for people. A focus on value rather than costs should help providers invest in assets that deliver greater long-term returns.</p>
<p>Through these and a raft of other initiatives, we are looking to shift our national view of risk.</p>
<p>Today has shown that many others around the world are grappling with similar issues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to continued collaboration with colleagues, both domestic and global, as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>ISDA: Derivatives, Margining And Risk In Emerging Market And Developing Economies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Derivatives have an important role to play in the development of economies and financial markets in emerging jurisdictions. Financial regulation, in turn, is a critical element in shaping the safe, efficient use and growth of risk management activity in these countries. One of the most important elements of the financial regulatory framework for derivatives is margining: the exchange of collateral, or margin, for derivatives transactions. This paper explains what margining is, how it works and the key issues for policymakers in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) to consider when transposing margin-related regulation to their jurisdictions, with a particular focus on non-cleared derivatives.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CanDeal DNA, the premier source for Canadian OTC fixed income and derivatives pricing, is partnering with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to distribute CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates are expected to become key reference rates for the market due to quality and consistency of coverage with inputs provided by, and consensus derived from, CanDeal&rsquo;s partner banks and dealers.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA works closely with industry stakeholders to provide data and solutions to support the Canadian market and global market participants. This product innovation is an extension of CanDeal&rsquo;s collaborative efforts with the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) as the market transitions away from CDOR to the new Term CORRA benchmark. CanDeal DNA publishes statistics and analysis resulting from the transition to Term CORRA in our CanDeal Observations bulletin available at <a href="http://candeal.com/" title="candeal.com">candeal.com</a>.</p>
<p>The CanDeal Consensus CAD OIS (CORRA) Rates product is designed to provide market transparency in the OIS swap curve for out to two years, while the CanDeal Consensus CAD Swap (CORRA) Rates product provides rates from two to 30 years. Each rate represents the market rate for the fixed leg of a swap where the floating leg references the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA).</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates will be available via LSEG Data &amp; Analytics under a global free-trial period until January 1, 2025. Thereafter, the products will become fee liable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal is the premier service for Canadian fixed income and interest rate derivatives data. This extension of our partnership will enable our clients to derive additional value through access to the Consensus OIS and Swap Rates,&rdquo; said Debbie Lawrence, Group Head of Data Strategy and Management at LSEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cessation of the CDOR benchmark has been a turning point for the financial industry,&rdquo; said Andre Craig, President of CanDeal DNA, a division of CanDeal Group, a leading provider of an electronic marketplace and data services for Canadian dollar debt securities and derivatives. &ldquo;In addition to collaborating with CanDeal Benchmark Solutions and market stakeholders to launch the forward-looking Term CORRA benchmark this past year, we are honored to continue to partner with the industry and with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to introduce the Consensus OIS and Swap Curves and provide deeper transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside their award-winning Reference Pricing Service, CanDeal DNA provides intraday and real-time pricing for Canadian fixed income securities, advanced and regulatory analytics, security master, and curves solutions.</p>

<title>ICE Introduces Multi-Asset Class Climate Transition Risk Solution - Holistic Emissions Data Now Available For Municipal Bonds, Mortgage-Backed Securities And Real Estate, As Well As Corporate And Sovereign Bonds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of a multi-asset class climate transition risk solution, which provides emissions estimates and portfolio analytics across various fixed income asset classes, covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and real estate. This new solution, combined with ICE&rsquo;s existing coverage of sovereign, corporate equity, and private companies, can enable clients to assess and benchmark their financed emissions across a comprehensive range of fixed income asset classes in one integrated offering.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s new multi-asset class transition risk solution addresses gaps in emissions data by covering underserved sub-asset classes, such as RMBS, CMBS, and private corporates. By integrating this data, ICE can provide a unified portfolio metric that tracks financed emissions across multiple asset classes, supporting climate risk reporting, ensuring a holistic portfolio coverage from a physical and transition risk standpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our clients increasingly need quality transition risk data for underserved segments, particularly mortgage-backed securities, where we have applied physics-based simulations with building energy models and ICE&rsquo;s data to provide emissions insights for RMBS and CMBS,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Head of ICE Climate. &ldquo;Mortgages and mortgage securities can represent more than 20 percent of bank balance sheets, leading to a growing need for data to help meet regulatory disclosure and support stress testing to inform decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s multi-asset class transition risk solution provides PCAF-aligned (<a href="https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/about" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials</a>) financed emissions data, encompassing over 110 million US properties and more than 4.2 million fixed income securities globally. With this solution, clients can leverage advanced portfolio analytics to evaluate total emissions across multi-asset class portfolios, assisting clients in transition risk strategies. ICE&rsquo;s methodologies, customized for each asset class, provide comprehensive emissions tracking, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 estimates, as well as carbon intensity metrics, essential to meet climate regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>This new solution is part of the company&rsquo;s climate data offering, which provides data and analytics that help quantify investment impacts posed by transition risks as well as physical climate risks, such as extreme weather events.</p>
