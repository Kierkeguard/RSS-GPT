<div> Licensing agreement deal values, mRNA-based pharmaceuticals, pandemic, innovation, investment
Summary:
mRNA-based pharmaceuticals experience 800% increase in licensing agreements; mRNA technology proves successful in COVID-19 vaccines; GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb invest in mRNA therapeutics.<br><br>Summary: <div>
<p><span><span>Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based innovator pharmaceuticals saw a staggering 800% increase in licensing agreement deal values from 2019 to 2024YTD, driven by the remarkable success of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. With growing confidence in this transformative technology, key companies are investing heavily in its potential to address unmet medical needs, indicating that mRNA will remain a critical focus for pharmaceutical innovation and development, says&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3D1S2A_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CnNaglJHIY9BtfQD0SgGHFoAHkU4lfJfoyChVKbrC4JKGHwXvXfZCj-2BfmoMVkyVU6ZYXchSk10NUEojNw6UfWE2voX0s-2BsOqaiRpAUH1AR5Z-2BWZdpag-2BezazBFn3DXDwI6buqZZLCyBZ-2FW1PCZP6KzmZNxC734pmZZKEEqdH0vOlYa5Pzcx1Tbxdev2476PtP0vyAY7DKSREJhge3vrOQwqHZvfzkNtR8-2B77otZGu4-2Bw-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the key advantages of mRNA technology in vaccine development, including rapid production, precise immune targeting, and streamlined manufacturing- factors that drove the success of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since the FDA approved Pfizer&rsquo;s Comirnaty in August 2021, the first mRNA vaccine to achieve global market entry, rising licensing agreement values have reflected growing confidence in mRNA technology's broader potential beyond vaccines, marking a pivotal shift in its applications across the pharmaceutical landscape.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Drugs Database, the global sales of innovator mRNA-based drugs are expected to grow from $22 billion in 2023 to $26.2 billion in 2030.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_mRNA_16Oct24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_mRNA_16Oct24.jpg" title="GlobalData_mRNA_16Oct24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan adds: &ldquo;Licensing agreement deal values for mRNA-based pharmaceuticals have doubled since 2023, reaching $3.8 billion, as major players like GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb invest in mRNA therapeutics to address unmet medical needs.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>GSK and CureVac restructured their 2020 collaboration into a new licensing agreement worth up to $1.57 billion in July 2024. This deal focuses on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of mRNA vaccine candidates for influenza and COVID-19, spanning from preclinical to Phase II trials.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bristol Myers Squibb formed a multi-year, $1.87 billion strategic collaboration with Repertoire Immune Medicines in April 2024 to develop mRNA-based tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, along with other vaccine candidates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently allocated $176 million to Moderna for the development of mRNA-based vaccines targeting multiple strains of pandemic influenza. This investment highlights HHS&rsquo;s focus on pandemic preparedness, reinforcing the versatility and potential of mRNA platforms.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;The increase in licensing agreement values for mRNA pharmaceuticals indicates that this will continue to be a key area for innovation and investment. With advancements in mRNA technology and delivery systems, drugmakers have significant opportunities to expand their portfolios, paving the way for breakthroughs in treating various diseases.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Includes all announced and completed deals for companies headquartered globally from 2020&ndash;2024YTD as a percentage growth from the baseline year 2019. Includes deals where at least one drug involved is an innovator mRNA-based drug where Marketed, Pre-Registration, Phase III, Phase II, Phase I, Preclinical, and Discovery stages are considered. Includes deal values disclosed in the public domain. YTD= Year to date.</span></span></span></p>

<title>Vienna-Prague Stock Exchange Group: Pioneering role in securities settlement via DLT</title>

<div> DLT, CSD Prague, securities, settlement, EU DLT pilot regime
Summary:<br /><br />CSD Prague, a subsidiary of the Vienna-Prague Stock Exchange Group, is authorized to operate a DLT market infrastructure under the EU pilot regime. This technology allows for efficient and transparent securities settlement, with potential benefits for issuers, security holders, and financial service providers. The DLT pilot regime in the EU aims to facilitate the establishment of new market infrastructures, including DLT settlement systems. <div>
<p>The Central Securities Depository in Prague (<a href="https://www.cdcp.cz/?lang=en" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">CSD Prague</a>) &ndash; a subsidiary of the Prague Stock Exchange and thus part of the Vienna-Prague Stock Exchange Group &ndash; has been authorised to operate a distributed ledger technology (DLT) market infrastructure. CSD Prague is the first institution worldwide to receive this authorisation under the EU's DLT pilot regime. The approval was granted by the Czech National Bank and confirmed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). From 18 November 2024, CSD Prague will offer issuers of securities to register their issues in the newly created DLT-based register.</p>
<p>"DLT is often associated with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but it also presents a valuable opportunity for us as an infrastructure service provider to enhance efficiency and transparency in securities settlement. We are proud to work on pioneering technological advancements within the capital market," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The technology enables the management of a securities account and subsequently the transfer of shares or bonds to this account as part of an initial subscription, a capital increase or a transfer from another account on the basis of an agreement with the counterparty. These transactions can be carried out with or without cash settlement. Settlement via DLT has the potential to simplify the process of booking securities reducing the administrative burden for both issuers and security holders. At the same time, the transparency and security of the current central CSD register will be maintained. This will also be possible for private investors by using the electronic identification solution "BankID" to open an account with the CSD and access it via a web or mobile application. The apps are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>"During the implementation of the project, we benefited from two key advantages &ndash; integrated post-trading in the form of CSD Prague, which gives us a perfect overview of all the processes associated with the registration and settlement, and our expert IT team with 20 years of experience in securities business. Thanks to this we were able to develop the system in a very short time", says Petr Koblic, Member of the Board of the Vienna Stock Exchange and CEO of the Prague Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Financial service providers can also become a node in the DLT system and thus open DLT accounts for their customers and record transfers in their systems within their customer applications. Overall, this should create added value for companies with employee participation programmes, FinTechs and crowdfunding platforms that connect to DLT and offer their customers an additional service in the securities sector. For SMEs, the subscription of bonds or shares without additional intermediaries offers an alternative financing option.</p>
<h2>About distributed ledger technology &amp; the EU DLT pilot regime</h2>
<p>A distributed ledger can be described as an information store that contains records of transactions. It is transferred to a number of nodes and synchronised everywhere using a so-called consensus mechanism. To add a block to the ledger, each node in the network must verify and validate it. This means that the system does not need intermediaries to verify transactions. The DLT pilot regime has been in place in the EU since 23 March 2023 and is intended as a temporary "regulatory sandbox" to &ndash; among other things &ndash; facilitate the establishment of new types of market infrastructures, including DLT settlement systems.</p>

<div> package, insurance market, premium finance, competition, motor insurance taskforce
<br />
The FCA is investigating the rising prices in the insurance market, particularly in premium finance, and is part of the Government motor insurance taskforce.
<br /><br />Summary:
FCA investigating rising insurance prices, specifically in premium finance, alongside Government taskforce. Analyzing impact on different customer groups. Interim report expected in H1 2025. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has announced a package of work in the insurance market amid concerns about rising prices, alongside the launch of the Government motor insurance taskforce.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-2-1-premium-finance" title="MS24/2.1 Premium Finance Market Study">launched a review</a>, known as a competition market study, to see whether people who borrow to pay for motor and home insurance are receiving fair, competitive deals.</p>
<p>Premium finance allows people to pay for insurance in instalments. With the average yearly rate on the amount of money borrowed ranging between 20 to 30%, the FCA is concerned that premium finance may not be providing fair value. Over 20 million people are estimated to pay for their insurance this way and FCA research shows that 79% of adults in financial difficulty have used the product.</p>
<p>As part of its market study, the FCA will review whether the products represent fair value, how well customers are made aware of their financing options, the role of commission, and other potential barriers to effective competition in the motor and home premium finance market.</p>
<p><span>Graeme Reynolds, director of competition at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p>'People rely on premium finance to spread their insurance costs by paying in smaller monthly payments. We want to ensure that competition works well and make it easier for consumers to find the best deals.'</p>
<h2>FCA responds to Government motor insurance taskforce</h2>
<p>The Government has announced a taskforce, which includes the FCA, with the aim of identifying any actions that may stabilise or reduce motor insurance premiums, while maintaining appropriate levels of cover.</p>
<p>The FCA will analyse the causes of increased costs in motor insurance and will look closely at claims costs, reviewing claims handling arrangements and factors impacting different types of claim. The regulator will also analyse the impact of rising insurance prices on different customer groups, such as younger and older drivers and those from ethnic minority backgrounds or on lower incomes.</p>
<h2>Background&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<li>Read the<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-2-1-premium-finance" title="MS24/2.1 Premium Finance Market Study">&nbsp;market study terms of reference</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA expects to publish an interim report following the market study and proposed next steps during H1 2025.</li>
<li>The FCA has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-expectations-cost-of-living-and-insurance-2022.pdf" title="dear-ceo-letter-expectations-cost-of-living-and-insurance-2022.pdf">written to the insurance industry (PDF)</a>&nbsp;regarding premium finance products with high APRs but low credit risk. &nbsp;</li>
<li>In April 2024, the FCA finalised the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-2-strengthening-protections-borrowers-financial-difficulty" title="PS24/2: Strengthening protections for borrowers in financial difficulty: Consumer credit and mortgages">new guidance for firms on supporting borrowers in financial difficulty</a>, including premium finance customers. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The estimate for the number of people paying for insurance monthly and % of customers in financial difficulty is from the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/financial-lives/financial-lives-survey-2022-key-findings.pdf" title="financial-lives-survey-2022-key-findings.pdf">Financial Lives Survey 2022 key findings report (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(see page 85).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ziraat Bank, T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s leading financial institution, has commenced operations at its new office in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region. This move reflects the bank&rsquo;s continued commitment to provide financial services to its customers in the UAE and beyond.<br /><br />The bank&rsquo;s office in DIFC will focus on enhancing relationships with regional financial institutions and facilitating international operations of its clients, including Turkish businesses. Moreover, it will play a pivotal role in supporting entrepreneurs from the UAE in establishing and expanding their businesses through Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s extensive network in T&uuml;rkiye and other countries.</p>
<p>Commenting on this significant milestone,&nbsp;<span>Dr. Ertan ALTIKULA&Ccedil;, Head of International Banking Group of Ziraat Bank T&uuml;rkiye</span>, said: &ldquo;Ziraat Bank holds the distinction of having the most extensive international service network among Turkish banks, with a presence in 19 countries and 123 service points globally. The opening of our representative office in Dubai underscores our commitment to expanding our global footprint with promising business environment and strategic advantages offered by the DIFC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recognised as the deepest financial centre between London and Singapore, DIFC has earned the trust of 250 banks, including 27 of the top 29 globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) with its 20-year-strong reputation for transparency, effective regulation, and knowledge-building.</p>
<p><span>Salmaan Jaffery, Chief Business Development Officer of the DIFC Authority</span>, said, &ldquo;We are pleased that Turkish state-owned lender Ziraat Bank has chosen DIFC as its home in the UAE to support its global expansion plans. The Centre continues to attract some of the strongest financial institutions in the world, which is a testament to its world-class business ecosystem, legal and regulatory framework and infrastructure. This announcement is a further testament to DIFC being the leading hub for regional champions from the Middle East, Africa and T&uuml;rkiye, making it the region&rsquo;s premier global financial hub.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, the UAE signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with T&uuml;rkiye, which is expected to boost bilateral non-oil trade to more than $40 billion in the next five years, from about USD 19bn as of 2023. Furthermore, strong banking ties exist between the two nations, have been further solidified through various strategic investments and collaborations. These efforts underscore the commitment of both countries to fostering a robust financial partnership, which is poised to drive economic growth and innovation in the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank has a strong presence in the Gulf region, with branches in Bahrain, Jeddah, Baghdad, and Erbil, in addition to its representative office in Cairo. The inauguration of the office in DIFC is a testament to the bank&rsquo;s strategic vision to provide extensive, reliable service across the region.</p>

<title>The Expectation Gap: Remarks To The Insurance Council Of Australia 2024 Annual Conference - Speech By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Insurance Council Of Australia 2024 Annual Conference, 16 October 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improving consumer outcomes is a key strategic priority for ASIC. We are focused on improving insurers&rsquo; claims handling, dispute resolution, and treatment of vulnerable customers.</li>
<li>Insurance can be complex, but customers&rsquo; expectations are often simple. Listening and responding to those expectations is critical to rebuilding trust and confidence in the industry.</li>
<li>We remain concerned about the number of unresolved claims from the 2022 floods. It is time to give these individuals<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW251535510 BCX8">&nbsp;</span><span class="TextRun SCXW251535510 BCX8" lang="EN-AU">and families</span>&nbsp;closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is great to be here and great to continue the tradition of ASIC and APRA appearing at this event, as we do together in many of our engagements with the ICA.</p>
<p>I would like to start by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Jagara (Yuggera) and Turrbal people, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I mention as Suzanne [Smith from APRA] did, that we do a lot of our work on insurance together. That&rsquo;s in a context where we have quite complementary but different roles.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s role is obviously as the conduct and consumer protection regulator, and so my comments today are very much about opportunities for improving consumer outcomes in the general insurance sector.</p>
<p>Improving consumer outcomes is a core strategic priority for ASIC, as announced in our most recently published&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/corporate-publications/asic-corporate-plan/" title="ASIC Corporate Plan">Corporate Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the focus areas under that strategic priority are directly relevant to general insurers. They include claims handling, dispute resolution, and treatment of vulnerable customers.</p>
<p>In focusing on these areas, we seek to ensure that insurers deliver what their customers expect from them.</p>
<p>In saying that, we would acknowledge that the details of many insurance policies are understandably complex. But at the same time, the expectations of people who pay for them are often quite simple.</p>
<p>When the worst happens, they expect their claim to be dealt with quickly and fairly.</p>
<p>If they disagree with how a claim has been handled, they expect you to resolve their complaint in a fair and timely way.</p>
<p>And if they are experiencing vulnerability or hardship, they expect to be treated with sensitivity, empathy and flexibility.</p>
<p>Every insurer has the potential to exceed those expectations.</p>
<p>Equally, every insurer can fall short in some cases.</p>
<p>Where we currently see an opportunity for improvement is consistency in the way in which insurers respond to those expectations.</p>
<h3>Expectation 1: Claims handling</h3>
<p>As I said, one area where we see there being opportunity for continued improvement is in relation to claims handling. That should not come as a surprise, because&nbsp;<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW122954229 BCX8">claims handling has&nbsp;</span>been a core priority for ASIC for some time.</p>
<p>In identifying that, I would note that one in 10 complaints made to AFCA last year related to claims handling delays<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-expectation-gap-remarks-to-the-insurance-council-of-australia-2024-annual-conference/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>That was particularly disappointing, given that our review of home insurance claims handling (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-768-navigating-the-storm-asic-s-review-of-home-insurance-claims/" title="REP 768 Navigating the storm: ASIC's review of home insurance claims">REP 768</a>), released in August 2023, had identified three areas for improvement, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>better communications</li>
<li>better project management and oversight of third parties, and</li>
<li>better identification and treatment of vulnerable customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We note since our review, insurers have boosted their claims handling resourcing with temporary staff.</p>
<p>But we need to see a sustained effort to improve resourcing for the handling of claims, regardless of whether they come as part of business as usual or in response to a major natural disaster.</p>
<h3>Expectation 2: Dispute resolution</h3>
<p>The second area I mentioned was in relation to dispute resolution.</p>
<p>When things go wrong, we see complaints as an opportunity to reset the course and get back on track.</p>
<p>In Report 768, we expressed concerns about levels of resourcing for dispute resolution across general insurers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been gathering data on resourcing in the period since, which shows that increases in internal dispute resolution resourcing have not matched the rate of increases in complaints &ndash; and quite frankly, too many complaints are still making their way through to AFCA.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that those cases can be complex, but four in 10 of the complaints made to AFCA about CAT221 were resolved at the very earliest stage<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-expectation-gap-remarks-to-the-insurance-council-of-australia-2024-annual-conference/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. This suggests that many of them could have been resolved in-house, much earlier, which would have been better for the consumer and for the insurers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently collected data using our compulsory notice powers to assess general insurers&rsquo; compliance with their dispute resolution obligations, as set out in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-271-internal-dispute-resolution/" title="RG 271 Internal dispute resolution">RG 271</a>&nbsp;&ndash; our regulatory guidance on internal dispute resolution, which has a number of mandatory provisions. We expect to publish our findings from this review towards the end of this calendar year.</p>
<p>Alongside that, insurers are also now required to report to ASIC every six months on their internal dispute resolution data.&nbsp;We will soon be publishing some initial insights from that data collection across the financial services sector.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that next year, it&rsquo;s our intention to move towards more granular reporting of that data at a firm level, with the expectation that the additional transparency this provides will drive improvements in the way in which individual firms manage their complaints.</p>
<h3>Expectation 3: Consumer vulnerability</h3>
<p>Finally, we are particularly concerned about the way businesses respond to people experiencing vulnerability.</p>
<p>Our review last year suggested that some insurers were systematically under-identifying vulnerability in home insurance claims.</p>
<p>Identifying vulnerability is a critical first step in being able to respond effectively.</p>
<p>This is in a context where I think it is fair to say that there is an increasing community and parliamentary expectation around how major financial firms in general respond to customer vulnerability.</p>
<p>I would expect those expectations to continue to rise &ndash; so the more work<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW222061180 BCX8">&nbsp;insurers can do</span>&nbsp;on this now, the better prepared you&rsquo;ll be to respond to those increasing pressures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of what we mean by vulnerability, at ASIC it&rsquo;s our view that anyone can become vulnerable &ndash; at any point and for any reason.</p>
<p>Many of the customers that your teams deal with day-to-day fall into this category &ndash; not because of some inherent characteristics of who they are necessarily, but perhaps because of where they are at in that moment.</p>
<p>They might have lost their home.</p>
<p>They might be in an abusive situation or relationship.</p>
<p>Or they might be dealing with the psychological and social impacts of a major event.</p>
<p>We expect insurers to be proactively looking for signs of vulnerability and responding appropriately to individuals experiencing it.</p>
<p>Insurers should expect the way in which they respond to vulnerability of customers to be an area of continued interest to ASIC in our regulatory and enforcement work.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I would like to end with a note about the current floods inquiry &ndash; and in particular about the hundreds of Australians have who shared their stories through it.</p>
<p>ASIC has followed that inquiry really closely but our interest won&rsquo;t end with the publication of the report, which is anticipated on Friday.</p>
<p>We remain concerned about the number of claims still outstanding from 2022 events.</p>
<p>We do acknowledge that almost 99% of those claims from CAT221 have been closed<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-expectation-gap-remarks-to-the-insurance-council-of-australia-2024-annual-conference/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. That&rsquo;s no small feat.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the near 1% still outstanding equates to more than 1,800 claims.</p>
<p>Each unresolved claim represents an individual or family who can&rsquo;t move on with their lives. We feel that it is time to give them closure.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, insurance is complex - we understand that - but your customers&rsquo; expectations are often quite simple. Listening and responding to those expectations is critical to rebuilding trust and confidence in the industry &ndash; and to giving your customers the consistently good experience that they deserve.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="component-text">JSCC conducted its PoC to design and develop a cross-industry and cross-product collateral ecosystem by making full use of the DLT platform "DTCC Digital Launchpad" provided by DTCC and open source software (OSS).<br /><br />When we imagine that innovative changes will take place, this is JSCC's mid to long-term PoC to explore with even traditional financial products how the expansion of tokenization in post-trade processing across global financial markets will create new value, how insurmountable issues until now can be resolved, and what a globally harmonized ecosystem could truly look like.<br /><br />Since central clearing counterparties (CCPs) are the largest receivers of collateral due to their purpose of centrally managing risk and contributing to the robustness of markets, CCPs should explore the possibilities and potential of streamlining and optimizing collateral schemes using digital assets. Such schemes should not be fragmented, but globally standardized and interoperable. Against this background, JSCC believes it is meaningful for global financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to work together in conducting a future-oriented PoC.<br /><br />Looking ahead, other areas of potential exploration include use cases such as collateral exchanges between digital assets issued across different cross-border networks (interoperable atomic swaps) and lifecycle event processing of digital assets held as collateral (advancements with bond coupon and stock dividend payments).</p>

<title>Temporarily Terrified By Thomas: Remarks On Private Credit Before The SIFMA/Mayer Brown Private Credit Forum, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Oct. 15, 2024</title>

<div> SEC, private credit, lending, market regulation, risk

Summary:
- Private credit is familiar bilateral lending to corporate borrowers, managed by fund advisers and legal framework.
- Rapid growth may require scrutiny for transparency, valuation, default risk, and systemic risks.
- Existing regulatory tools and market discipline can address risks associated with private credit growth.
- Banks provide support to private credit, and non-bank sectors enhance systemic resilience through distinct funding models.
- Increased retail investor access to private credit may require further monitoring and liquidity management. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Joe [Seidel] for that introduction, and thanks to Mayer Brown and SIFMA for hosting today&rsquo;s event. It is a timely event, and I look forward to the discussion. Before I begin, I must remind you that my views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the Securities and Exchange Commission or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend and I went for an evening walk in the neighborhood. When we turned around to head back, the path was deserted and dark. Ahead of us we saw the outline of a large animal. It sat motionless in the middle of the path and watched us approach. My friend and I debated what it might be. It must be something dangerous&mdash;a gigantic, rabid raccoon, a hungry coyote, a small bear? Why else was it just sitting there, waiting for us without any sign of fear? We discussed what to do. Though the walk had already lasted longer than I wanted, and turning away from the creature in our path would require a lengthy detour, fear of the beast ahead prevailed. We began to retrace our steps so that we could take an alternate route. Then a couple appeared with a dog in tow. They were heading down the path toward us and toward that terrifying creature, to which our backs were now turned. &ldquo;May we walk with you?&rdquo; we asked with quivering voices, &ldquo;Because, you see, there is a dangerous animal on the path, and maybe your dog will scare him off.&rdquo; They acquiesced, but also informed us that the source of our terror was Thomas, their pet cat.</p>
<p>Apparently, Thomas was waiting for his family to return from their walk, not waiting to attack my friend and me. As we approached, Thomas the tame cat turned from us without giving us a second glance and happily followed his owners home. Our imaginations had transformed a harmless cat into a dangerous animal. Had we shone our phones&rsquo; flashlights on the object of our fear, we would have discovered Thomas&rsquo;s true nature without terrifying ourselves unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Private credit is a bit like Thomas. When we look at it from a distance, it seems scary, unfamiliar, and large. Surely, it will do us harm. Shouldn&rsquo;t we turn back and seek a different path? In reality, Thomas was a mere housecat. Upon closer inspection, private credit is familiar too, as are the associated risks. Private credit has grown rapidly in recent years and still is growing,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;but it is not a new phenomenon. Private credit is just bilateral lending to corporate borrowers, which has been around for ages&mdash;longer than public credit markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The current form of private credit has existed for three decades or more.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;We know how private lending works and the risks associated with it. We should seek to understand today&rsquo;s private credit, the new forms it is taking, and the attendant risks. But we should not build it up into a monster of our own imagination. Doing so may cause us to run away from an efficient, effective, and economically useful form of finance. I hope today&rsquo;s discussion will serve, as a flashlight would have on that night&rsquo;s walk, to put private credit in a more realistic, and less terrifying light.</p>
<p>Private credit generally refers to private companies borrowing money other than from banks or bank-led syndicates, or through the public markets, for example, from institutional investors through funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The private credit market is estimated to be $1.7 to $2 trillion worldwide.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Given the ever-expanding iterations of private credit, those numbers are imprecise and growing. Most borrowers are smaller - and mid-sized companies, but large companies also are joining the ranks of borrowers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Lenders are often private closed-end funds<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;whose investors include pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, family offices, and wealthy individual investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The average loan is less than $100 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Private credit is a form of relationship lending: investors and borrowers typically negotiate bilaterally, which allows for bespoke credit arrangements and other tools to meet borrowers&rsquo; and creditors&rsquo; distinctive needs.</p>
<p>Private credit has several beneficial features. It provides corporations a financing alternative to equity financing, bank financing, broadly syndicated loans, and the public bond markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;It diversifies investors&rsquo; portfolios, while offering them stable, attractive returns. Because private credit is not standardized, it affords flexibility to accommodate innovative arrangements, loan sizes, and terms that meet a borrower&rsquo;s particular needs. Creditors can negotiate for their desired level of disclosure and credit protection. Borrowers benefit from a shorter underwriting timeline and streamlined due diligence, as compared with bank loans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;They also enjoy more privacy and greater certainty of execution than they would have in the public markets. Due to the limited secondary market liquidity, lenders generally retain their loans until they either mature or are refinanced.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Private credit can foster a better partnership between businesses and creditors than other forms of financing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Loan contracts can include protections for creditors, including a &ldquo;structured equity component, high prepayment penalties, or a role for the lender in the oversight or management of the business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Because of the direct relationship with the borrower (and perhaps also with the associated private equity firm), if the borrower runs into trouble, working out a deal with the lender may be easier than it is in other types of financing arrangements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Private credit&rsquo;s rapid growth is partly due to the imposition of stricter capital and lending standards on traditional banks in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. As banks reduced lending to smaller- and medium-sized companies, private credit stepped in to help fill the gap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The regional bank failures of spring 2023 and the supervisory and regulatory response to those failures may have opened a new lending gap for private credit to fill.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Other factors, such as increased private equity activity in the middle market and success of private credit funds in raising capital, also are important in the growth of private credit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The growth in private credit understandably has drawn policymakers&rsquo; attention. While financial regulators have not concluded that private credit is an&nbsp;<i>immediate&nbsp;</i>financial risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;many nevertheless have expressed concern about longer-term risks arising from the growth in private credit. Common regulatory concerns stem from, among other things, the absence of prudential regulation for private credit funds;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;questions about the reliability of private credit valuations given the lack of a secondary market;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;the relative riskiness of private credit borrowers;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;deteriorating credit quality and weaker creditor protections due to a surplus of investable capital;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;rising defaults in floating rate debt due to rising interest rates or an economic downturn;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;potential transmission of private credit losses to private fund counterparties, the financial system, and the broader economy;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;procyclical liquidity demands made by private credit funds to their investors;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;the increasing involvement of retail investors;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;hidden leverage;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;and interconnections with banks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;Exacerbating these concerns is a perceived lack of regulatory transparency into the private credit markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Just as my shadowy cat turned out to be something familiar, closer scrutiny puts these concerns about private credit into proper perspective. A careful look suggests that we do not need a new regulatory solution to address concerns related to private credit. Existing regulatory tools, paired with unflinching market discipline, suffice to deal with the risks associated with private credit.</p>
<p>The way private credit markets are regulated is a strength. Prudentially regulated entities, such as banks<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;and insurance companies, participate in the private credit markets, but private credit funds and advisers to those funds are regulated by the SEC under a mostly non-prudential framework.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;In being driven by non-banks, private credit is not an outlier. Much of America&rsquo;s capital formation occurs outside of the prudentially regulated banking system,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;and that is a good thing. Non-banks are more dynamic, more flexible, more nimble, and more responsive than banks to the needs of providers and takers of capital. They are correspondingly less responsive than prudentially regulated banks to the desires of regulators. An orientation to the needs of other market participants, rather than to the one-size-fits-all mandates of prudential regulators, enables non-bank private credit lenders to offer tailored lending solutions to borrowers, some of which are risky. The absence of prudential regulation also fosters a healthy heterogeneity in market practices and market participants&rsquo; behavior, which supports systemic resilience. Fundamentally, moving the risks associated with credit off bank balance sheets with their government backstop and into the capital markets, where fund investors&rsquo; equity is the backstop, enhances systemic resilience.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Lock-ups and other restrictions on private investor redemptions mitigate run risk. Private credit funds typically match the duration of their assets and liabilities by drawing capital from long-term investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;Most private credit funds are closed-end funds with terms of approximately five years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;Investors face withdrawal restrictions, which create a stable capital base.</p>
<p>Although private credit has performed well, even during times of stress, default<i>&nbsp;</i>risk in private credit is real.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;The borrowers are often small- to medium-sized companies that are risky, and changes in economic conditions or interest rates can amplify the risk. Private credit has solutions here too. Because private credit lenders typically hold loans until maturity, rather than originate loans to distribute them as banks often do,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;they have an incentive to conduct thorough due diligence, negotiate strong covenants,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;and devise workable solutions if borrowers cannot pay.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;Investors who add private credit because of its high returns can expect to absorb some losses,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;but their losses are not a concern to the broader economy, and private credit is typically only a small piece of a diversified portfolio. Private credit fund advisers know how to&mdash;and have the incentive and ability&mdash;to mitigate default risk ex ante through diversification, disclosure requirements, and other creditor protections and to restructure loans that have gone bad.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;While the popularity of the asset class has pulled in a lot of capital, which could lead to lower credit quality loans and weaker creditor protections, professional managers have fiduciary duties to the private credit funds they manage. Loan covenants do not appear to be deteriorating meaningfully, though that is something for investors to keep an eye on, and private credit increasingly serves larger and investment-grade borrowers.</p>
<p>Inaccurate valuations are also a real concern, but likewise not a cause for excessive worry. The lack of a secondary market and the bespoke nature of private credit make valuing outstanding loans difficult.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>&nbsp;Risks associated with valuation are mitigated, however, by the long-term nature of private credit investing; private credit funds generally hold loans until they are paid off or refinanced. Moreover, as private credit finds its way into publicly traded vehicles, such as BDCs or private credit exchange-traded funds, public markets will be able to test valuations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></p>
<p>Concerns that problems in the private credit markets will spill into the financial system and broader economy are the latest iteration of the incessant systemic risk critiques of asset managers, hedge funds, and registered investment companies. Prudential regulators almost reflexively look askance at the non-bank sector because it intentionally elevates private decision-making over regulatory decision-making. Asset managers, funds, and investors are a wonderful cacophony of market participants, each marching to its own drummer. While the idiosyncratic nature of the private credit markets makes it hard to neatly categorize and study, it also is a crucial aspect of the sector&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Market participants have ways to protect themselves that also protect the broader financial system. Private fund counterparties, including banks with the oversight of their regulators, can implement risk mitigants to prevent the transmission of private credit losses. Lock-up periods and other limitations on withdrawals avert runs on private credit funds. Investors in private credit funds may face procyclical capital calls during times of stress, but investors know their exposure ahead of time and so can plan for it. Retail investor access to this asset class may occur through publicly traded funds.</p>
<p>Banks not only compete with, but support and benefit from the private credit market. Banks lend money to private credit funds, transfer risk from their balance sheets to private credit funds, and set up joint private credit ventures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>&nbsp;Private credit funds generally operate with less leverage than banks, which protects them and the broader financial system.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a>&nbsp;As the relationships between private credit funds and banks evolve, we should watch for hidden leverage, regulatory arbitrage, and hidden interconnections with banks, but the heterogeneity of those arrangements protects against a system-wide problem. In general, we should welcome the movement of risk from bank balance sheets to private credit funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>&nbsp;To keep things in perspective, despite the growth in recent years, private credit is considerably smaller than the banking sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Although private credit seems to show more promise than peril, as a growing sector of the market, it deserves scrutiny from market participants, academics, and regulators. Using the tools we already have, we can monitor the private credit space as it expands and evolves. The public, creditors, and regulators already have information about the private credit markets. As the sector grows, public analyses of the market have proliferated. Creditors can negotiate substantial access to information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>&nbsp;Bank regulators and supervisors can look at banks&rsquo; relationships with private credit funds. Form PF, which the SEC recently expanded twice over my objection,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>&nbsp;provides detailed information to FSOC, the SEC, and the CFTC about certain private funds, including information relevant to private credit, investment losses, and fund outflows. But some regulators want more.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>&nbsp;To stretch my walk analogy past its breaking point, they want to turn on the flood lights to illuminate the entire neighborhood instead of pulling out the phone lights we already have to look at particular items of interest. Why should regulators have more detailed information about bilateral relationships between lenders and their borrowers? The creditors in these transactions can negotiate for the transparency they need to assess their risk and deal with problems as they arise. What precisely would the government do with such information, if it had it? Design a bailout for private credit funds during a wave of defaults? I hope not. After all, one of the strengths of the non-bank financial system is its absence of a federal safety net, which has a way of focusing minds on risk management.</p>
<p>Invoking systemic risk to regulate private credit in the same way we regulate bank lending would engender risks of its own. Doing so would squelch the dynamism that enables the non-bank sector to serve companies and investors so well. It would homogenize the market, which could make future financial contagion more, not less, likely. It would construct yet another obstacle to small business access to capital.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>&nbsp;If anything, the growing private credit sector may highlight the need for streamlining our&nbsp;<i>public&nbsp;</i>market regulation. I have expressed concerns about the costs of accessing our public equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>&nbsp;We should ask similar questions about our public debt markets. Publicly traded bonds are not right for every company at every stage of its life, and private credit is sometimes the right solution when bonds are not. But can we do anything to improve the way the bond markets work so that they serve more companies than they do now?</p>
<p>When I think back to that evening stroll marred by my fear of Thomas, I am a bit embarrassed at my there-is-a-monster-under-the-bed approach to the situation. A calmer method to discerning what I was seeing would have served me better. We ought never to be ashamed about keeping our eyes out for unusual features looming in the financial landscape or about asking whether those features carry risks that are not being taken into account by market participants. But in doing so we must assess problems and design solutions rationally rather than cowering in fear at a what turns out to be a domesticated cat&rsquo;s silhouette. I look forward to further discussion of these issues on the panels ahead.</p>

They get full access to the management team and directly influence the decisions made by the board. Such access also helps to establish relational finance.

<div> enforcement action, civil monetary penalties, restitution, fraud, misappropriation <br />
Summary:<br /> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a civil enforcement action against multiple companies and individuals for fraudulent solicitation of funds and misappropriation. <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Traders Domain FX LTD. d/b/a The Traders Domain</span>, a St. Vincent and the Grenadines company with principal operations in Canada, and its two co-founders,&nbsp;<span>Fredirick Teddy Joseph Safranko, a/k/a Ted Safranko</span>, of Ontario or British Columbia, Canada, and&nbsp;<span>David William Negus-Romvari</span>&nbsp;of Ontario, Canada and Mexico</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Ares Global Ltd. d/b/a Trubluefx</span>, a Saint Lucia company</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Algo Capital LLC</span>, a Florida company</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Algo FX Capital Advisor LLC n/k/a Quant5 Advisor LLC.</span>, a Delaware company with principal operations in Medley, Florida, and four of their officers and agents including&nbsp;<span>Robert Collazo Jr.</span>&nbsp;of Miami Lakes, Florida<span>, Juan Jose Herman a/k/a/ JJ Herman</span>&nbsp;of Miami, John Fortini of North Miami, Florida, and&nbsp;<span>Stephen Likos</span>&nbsp;of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Michael Shannon Sims</span>&nbsp;of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Holton Buggs Jr.</span>, of Houston</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Centurion Capital Group Inc.</span>, a Florida company, and three of its officers and agents including&nbsp;<span>Alejandro Santiestaban a/k/a Alex Santi, Gabriel Beltran</span>, both of Hialeah, Florida, and&nbsp;<span>Archie Rice&nbsp;</span>of Fulshear, Texas&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>The complaint alleges that, among other things, the defendants individually, and at times working in conjunction, made material fraudulent representations to their customers and misappropriated customer funds. In sum, more than 2,000 customers deposited no less than $283 million in connection with the alleged fraud.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, restitution, trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On Oct. 3, Federal District Court Judge Roy K. Altman entered a statutory restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and giving the CFTC immediate access to their books and records. The court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for Oct. 29.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The complaint alleges from at least November 2019 through the present, TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari orchestrated a multi-layered scheme to solicit funds for trading leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, specifically gold-to-U.S. dollar pairs (XAU/USD), as well as assorted other commodities, through pooled and individual accounts.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The complaint states TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari<span>&nbsp;</span>made fraudulent and material oral and written misrepresentations and omissions, and misappropriated customer funds. The complaint alleges TD and Safranko falsified trading records and TD&rsquo;s successor, Trubluefx, further misappropriated customer funds by failing to refund the money despite repeated attempts by thousands of customers to access and/or liquidate their accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to the complaint, TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari also used other individuals and entities (sponsors) on TD&rsquo;s behalf, with each sponsor acting like a spoke extending from the TD hub.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The sponsors Algo Capital and Algo FX Capital Advisor n/k/a Quant5, and their agents Collazo, Herman, Fortini, and Likos; Sims; Buggs; and Centurion, and its agents Santi, Beltran, and Rice, also fraudulently solicited customers and misappropriated funds. The sponsors actively downplayed red flags and continued to solicit customers, helping to create the false impression customers were participating in legitimate trading even as the scheme was on the brink of collapse.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the fall of 2022, customers began to experience extreme withdrawal delays and/or were unable to withdraw their funds. According to the complaint, TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari, and the sponsor defendants provided numerous, conflicting excuses for the delays &mdash; falsely assuring customers their funds were safe, and withdrawals would be processed. All while the sponsor defendants continued to solicit funds from new and existing customers to be traded in the TD Pool, allowing the defendants to continue their fraudulent scheme for more than six months and bilk customers out of millions of additional dollars.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the&nbsp;assistance of the National Futures Association, Ontario Securities Commission, the Financial Services Authority Saint Vincent &amp; The Grenadines, Finantsinspektsioon (Estonian Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority), and Vanuatu Financial&nbsp;Services Commission.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Alison B. Wilson, Sean Hennessy, Sarah Wastler, Kelly Folks, Maura Viehmeyer, Michelle Bougas, Erica Bodin, Stephanie Cooper, and Rick Glaser. Jeremy Christianson and Christopher Beatty from the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Data and Technology also assisted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_commoditypool.html">Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</a>, which&nbsp;provides information&nbsp;about a type of fraud involving individuals and firms, often unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.&nbsp;The&nbsp;CFTC&nbsp;also urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>&nbsp;before investing funds. If an entity is unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, should be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint&nbsp;</a>online or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">CFTC Whistleblower Office</a>.&nbsp;Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</span></span></p>

<title>US Federal And State Financial Regulatory Agencies Issue Interagency Statement On Supervisory Practices Regarding Financial Institutions Affected By Hurricane Milton</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-and-state-financial-regulatory-agencies-issue-interagency-statement-o-11/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-and-state-financial-regulatory-agencies-issue-interagency-statement-o-11/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Hurricane Milton, regulatory assistance, lending, temporary facilities, publishing requirements<br />
Summary: The agencies provide regulatory assistance, encourage lending to affected areas, expedite temporary facility requests, offer CRA consideration, and encourage monitoring investments.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of Hurricane Milton on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations</a>.</p>
<p><span>Lending:</span>&nbsp;The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Milton. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings or modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as applicable. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification. In supervising institutions affected by Hurricane Milton, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.</p>
<p><span>Temporary Facilities:</span>&nbsp;The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricane Milton. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Hurricane Milton. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><span>Publishing Requirements:</span>&nbsp;The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricane Milton may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator.</p>
<p><span>Regulatory Reporting Requirements:</span>&nbsp;Institutions affected by Hurricane Milton that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies&rsquo; reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies&rsquo; regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of Hurricane Milton.</p>
<p>The agencies&rsquo; staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution&rsquo;s particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.</p>
<p><span>Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):</span>&nbsp;Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm</a>.</p>
<p><span>Investments:</span>&nbsp;Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by Hurricane Milton. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.</p>

Summary: The European Supervisory Authorities raised concerns over the proposed changes to the draft Implementing Technical Standards on the registers of information under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). They reject the addition of the European Unique Identifier (EUID) and call for further changes to the draft ITS. The ESAs also call for the swift adoption of the draft ITS by the EC and for financial entities to increase their implementation efforts. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) today issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/JC_2024_75_-_Opinion_on_the_rejection_of_the_ITS_on_RoI_under_DORA.pdf">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC)&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d7f731c6-39a7-42e5-bd4b-f28434b7d51d_en?filename=240723-letter-esma-dora-register-information_en.pdf">rejection</a>&nbsp;of the draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the registers of information under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). The ESAs raise concerns over the impacts and practicalities of the proposed EC changes to the draft ITS on the registers of information in relation to financial entities&rsquo; contractual arrangements&nbsp;<a>with ICT third-party service providers.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The&nbsp;draft ITS proposed by the ESAs were&nbsp;rejected&nbsp;by the EC on the&nbsp;grounds that it is necessary to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;financial entities&nbsp;the choice of identifying their ICT third-party service providers&nbsp;registered in the EU&nbsp;either&nbsp;by using the&nbsp;Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)&nbsp;or by using&nbsp;the European Unique Identifier (EUID).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ESAs view, the EC&rsquo;s proposal of adding an additional identifier, allowing EU-based companies to use the EUID, will cause unnecessary complexity and could have negative impacts on the implementation of DORA by financial entities, competent authorities and the ESAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ESAs note that, although the EUID is available free of charge to&nbsp;<a>EU-registered companies</a>, its introduction in the registers of information would entail unforeseen implementation and maintenance efforts for the financial entities. In particular, it would limit the access to and &nbsp;the possibility for verification of the information by the financial entities and competent authorities. This would lead to a potential increase in the overall reporting burden for financial entities in the context of DORA. In addition, the coexistence of two identifiers could bring additional complexity that would negatively impact the quality of data used, and risk delays in the designation of critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) by the ESAs.</p>
<p>If the EC decides to proceed with the introduction of the EUID<a>, despite the above</a>&nbsp;concerns,&nbsp;additional changes to the draft ITS will be necessary. The Opinion indicates how the&nbsp;draft ITS should be adapted&nbsp;further to cater for the use of the EUID.&nbsp;Without these changes, the ITS could not be&nbsp;practically&nbsp;applied for&nbsp;a proper&nbsp;identification of&nbsp;the ICT third-party service providers, which would negatively impact the designation of CTPPs. The ESAs also note that in the case of co-existence of both LEI and EUID, the financial entities should be given the preference for using LEI, especially where both identifiers are available to them, and for the case of groups, it is important to ensure homogeneity in the registered identification codes for all ICT third-party service providers.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The ESAs also suggest&nbsp;in their Opinion&nbsp;further changes to the&nbsp;draft&nbsp;ITS, reflecting the practical feedback received from financial entities participating in the voluntary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/direct-supervision-and-oversight/digital-operational-resilience-act/preparation-dora-application">dry run exercise on reporting of registers of information</a>.</p>
<p>The ESAs call for the final decision on the use of identifiers and the swift adoption of the draft ITS by the EC. This is particularly relevant for the ESAs, who will be designating CTPPs in 2025. Finally, leveraging on the experience of the dry run exercise, the ESAs call financial entities to increase their implementation efforts in order to be ready to submit their registers of information to the competent authorities in the first half of 2025.</p>
<h4><span>Background and legal basis</span></h4>
<p><a>Article 28(9) of DORA (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) mandates the ESAs to develop draft ITS to establish the standard templates for the register of information referred to in Article 28(3) of DORA. The draft ITS was developed and submitted by the ESAs to the EU Commission on 17 January 2024.</a></p>
<p>The registers of information maintained by the financial entities serve as an important input for the ESAs&rsquo; work on the designation of CTPPs that will be subject to the oversight by the ESAs.</p>
<p>On 3 September 2024, the European Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure set out in the fourth subparagraph of Article 15(1) of the ESAs Regulations,&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d7f731c6-39a7-42e5-bd4b-f28434b7d51d_en?filename=240723-letter-esma-dora-register-information_en.pdf">notified the ESAs of the rejection of the ITS</a>&nbsp;on the basis of the envisaged mandatory use of the LEI to identify ICT third-party service providers under Article 3(5) and (6) of the draft ITS.</p>
<p><a>Pursuant to Article 15(4) of the ESAs Regulation, the ESAs prepared this Opinion on the proposed amendments to the draft ITS by the EU Commission. In addition, the ESAs also suggested some other changes to the draft ITS based on the experience and feedback received from the industry during &nbsp;the &lsquo;dry run&rsquo; exercise the ESAs carried out during 2024 to support the industry in the preparation for submission of the registers of information and to test the reporting process.</a></p>

<title>BIS: CPMI Reports To G20 On Fast Payment System Interlinking And APIs Provide Insights And Recommendations To Enhance Cross-Border Payments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> interlinking, interoperability, fast payment systems, APIs, cross-border payments
Summary: The CPMI published reports on interlinking fast payment systems and harmonizing APIs for cross-border payments, offering key recommendations for governance and oversight. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li>CPMI publishes two reports offering insights into enhancing cross-border payments by facilitating the interlinking and interoperability of payment systems.</li>
<li>Report on the interlinking of fast payment systems aims to support private and public stakeholders when deciding on the governance and oversight of these arrangements.</li>
<li>Report on greater harmonisation of the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) sets out 10 key recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) today published two reports to the G20 that offer key insights and recommendations on the interlinking and interoperability of payment systems to enhance cross-border payments.</p>
<p><strong><em>Linking fast payment systems across borders: governance and oversight</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, fast payment systems (FPS) are designed and used mainly for domestic retail payments. Interlinking them across different jurisdictions could expand the end user experience of low-cost, fast, easy to access and transparent payments to the cross-border dimension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunities to foster cross-border FPS interlinking have grown with the proliferation of FPS globally and with trends towards greater interoperability at the technical level. The growing use of application programming interfaces (APIs) and the adoption of the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard have opened up new possibilities to facilitate payment system interlinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, agreeing on workable governance and oversight arrangements is challenging due to the multi-jurisdictional, cross-border and/or cross-currency nature of these arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on an earlier CPMI report that lays out the benefits and challenges of FPS interlinking and the role of APIs,<span><a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p241015.htm#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>1</span></a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d223.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Linking fast payment systems across borders: governance and oversight</em></a>&nbsp;discusses design choices and the risk implications of these arrangements, sets out the key decisions for governance and outlines recommendations for their oversight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Promoting the harmonisation of application programming interfaces to enhance cross-border payments: recommendations and toolkit</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs are increasingly used throughout the global financial system for various payment functions, enhancing the efficiency of payment data exchange. However, API technical standards are currently fragmented, hindering the potential of APIs in cross-border payments and leading to increased time and expenses, as well as higher risks of errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d224.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">Promoting</span>&nbsp;the harmonisation of application programming interfaces to enhance cross-border payments: recommendations and toolkit</a></em>&nbsp;presents 10 recommendations directed at a broad array of stakeholders. The recommendations were formulated in collaboration with industry through a CPMI-led panel of experts to promote greater harmonisation of APIs in cross-border payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommendations do not propose a single universal API standard for cross-border payments, nor do they prescribe specific technologies or standards. Rather, they aim to steer API standards in a more harmonised direction by promoting facilitative processes, adoption of best practice design and international data standards, enhancements to the developer experience, and a focus on pre-validation APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPMI will continue its engagement with stakeholders to disseminate the findings of the two reports, facilitate their practical implementation and promote the interlinking of FPS for cross-border payments and harmonisation of APIs.&nbsp;</p>

<title>DTCC Announces Industry Sandbox To Support And Advance The Digital Asset Ecosystem - DTCC Also Announces Results Of Proof-Of-Concept To Optimize Collateral Management Using Tokenization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DTCC, digital assets, industry sandbox, collaboration, infrastructure <br />
Summary: DTCC launches a digital sandbox for industry collaboration and pilot projects to drive adoption of digital assets and create scalable solutions. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced DTCC Digital Launchpad, an industry sandbox intended to bring together financial market participants and clear the path to scalable adoption of digital assets. As an open ecosystem, DTCC Digital Launchpad will feature market participants, technology providers, and others working together to identify and collaborate on meaningful pilots that have a clear path to production.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DTCC Digital Launchpad will unify stakeholders from nearly every corner of the financial markets to solve the challenges facing adoption of digital asset technology,&rdquo; said Frank La Salla, DTCC President, CEO and Director. &ldquo;As an industry-owned and governed infrastructure for the world&rsquo;s largest capital markets, DTCC is uniquely suited to drive industry collaboration under the banner of a larger goal: building a digital asset ecosystem that&rsquo;s as safe and sound as the one we have for traditional securities today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Current estimates suggest tokenization presents a monumental business opportunity, with projections stating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gfma.org/policies-resources/gfma-publishes-report-on-impact-of-dlt-in-global-capital-markets" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$16 trillion dollars</span></a>&nbsp;in tokenized securities could be on digital rails by 2030. However, adoption of this technology has stalled as the industry continues working in silos. Most digital asset initiatives today have differing and conflicting standards, controls, and operational processes, leading to a fragmented digital landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached a critical inflection point in the adoption of digital asset technology, and DTCC is challenging the industry to rethink and reframe its siloed approach,&rdquo; said Nadine Chakar, Global Head of DTCC Digital Assets. &ldquo;The ultimate objective of DTCC Digital Launchpad is to bring the industry together to build production-ready, secure, and efficient digital market infrastructure and standards that will transform capital markets for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DTCC Digital Launchpad provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>DLT infrastructure featuring capabilities from the DTCC Digital Assets product suite. These capabilities help firms address some of the industry&rsquo;s biggest challenges around data, liquidity, and infrastructure, including interoperability and data harmonization</li>
<li>Robust and scalable infrastructure, enabling firms to get started on their digital asset journeys without having to build their own ecosystem</li>
<li>One platform, two objectives: 
<ul>
<li><span>Industry Launchpad:</span>&nbsp;An open ecosystem for broad collaboration. DTCC will publicize our prioritized pilots in Q1 2025, starting with an initial group of participants invited to co-develop these solutions. These initiatives are designed to unite the industry behind addressing critical pain points and paving the way for scalable solutions that drive industry-wide progress</li>
<li><span>Client Launchpad:</span>&nbsp;A dedicated space to leverage comprehensive digital asset capabilities from DTCC Digital Assets. Clients can explore and develop their own innovative use cases without substantial investment. DTCC&rsquo;s professional services team is on hand to offer guidance and provide product support to drive these initiatives to production</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DTCC today also announced the results of a recent proof-of-concept on DTCC Digital Launchpad. Led by Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC), clearinghouse of Japan Exchange Group, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/digital-assets/launchpad" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">proof-of-concept</span></a>&nbsp;explored how central counterparties (CCPs) could use tokenization to optimize the collateral management process for clearing members and their buy-side firms. In particular, it examined how margin calls and their associated processes could be automated, made more efficient and transparent for all participants using digital assets and smart contracts &ndash; or rules that automatically execute on a distributed ledger when certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JSCC is excited to share the results of our successful proof-of-concept, which demonstrated that digital assets and smart contracts technology could be leveraged to introduce operational and capital efficiencies for market participants in the collateral management process,&rdquo; said JSCC President &amp; CEO, Konuma Yasuyuki. &ldquo;By leveraging DTCC&rsquo;s reusable blockchain-based infrastructure, we were able to jump-start our proof-of-concept, easily issuing digital assets such as cash, stocks, and bonds without needing to develop our own infrastructure. This allowed us to shift our focus to the initiative&rsquo;s impact on our own business processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DTCC encourages the industry to read the results from JSCC, a key first step as the firm now invites the industry to explore how they can leverage DTCC Digital Launchpad to support large-scale initiatives in shared environments.</p>

With over two decades of innovation experience, business process optimization, and product development, Hurley is ideally positioned to guide Devexperts into its next phase of growth with a deep understanding of the company&rsquo;s skillsets, expertise, and customer base, and his own extensive experience of leadership.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Ben Hurley, CEO of Devexperts, said:<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&ldquo;We have evolved to the position of strategic partner with many major clients. Our relationships are now far more than just as a product company or a service provider: we work with clients to customize solutions that align with their needs as the industry continues to evolve. Whether through build, buy or hybrid approaches, we focus on connecting our users to financial market opportunities by providing best-in-class technology solutions, including advice from our deep insight into the capital markets sector.&rdquo;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Central to Hurley&rsquo;s vision for the future is enhancing Devexperts&rsquo; ability to provide seamless and efficient entry to capital markets for firms. He continues: &ldquo;We are committed to enabling widespread access to financial markets by expanding our technology offerings to brokers and financial institutions. Devexperts is already doing this, for example by offering fractional stock trading capability on our platforms that enables broader investor participation, and supporting mobile platforms and AI as practical tools for end users. We will continue to explore emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia, while also addressing the needs of mature markets, where we have a long-standing and established presence, such as the US and the UK.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Devexperts is dedicated to pushing innovation for its market data services and its full range of trading platforms, from SaaS solutions tailored for smaller brokerages, to infrastructure and in-house systems designed for large financial institutions. Devexperts&rsquo; solutions are highly customizable, support multi-asset trading, and include bespoke services to meet diverse needs across the industry.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Hurley added: &ldquo;Our founder and former CEO, Michael Babushkin, provided a solid foundation for Devexperts&rsquo; technology and practices, upon which we continue to build the innovative capabilities our clients have come to expect from us. Looking forward, we will continue to do this whilst also continuing to push the limits of innovation.&nbsp;With Michael&rsquo;s ongoing involvement, we are well-positioned to advance our mission and meet the evolving needs of our users.&rdquo;</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>As Hurley takes over from Babushkin, the transition ensures continuity, with Devexperts remaining focused on maintaining momentum, fine-tuning operations and laying a strong foundation for the future of the company. Babushkin&rsquo;s active engagement will support these efforts, ensuring the company continues to explore and seize new opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the PPAs?</span></p>
<p>PPAs are contractual arrangements between electricity producers (often renewable energy generators) and buyers. By providing renewable electricity at mutually agreed rates, these contracts foster stability for both parties and promote renewable energy sources (RES).</p>

Non-compliance will expose financial firms to an increased risk of cyber incidents, security breaches and system outages, as well as the potential for reputational damage and avoidable regulatory penalties,"</i>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Danny Green, Head of International Post-Trade Solutions, Broadridge</b><i>.&nbsp;"It is vital that firms are advancing their plans for the timely completion of both inhouse and third-party system reviews, and that they have a robust strategy to meet their prescribed recovery time objectives (RTOs) for their operating model."</i></p>
<p>Broadridge's operational resilience services and solutions for international post-trade processing enable firms to mutualize the cost of ensuring business continuity in the face of growing cyber-attacks, and of complying with DORA and other international operational resilience mandates through a shared services pricing model that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Deeply knowledgeable professional services:</b>&nbsp;Specialized expertise and advanced analytical tools to assess and validate firms' risk and control frameworks relating to internal and third-party systems and service provider data. It includes thorough evaluations of current frameworks to identify potential vulnerabilities, validation of risk controls and recommendations for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of operational risk management practices.</li>
<li><b>High-availability recovery:</b>&nbsp;The provision of back-up environments that are the regulatory-prescribed distance away from a firm's primary site, and that meet recovery time objectives within the required timeframe and to the required standard in the event of a cyber-attack or outage.&nbsp; Broadridge's enhanced solution can reduce recovery times from hours to minutes.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced recovery of entire system infrastructure:&nbsp;</b>An enhanced cyber-recovery capability that can prevent the compromise of critical data assets in as robust a manner as possible.&nbsp; By deploying secure, immutable storage, Broadridge can support unalterable, point-in-time copies of a firm's international post-trade infrastructure including the operating system, post-trade software and critical data. In the event of a cyber incident, these secure, cyber-resilient copies can be swiftly restored to enable faster and easier system recovery.</li>

<br />
Adaptive partnered with EDX to build EDX Clearing, a cloud-native central clearinghouse for institutional crypto trading, reducing settlement risk and transaction costs. The platform offers modern design and functionality, a user-friendly interface, and interoperability with third-party tools. This allows EDX to independently manage and control future innovations. 
<br /><br />Summary: 
Adaptive partnered with EDX to build a cloud-native central clearinghouse for institutional crypto trading, reducing settlement risk and transaction costs, and providing a modern design and functionality, user-friendly interface, and interoperability with third-party tools. This allows EDX to independently manage and control future innovations. <div>
<p>Adaptive, the experts in custom trading technology solutions, today announced it partnered with EDX Markets, a digital assets technology firm, to develop and deliver EDX Clearing (EDXC), EDX&rsquo;s proprietary, cloud-native central clearinghouse.</p>
<p>EDXC is an end-to-end clearinghouse for EDX&rsquo;s institutional crypto marketplace. Adaptive worked closely with EDX to design and build its unique clearinghouse system to support all-to-all trading on EDX&rsquo;s marketplace while reducing settlement risk exposure and providing a superior trading experience. EDXC helps to reduce transaction costs and risk for members by netting all trades and operating a once-a-day settlement cycle rather than settling multiple times throughout the trading day with multiple counterparties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In less than five months, Adaptive and EDX utilized their comprehensive digital asset domain expertise to build the new clearinghouse on Amazon Web Services&rsquo; (AWS) cloud, including UX/UI design, end-to-end development, delivery management and SRE. The platform ensures greater resilience and enables EDX to scale its clearing operations alongside market growth. Key features of the new clearinghouse include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Functionality:&nbsp;</b>An institutional grade clearing and settlement solution with unique features, including core book and risk management functions.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>User Experience:&nbsp;</b>A web-based clearing portal with an intuitive UI that provides reconciliation, reporting and administrative tools to EDX and its members.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Modern Design</b>: Complex functionality delivered through a modern architecture and technology stack running on AWS.</li>
<li><b>Interoperability:&nbsp;</b>Seamless integration with various third-party tools to respond quickly to emerging requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Matt Barrett, CEO of Adaptive said:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;Creating a bespoke cloud-based clearinghouse for a leading institutional crypto exchange is an important milestone for Adaptive. Working closely with EDX, we helped design and build a proprietary clearinghouse that allows the firm to take greater control of its technology, deliver enhanced benefits to clients and scale as the market evolves. The clearinghouse is an industry-leading achievement and showcases our team&rsquo;s efficiency and innovation &ndash; delivering a game-changing platform for a trailblazing digital assets business.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Tony Acu&ntilde;a-Rohter, CEO of EDX Clearing stated:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;With Adaptive's technical skills and deep understanding of digital asset trading, we were able to achieve an on-time and on-budget delivery of a cloud-based solution that sets new industry benchmarks. Our collaboration with Adaptive culminated in a state-of-the-art clearing system that redefines risk management and operational efficiency for institutional crypto markets, which has been pivotal in establishing EDX as a frontrunner in the new era of institutional crypto trading.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>With a central clearinghouse, EDX can independently manage and control the pace and focus of future innovations. Optimized for both simplicity and sophistication, EDX now offers a fully integrated marketplace and clearinghouse that addresses members' trading, clearing and settlement needs.</p>

<title>Spectrum Markets - Data Reveals: European Retail Investors Focus On Crude Oil Amid Middle East Tensions</title>

<div> SERIX data, bullish sentiment, crude oil, Spectrum Markets, retail investors <br />
Summary: Spectrum Markets' SERIX data shows bullish sentiment towards crude oil, driven by geopolitical tensions and supply concerns. Retail investor sentiment is positive. 36.9% of trades occurred outside traditional hours. <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Markets&rsquo; monthly SERIX data reveals a bullish sentiment towards both major crude oil indices last month, with WTI at 111 and Brent at 108</li>
<li>Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, along with supply concerns, have led to a steady increase in sentiment related to crude oil since June 2024</li>
<li>Spectrum saw 36.9% of trades in September 2024 take place outside traditional European market hours, reflecting ongoing demand for 24/5 trading</li>
</ul>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for September, revealing a positive shift towards both major crude oil indices: WTI and Brent, at 111 and 108 respectively.</p>
<p>What stands out in September is the steady continuation of the upward trend in crude oil SERIX sentiment that began in June 2024, coinciding with escalating tensions in the Middle East. This trend seems to be driven by geopolitical instability, fueling market anxiety about supply shortages and associated price increases.</p>
<p><b>Market opinion</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Retail investor sentiment is showing a clear upward trend in line with rising oil prices. Geopolitical instability in the Middle East has undoubtedly played a significant role, fuelling concerns about potential supply disruptions, which have been reflected in the bullish outlook for crude oil,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The steady rise in SERIX values for both WTI and Brent highlights a shift in sentiment, as investors look to oil as a key asset amid broader market uncertainties. With the energy market continuing to experience volatility, we expect this interest in crude oil to persist,&rdquo; Hall concludes.</p>
<p><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s September data</b></p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p>In September 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;242.4 million, with 36.9% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 78.1% on indices, 3.5% on currency pairs, 11.9% on commodities, 3.4% on equities and 3.1% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (27.8%), DAX 40 (24.8%), and DOW 30 (13.4%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the NASDAQ 100 shifted from neutral to a bullish 101, while both the DOW 30 and DAX 40 remained bearish at 98.</p>
<p><img alt="Spectrum_15Sep24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Spectrum_15Sep24.jpg" title="Spectrum_15Sep24" /></p>
<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded. (For a detailed methodology and examples, please visit this <a href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/the-venue/spectrum-european-retail-investor-index?utm_source=Press%20Release%20-%20EN&amp;utm_medium=SERIX%20LINK&amp;utm_campaign=May%20Volumes%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_content=">link</a>).</p>

<div> launch, ESG disclosure, Malaysia, SC, World Bank <br />
The joint SC-World Bank report on ESG disclosure in Malaysia recommends policy development, showcases good corporate disclosures, and highlights gaps. It aims to foster a sustainable capital market.<br /><br />Summary: The report analyzes ESG reporting practices in Malaysia, provides recommendations for policy development, highlights gaps in environmental indicators, and aims to strengthen ESG practices among domestic investors. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and the World Bank have launched a joint report, &ldquo;ESG Disclosure Assessment of Malaysia&rsquo;s Listed Companies and Recommendations for Policy Development&rdquo; at the SC-World Bank Conference 2024 today.</p>
<p>This report provides a baseline on ESG reporting practice in Malaysia, offering key insights for companies and investors to enhance sustainability reporting to align with international best practices and remain competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It aims to analyse the current state of ESG disclosure amongst listed companies and institutional investors, given the growing prominence of ESG and sustainability investments globally.</p>
<p>It also provides reflections and recommendations for policymakers in the Malaysian capital market to foster improved ESG reporting, ensuring relevance and consistency globally.</p>
<p>Speaking at the conference, SC Executive Director of Islamic Capital Market Sharifatul Hanizah Said Ali emphasised the importance of strengthening ESG disclosures amid growing global demand for sustainable investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This joint report reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering a more sustainable capital market. Improved ESG disclosure practices are expected to strengthen investor confidence and ensure that our market remains competitive and future-ready,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The report was based on an in-depth assessment, conducted between August and December 2023, examining ESG disclosure practices of a representative sample of 90 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, as well as processes among some of Malaysia's largest asset owners.</p>
<p>It highlights that most Malaysian listed companies had demonstrated good corporate disclosures and solid overall approach to managing governance and social issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the report also points out gaps in specific environmental indicators, especially those related to climate change and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Other findings from the report include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Larger companies<sup>1</sup> had significantly better ESG disclosure rates than smaller ones. </li>
<li>Regulatory compliance was the primary driver of corporate ESG reporting in Malaysia. </li>
<li>On ESG disclosure practices among four large Malaysian asset owners, the assessment indicated relatively low levels of ESG disclosure. However, interviews suggested greater efforts to strengthen ESG practices and processes other than currently publicly disclosed. </li>
</ol>
<p>The report concludes with a set of recommendations, including continuous monitoring along with consultations, to ensure effective implementation of the ESG disclosures in line with the recently launched National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other recommendations of the report include:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>To further support widespread implementation of Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s guidelines for sustainability reporting </li>
<li>To actively encourage development of ESG practices among domestic investors to increase appeal for corporate ESG disclosures </li>
</ol>
<p>This year marks the 5th installment of the SC-World Bank Conference, which was officiated by Deputy Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry YB Liew Chin Tong.</p>
<p>The conference explores synergies within the capital market and Islamic capital market to bridge funding gaps for micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) and mid-tier companies (MTCs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It aligns with the SC&rsquo;s 5-year Roadmap &ldquo;Catalysing MSME and MTC Access to the Capital Market (2024-2028)&rdquo;, which aims to support MSMEs and MTCs funding through the capital market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through our knowledge-based collaboration, we aim to support effective policy design and implementation to address the MSME and climate financing gaps, and I look forward to further leveraging the World Bank&rsquo;s global expertise to support the Malaysian government, financial regulators, and the private sector in developing a more robust and resilient financing ecosystem for MSMEs,&rdquo; said Dr. Zafer Mustafaoğlu, World Bank Country Director for the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam.</p>
<p>Over 200 industry players attended the conference, including entrepreneurs, government agencies, venture capital and private equity firms, RMOs, financial institutions, and Government-Linked Investment Companies.&nbsp;</p>

It was a pleasure to be a part of your annual dinner earlier this year, celebrating amazing personal and team achievements, and I&rsquo;m delighted to have the opportunity to be here to speak to you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you too, Michael, for those fascinating insights on the art of changing minds. This is incredibly useful, because some of what we strive to do as a regulator is exactly that, changing minds. Our engagement-led approach is about engaging with industry, nudging, guiding, steering, and sometimes directing, using all the soft and hard powers we have at our disposal. It&rsquo;s also about engaging and informing consumers as well, to try to encourage people to make thoughtful, good decisions as they save, invest and plan for their financial futures &ndash; so they understand their options and the opportunities and risks involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Capital Markets changes</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure many of you are aware, the future of regulation for New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets is currently being discussed across Government, industry and regulators. There are several meetings happening on a regular basis in preparation for a Ministerial decision on reforms. I know some of you in the room are heavily involved in that process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how is the FMA approaching this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re approaching it from the principle of being open with all our stakeholders, setting out our positions and the reasons for those. In several areas, we&rsquo;ve indicated strong comfort with making changes or supporting changes to make it easier for firms to raise capital, and where rules and regulations have been shown to be unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, as I have said before publicly, the FMA had provided the Minister with a list of rules and regulations which we feel are not needed, are a regulatory burden on firms, and sometimes aren&rsquo;t a good use of our resources, such as renewing exemptions every five years. This is an important part of our job &ndash; to keep the laws around financial markets under review. It is something we have been doing for a long-time and will continue to do so into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that this can never be a free for all, burning of the regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are fundamental investor protections that need to remain in place, and we will look to ensure those protections are retained and enhanced. For example, the work we have done and continue to do on the inappropriate use of the wholesale eligible investor regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These fundamental matters include protections for retail investors that were put in place following the global financial crisis and collapse of New Zealand&rsquo;s finance companies. We must not forget the harm caused to those investors and the detrimental impact on trust and confidence in our financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust in the financial sector is critical, and it is why scams have such a damaging impact. As I am sure you are all aware, they are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. The funds management sector is not immune. We are seeing a significant uptick in investment scams. All of us across the industry must be extra vigilant to safeguard investors from this risk. It is not going away, and prevention is key.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We consider scam detection and avoidance to be a vital component of a firm&rsquo;s operational resilience. The obligation to exercise professional care, diligence and skill in the best interests of investors extends to scams. I know a reassuringly large number of you take this very seriously, but I want to emphasise, all providers need to take this extremely seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Climate Related Disclosures</h3>
<p>There are also ongoing discussions on Climate Related Disclosures, including the standard setter, the XRB. Being one of the first countries in the world to introduce a CRD regime comes with inevitable challenges, as there isn&rsquo;t the luxury of learning from those who came before us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, with a large portion of entities now having published their first climate statements, it&rsquo;s understandable that we take a moment to look at how it&rsquo;s working. XRB recently published their consultation document on climate standards. I encourage you to provide your feedback by the end of this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do understand and appreciate there may be a desire for more detail on where we are at with all this work. Ultimately, these are policy matters and are decisions for the Government of the day. I look forward to talking more with you on this in the months ahead, after the appropriate announcements are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, our approach to this regime will continue to be - educative and constructive, seeking to support firms to successfully navigate in this new area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that there has been significant work across the industry to prepare and get ready for this regime, and our team have clearly seen that. Towards the end of next month, we&rsquo;ll be publishing a monitoring report setting out what we&rsquo;ve seen, both good and bad, to assist the sector. We&rsquo;ll be following this report up with some industry webinars and roundtables, as part of our engagement-led approach to take feedback and discuss the findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Liquidity Risk Management</h3>
<p>The theme of this conference, &lsquo;Adaptability,&rsquo; is perfectly timed for where we are today. From a regulator&rsquo;s perspective, adaptability does not just mean responding to change; it is about anticipating and preparing for it and looking to the horizon to see what is coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a kaitiaki of financial markets, we want to secure the outcome of everyone participating in market, well informed and with confidence. Our goal is to set clear expectations and guide market participants on what they need to do, particularly where there are risks of veering off the path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our updated liquidity risk management guidance, published in April this year, is a case in point.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remember how this guidance came about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2020, following significant market volatility in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we published a good practice guide on liquidity risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry self-assessed against this in August 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those industry responses disclosed some significant gaps between existing liquidity practices and acceptable practice, particularly around the frequency of stress testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, almost half of all the fund managers surveyed did not provide a date for their last liquidity stress test or said they could not remember the date. To be frank, this was simply not good enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is not going to be a regulator that sits back and waits for a significant liquidity failure, with the resulting harm for investors in that fund. You only have to look to the collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund in the UK in 2019 to see what happens there. Sitting back and simply waiting for harm to happen is not the FMA&rsquo;s preferred approach, and I&rsquo;d remind you, it&rsquo;s what the industry has always said it doesn&rsquo;t want its regulator to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having appropriate systems and controls to manage liquidity, enables investment in these types of assets. It means the frameworks and tools are in place to identify and manage the risks as and when they arise. In short, it&rsquo;s about being prepared to protect investors from foreseeable harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking all of this into account, particularly the short comings we observed in 2021, and cognisant of international regulatory standards, we consulted on and then published updated guidance in April. This guidance is deliberately principles-based, and capable of application to all funds, including and particularly those incorporating significant proportions of private assets and other less liquid assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is guidance that needs to be considered at the Board Level, as a matter of strategy and policy. It&rsquo;s not capable of sensibly being sent to legal, risk and compliance without that direction. This is because it is not prescriptive guidance. Purposely it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, Guidance should not simply be left to the legal or compliance departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the audience for any guidance we publish, are the senior strategy leaders within your organisations, so they can take a strategic view of what is needed. We are not looking for tick box compliance to our guidance, indeed, I am not sure, looking at the guidance, that that is possible &ndash; it is designed to guide firms to consider the important issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Green Bonds</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken previously about the views I bring to the table as a child of New Zealand in the 1980s, under an over-controlled economy with unrealistic controls on just about everything. I am not interested in regulation for the sake of it. I am interested in regulation as an intervention to support growth and the long-term prospects for New Zealanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is focused on regulation that genuinely matters and delivers for New Zealanders. It must meet the 'so what' test, ensuring it fosters beneficial innovation rather than stifling it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our work on green bonds is a notable example of this. The sector has told us that there can be a more efficient route to market for these bonds that reduces compliance costs and offers investors an additional non-financial benefit, further driving the development of this market. When we hear fair arguments like these, we will act. The aim is for this exemption to be in place early next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also continuing to engage with the FinTech community to understand how we can best enable the safe growth of this sector. The FMA has led the Council of Financial Regulators work on FinTech for a number of years now, acting as a gateway for firms. Most regulators overseas have looked at ways to encourage this sector, and we are talking to those regulators to understand what might work, and what doesn&rsquo;t for New Zealand. Domestically, we are meeting with Government and FinTech firms and working with the industry to best understand the hurdles and opportunities so we can get a practical understanding of what can be done here and the part we can play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is important for me to underline is that we understand that the financial landscape is evolving. Technological developments are rapidly reshaping innovation, and competition &ndash; with much potential for us here in New Zealand. It is important that the FMA is clear on the part we can play to support the safe nurturing of this potential.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FinTech</h3>
<p>At the FMA, we are committed to fostering innovation while ensuring that regulatory safeguards remain effective. By actively engaging with the industry and aligning with international standards, we aim to support the responsible adoption of these technologies, ensuring they deliver meaningful benefits to both investors and consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are eager to support solutions that challenge traditional investment models while ensuring fair, transparent and equitable outcomes for all market participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our recent engagement, there&rsquo;s also been a degree of focus on the exemptions we can issue. Lots of ideas have emerged, some of which could have us taking over from Parliament&rsquo;s job &ndash; running a coach and horses through primary legislation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to spend a moment on the box office topic of exemptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA can grant exemptions from compliance provisions to classes of persons or transactions, provided they align with the FMCA&rsquo;s legislation's intent and purpose. We can also grant one-off exemptions in relation to a particular offer if there are reasons the prescribed rules are not applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are rightly legislative safeguards which restrict the scope of exemptions that we can grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA should not and does not grant exemptions to reform the law or implement new policy changes. Exemptions must be targeted and appropriate to fall within the scope of our powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further safeguards include scrutiny at Parliament&rsquo;s regulation review committee and judicial review. So, while exemptions can provide flexibility in certain cases, they are not a mechanism for broad policy reform, and it is important that is widely understood. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We nonetheless welcome market participants to approach us early when considering whether a one-off exemption may apply so we can work through the options.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Economics Research</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we issued our latest piece of FMA research from our talented economics team. Established 18 months ago, the team is now ramping up, having published research on fairness in financial services and AI. After a series of industry roundtables to discuss the findings, the team&rsquo;s focus has now turned to commercial real estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercial real estate has long been a positive asset class due to its ability to provide both steady income and growth potential in a well-diversified portfolio. However, these investments, like all investments, come with risks. Since 2023, many overseas commercial real estate markets have been going through a downturn. In some cases, real estate funds have had to introduce redemption limits or withdrawal suspensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the situation, we held discussions about commercial real estate exposure with KiwiSaver managers and international regulators. We found that New Zealand investment managers are generally doing a good job in identifying and communicating risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have identified a couple of areas where some firms can enhance their risk management practices. Overall, however, there is minimal cause for concern. I encourage all of you to read the report. Like our guidance, this research is designed to help think about the issues &ndash; it is not a recipe for compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to close by coming full circle and touching back on the continuing discussions across Government and industry to support changes to capital markets. The FMA has been here before, contributing half of the funds to deliver the Capital Markets 2029 report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure to engage with people who are passionate and committed to the development of New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets, as I&rsquo;m sure all of us in this room are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is committed to tackling regulation where it is unnecessary, but also steadfast in its commitment to ensure appropriate and effective protections are in place for the mum and dad investors who were so severely burnt during the collapse of the finance companies. Getting this balance right is key, and I am certain we will get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time, and I would welcome any questions you may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Key words: Shadow Open Market Committee, monetary policy, inflation, labor market, policy rules <br />
Summary: The speaker discusses the economic outlook, the role of policy rules, and three potential scenarios that could affect monetary policy decisions. <div>
<p>Thank you, Athanasios, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of this very worthy celebration.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;In support of the theme of this conference, I do have some thoughts on the Shadow Open Market Committee's contributions to the policy debate, in particular its advocacy for policy rules. But before I get to that, I am going to exercise the keynote speaker's freedom to talk about whatever I want. To that end, I want to take a few minutes to offer my views on the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy. So let me start there, and afterward I will discuss the role that policy rules play in my decision making and in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>In the three weeks or so since the most recent FOMC meeting, data we have received has been uneven, as it sometimes has been over the past year. I continue to judge that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing, with employment near the FOMC's maximum employment objective and inflation in the vicinity of our target, even though the latest inflation data was disappointing.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first half of 2024, and I expect it to grow a bit faster in the third quarter. The Blue Chip consensus of private sector forecasters predicts 2.3 percent, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, based on up-to-the moment data, is predicting real growth of 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>Earlier, there were concerns that GDP in the first half of this year was overstating the strength of the economy, since gross domestic income (GDI) was estimated to have grown a mere 1.3 percent in the first half of this year, suggesting a big downward revision to GDP was coming. But revisions received after our most recent FOMC meeting showed the opposite&mdash;GDI growth was revised up substantially to 3.2 percent. This change in turn led to an upward revision in the personal saving rate of about 2 percentage points in the second quarter, leaving it at 5.2 percent in June. This revision suggests that household resources for future consumption are actually in good shape, although data and anecdotal evidence suggests lower-income groups are struggling. These revisions suggest that the economy is much stronger than previously thought, with little indication of a major slowdown in economic activity.</p>
<p>That outlook is supported by consumer spending that has been and continues to be strong. Though the growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has moderated since the second half of 2023, it has continued at an average pace of close to 2.5 percent so far this year. Also, my business contacts believe that there is considerable pent-up demand for durable goods, home improvements, and other big-ticket items, demand that built up due to high interest rates for credit cards and home equity loans. Now that rates have started to come down and are expected to come down more, consumers will be eager to make those purchases. For business spending, purchasing managers for manufacturers describe ongoing weakness in that sector, but those for the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing continue to report a solid expansion of activity.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the labor market. Only a couple months ago, it appeared that the labor market was cooling too quickly. Low numbers for job creation and a jump in the unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in July raised risks that the labor market was deteriorating. To remind you of how bad the markets viewed the July data, some Fed watchers were calling for an emergency FOMC meeting to discuss a rate cut. While the unemployment rate ticked down in August, job growth was once again well below expectations. Many were arguing that the labor market was on the verge of a serious deterioration and that the Fed was behind the curve even after a 50 basis point cut in the policy rate at the September FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Then we got the September employment report. Job creation in September was unexpectedly strong at 254,000 and the unemployment rate fell back down to 4.1 percent, which is where it was in June. The report also showed big upward revisions to payroll gains for the previous two months. Together, the message was loud and clear: While job creation has moderated and the unemployment rate has risen over the past year, the labor market remains quite healthy.</p>
<p>Along with other new data on the labor market, the evidence is that labor supply and demand have come into balance. The number of job vacancies, a sign of strength in the labor market, has fallen gradually since the beginning of the year. The ratio of vacancies to unemployed is at 1.2, about the level in 2019, which was a pretty strong labor market. To put this number into perspective, recent research has shown that this ratio has been above 1 only three times since 1960.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The quits rate, another sign of labor market strength, has fallen lower than it was in 2019, a decrease which partly reflects that the hiring rate has fallen as labor supply and demand have come into better balance.</p>
<p>In sum, based on payrolls, the unemployment rate and job revisions, there has been a very gradual moderation in labor demand relative to supply, but not a deterioration. The stability of the labor market, as reflected in these two measures as well as the other metrics I mentioned, bolsters my confidence that we can achieve further progress toward the FOMC's inflation goal while supporting a healthy labor market that adds jobs and boosts wages and living standards for workers.</p>
<p>I will be looking for more evidence to support this outlook in the weeks and months to come. But, unfortunately, it won't be easy to interpret the October jobs report to be released just before the next FOMC meeting. This report will most likely show a significant but temporary loss of jobs from the two recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. I expect these factors may reduce employment growth by more than 100,000 this month, and there may be a small effect on the unemployment rate, but I'm not sure it will be that visible. Since the jobs report will come during the usual blackout period for policymakers commenting on the economy, you won't have any of us trying to put this low reading into perspective, though I hope others will.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I expect payroll gains to moderate from their current pace but continue at a solid rate. The unemployment rate may drift a bit higher but is likely to remain quite low in historical terms. While I believe the labor market is on a solid footing, I will continue to watch the full range of data for signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inflation, after showing considerable progress for several months toward the FOMC's 2 percent target, likely moved up in September. The consumer price index grew 0.2 percent over the past month, 2.1 percent over the past three months, 1.6 percent over six months and 2.4 percent in the past year. Oil prices fell over most of the summer but then more recently have surged. Excluding energy and also food prices that likewise tend to be volatile, and just as it did in August, core CPI inflation printed at 0.3 percent in September and 3.3 percent over the past year.</p>
<p>Private-sector forecasts are predicting that PCE inflation, the FOMC's preferred measure, will also move up in September. Core PCE prices are expected to have risen around 0.25 percent last month. While not a welcome development, if the monthly core PCE inflation number comes in around this level, over the last 5 months it is still running very close to 2 percent on an annualized basis. We have made a lot of progress on inflation over the course of the last year and half, but that progress has clearly been uneven&mdash;at times it feels like being on a rollercoaster. Whether or not this month's inflation reading is just noise or if it signals ongoing increases, is yet to be seen. I will be watching the data carefully to see how persistent this recent uptick is.</p>
<p>The FOMC's inflation goal is an average of 2 percent over the longer run and there are some good reasons to think that price increases will be modest going forward. I am hearing reports from firms that their pricing power seems to have waned as consumers have become more sensitive to price changes. There has also been a steady slowing in the growth of labor compensation. It is true that average hourly earnings growth in September ticked up to 4 percent over the past year. And though it might seem like wage increases of 4 percent a year would put upward pressure on inflation that is near 2 percent, that might not be true if one considers productivity, which has grown at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent for the past five quarters. Some of this strength was making up for productivity that shrank due to the pandemic, but the longer it continues&mdash;up 2.5 percent for the second quarter&mdash;the better productivity supports wage growth of 4 percent, or even higher, without driving up inflation. All that said, I will be watching all the data related to inflation closely.</p>
<p>With the labor market in rough balance, employment near its maximum level, and inflation generally running close to our target over the past several months, I want to do what I can as a policymaker to keep the economy on this path. For me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the federal funds rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level. To help answer questions like this, I often look at various monetary policy rules to assess the appropriate setting of policy. Policy rules have long been of serious interest to the Shadow Open Market Committee. So before I turn to my views on the future path of policy, I thought I would talk about monetary policy rules versus discretion and begin with some background about the use of rules at the FOMC.</p>
<p>For a brief overview of the history of the advent of rules at the Board, I have been directed to the second chapter of&nbsp;<em>The Taylor Rule and the Transformation of Monetary Policy</em>&nbsp;written by George Kahn, and I have also consulted the memories of longtime members of the Board staff.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Rules came along in the 1990s as the Fed was moving away from monetary targeting, focusing more on interest-rate policy, and taking its first major steps toward increased transparency. There was immediate interest in Taylor-type rules among Fed staff, and even some contributions of research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;There was a presentation to the FOMC on rules in 1995, and that was the same year that John Taylor's Bay Area colleague, Janet Yellen, was apparently the first policymaker to mention the Taylor rule at an FOMC meeting. While FOMC decisions mimicked a Taylor rule much of the time under Chairman Alan Greenspan, he was famously an advocate of "constructive ambiguity" in communication, and he and other central bankers since have resisted the suggestion that decisions could be handed over to strict rules. Today, of course, a number of rules-based analyses are included in the material submitted to policymakers ahead of every FOMC meeting, and we publish the policy prescriptions of different rules as part of the Board's semi-annual&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>. Rules have become part of the furniture in modern policymaking.</p>
<p>As everyone here knows, but for the benefit of other listeners, Taylor rules relate the level of the policy interest rate to a limited number of other economic variables, most often including the deviation of inflation from a target value and a measure of resource use in the economy relative to some long-run trend.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;There are numerous forms of the Taylor rule, but they generally fall into two categories.</p>
<p>The first of these, an inertial rule, has the property that the policy rate changes only slowly over time. I tend to think of it as an approach that captures the reaction function of a policymaker in a stable economy where the forces that would tend to change the economy and policy build over time. When change does occur, a gradual response may give policymakers time to assess the true state of the economy and the possible effects of their decision. One example I can use is the steadfastness of policymakers in the latter part of 2023, when inflation fell more rapidly than was widely expected, and again in early 2024, when it briefly escalated. The FOMC did not change course either time, an approach validated by inertial rules.</p>
<p>A non-inertial rule, on the other hand, allows and in fact calls for relatively quick adjustments to policy. The guidance from these rules is more useful when there is a turning point in the economy, and policymakers need to stay ahead of events. One saw these non-inertial rules prescribe a sharper rise in the policy rate above the effective lower bound starting in 2021 as inflation began climbing above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Non-inertial rules are also more useful in the face of major shocks to the economy such as the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The great promise of rules is that they provide a simple and reliable guide to policy, but what should one do when different rules recommend different policy actions given the same economic conditions? Right now, inertial rules tell us to move slowly in reducing policy rates toward a neutral stance that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. On the other hand, non-inertial rules tell us to cut the policy rate more aggressively, subject to the caveat that one is certain of the values of all the 'star' variables: U*, Y* and r*. I think the answer is that while rules are valuable in helping analyze policy options, they have limitations. Among these are the limits of the data considered, which is typically narrower than the range of data that policymakers use to make decisions, and also the fact that simple policy rules do not take into account risk management, which is often a critical consideration in policy decisions. So, while policy rules serve as a good check on discretionary policy, there are times when discretion is needed. As a result, I prefer to think of them as "policy rules of thumb".</p>
<p>Turning to my view for the path for policy, let me discuss three scenarios that I have had in mind to manage the risks of upcoming decisions in the medium term.</p>
<p>The first scenario is one where the overall strong economic developments that I have described today continue, with inflation nearing the FOMC's target and the unemployment rate moving up only slightly. This scenario implies to me that we can proceed with moving policy toward a neutral stance at a deliberate pace. This path would be based on the judgment that the risks to both sides of our dual mandate are balanced. In this circumstance, our job is to keep inflation near 2 percent and not slow the economy unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Another scenario, less likely in light of recent data, is that inflation falls materially below 2 percent for some time, and/or the labor market significantly deteriorates. The message here is that demand is falling, the FOMC may suddenly be behind the curve, and that message would argue for moving to neutral more quickly by front-loading cuts to the policy rate.</p>
<p>The third scenario applies if inflation unexpectedly escalates either because of stronger-than-expected consumer demand or wage pressure, or because of some shock to supply that pushes up inflation. As we learned in the recovery from the pandemic recession, when demand was stronger and supply weaker than initially expected, such surprises do occur. In this circumstance, as long as the labor market isn't deteriorating, we can pause rate cuts until progress resumes and uncertainty diminishes.</p>
<p>Most recently, we have seen upward revisions to GDI, an increase in job vacancies, high GDP growth forecasts, a strong jobs report and a hotter than expected CPI report. This data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired. While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting. I will be watching to see whether data, due out before our next meeting, on inflation, the labor market and economic activity confirms or undercuts my inclination to be more cautious about loosening monetary policy.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the near term, my baseline still calls for reducing the policy rate gradually over the next year. The median rate for FOMC participants at the end of 2025 is 3.4 percent, so most of my colleagues likewise expect to reduce policy over the next year. There is less certainty about the final destination. The median estimated longer-run level of the federal funds rate in the Committee's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is 2.9 percent, but with quite a wide dispersion, ranging from 2.4 percent to 3.8 percent. While much attention is given to the size of cuts over the next meeting or two, I think the larger message of the SEP is that there is a considerable extent of policy accommodation to remove, and if the economy continues in its current sweet spot, this will happen gradually.</p>
<p>Thank you again, for the opportunity to be part of today's conference, and for allowing me to share some thoughts, relevant to monetary policy rules and my day job back in Washington. The Shadow Committee has elevated the public debate about monetary policy. May you continue to play that role for many years to come.</p>

<div> Observatory, ELITE Day, impact, growth, expansion
<br />
ELITE Day 2024 focuses on purpose-driven companies. ELITE Impact Observatory measures financial and employment impact. ELITE expands in Europe.
<br /><br />Summary: ELITE Day 2024 highlights purpose-driven companies. ELITE Impact Observatory measures financial and employment impact. ELITE expands in Europe. <div>
<ul>
<li>
<h5><span>Today, ELITE hosts the 5<span>th</span>&nbsp;edition of its strategic Think Tank ELITE Day &ldquo;Purpose-driven companies: lead the future with impact&rdquo; with 350+ international C-Level representatives of ELITE network companies, partners and investors</span></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><span>Launch of the first ELITE Impact Observatory, a unique research measuring the impact of ELITE, in terms of financial performance and employment, on the companies belonging to the network</span></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><span>Over 2,300 companies and 200 partners in Europe are part of the ELITE network</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText1">ELITE, the Euronext ecosystem supporting privately-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their sustainable long-term growth, today launches the ELITE Impact Observatory on the occasion of ELITE Day 2024. The analysis measures the impact of ELITE in terms of financial performance and employment for the companies within the network.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The research is based on a sample of 500 ELITE companies, representative of the main sectors in ELITE and selected based on their specific ATECO code. The selected companies have a turnover of between &euro;10 million and &euro;300 million. The ELITE sample was then compared with a benchmark sample of around 1,200 companies. The benchmark sample was defined using a statistical approach based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>built according to financial parameters and ATECO code in line with the ELITE sample;</li>
<li>structured to maintain, in percentage terms, the weight of each geographic area within the ELITE sample;</li>
<li>numerically larger than the ELITE sample.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText1">The analysis, covering the period from 2019 to 2022, observed trends in revenues, EBITDA, and employment. These three variables are significant for assessing company growth in terms of size, margins, and the ability to create jobs, and therefore also impact employment.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In terms of revenues, the ELITE sample recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of +11.8% over the four years analysed, compared to a CAGR of +7.8% for the benchmark sample. Looking at absolute values, from 2019 to 2022, the ELITE sample saw a 52.2% greater average revenue growth than the benchmark sample.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Regarding margins, the ELITE sample recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of EBITDA of +17.1% over the four years, compared to a CAGR of +12.4% for the benchmark sample. In absolute terms, from 2019 to 2022, the ELITE sample recorded 37% higher average EBITDA growth compared to the benchmark sample.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In terms of employment, the ELITE sample recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of +15.5% in the number of employees, compared to +0.8% for the benchmark sample. In absolute terms, from 2019 to 2022, the ELITE sample saw an average employee growth rate of 1,825% higher than that of the benchmark sample.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The analysis results clearly indicate how ELITE's typical managerial, governance, planning and financial tools create a highly positive impact on the already virtuous and forward-thinking companies that are selected to join this ecosystem, which is dedicated to the sustainable growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><span>ELITE Day &ndash; Purpose-driven companies: lead the future with impact</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">The fifth edition of ELITE Day, held today in Milan at Borsa Italiana&rsquo;s premises in Palazzo Mezzanotte, aims to analyse how companies driven by a clear and shared purpose are not only transforming their sectors but also shaping the future by creating a broader, significant and lasting impact.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The event, supported by the United Nations Global Compact Network Italy (UNGCN Italy), includes debates, interviews, in-depth panels, and opportunities for discussions between entrepreneurs, top managers, investors, and advisors in the ELITE network. It provides a platform to explore the priorities of virtuous companies, drawing inspiration from CEOs and business leaders who align their growth objectives with tangible and lasting impact for customers, employees and all stakeholders.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">ELITE Day reaffirms itself as a strategic Think Tank attracting a European audience of over 350 C-Level representatives from companies, partners, and investors in the network, exposed to renowned speakers and testimonials. These include Eric de Montgolfier, CEO of Invest Europe; Federico Grom, Serial Entrepreneur; Eleonora Briolini, Board Member and Head of Tax at BDO Italy; C&eacute;dric Lowenbach, Development Director at Bpifrance; Tommaso Paoli, CEO of NUO; Jorge Portugal, General Manager of COTEC; Marco Frey, President of United Nations Global Compact Italy; Emanuele Preve, Shareholder CFO &amp; Board Member of Riso Gallo; Marie-Claire Daveu, Chief Sustainability Officer and Institutional Affairs of Kering; Andrea D'Onofrio, Head of Data &amp; AI Western Europe Microsoft; Pasquale Gravina, Leadership &amp; Training Advisor.<br /><br /><a href="https://admin.eventdrive.com/public/events/64520/website/home/0/0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>View the ELITE Day programme</span></a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><span>ELITE&rsquo;s numbers and European expansion:</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Since ELITE&rsquo;s launch, more than 2,300 companies have joined the network, with an aggregate turnover of over &euro;189 billion, representing 42 sectors and employing over 660,000 people.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">ELITE is a success story in providing concrete support to many private companies in accelerating their growth: over 260 companies have raised &euro;947 million with ELITE&rsquo;s direct support, leveraging the Basket Bond<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;model; 73 companies have listed, raising &euro;4 billion; 180 companies have issued over 300 corporate bonds raising &euro;3.6 billion; and around 600 companies have invested in inorganic growth through over 1,800 M&amp;A operations.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Since joining Euronext in 2021, ELITE has been closely aligned with the Group&rsquo;s strategy to promote European capital markets and support private companies in financing their long-term growth. Currently, the focus is on expanding ELITE into other Euronext geographies.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In the Netherlands, in 2022, ELITE and Euronext Amsterdam won participation in the "One Single Hub" promoted by RVO, the Dutch government agency for enterprises under the Ministry of Economic Development, and launched a multi-year programme focused on aggregating and enhancing successful initiatives in collaboration with local stakeholders, while introducing a growth programme for successful SMEs.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In July 2023, ELITE officially launched in Portugal with an initial group of Portuguese companies joining the programme, now consisting of 25 of the country&rsquo;s most promising companies.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Other European expansion initiatives include the Italy-France Accelerator, launched in 2021 and followed by a second edition in 2023, the first joint programme between France and Italy to drive the growth of companies in these two markets. In early October 2024, ELITE welcomed its first group of companies in France, marking a significant milestone in the development of its network.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">More than 100 companies have joined ELITE since the beginning of 2024, including companies in Italy, as well as those set to begin their journey within the pan-European programme on Tuesday 15 October 2024, which covers growing companies from all over Europe, including Italy, France, Portugal and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Marta Testi, CEO of ELITE, commented:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our purpose serves as the compass guiding every decision and action we take. We firmly believe that connecting businesses and capital is essential for creating sustainable, long-term value. Our goal is to support companies in their growth journey, helping them become stronger, more competitive, and resilient in the global landscape. The ELITE Impact Observatory clearly demonstrates how companies in our ecosystem have experienced significant growth in terms of size, margins and their ability to create jobs. These results, along with the pan-European expansion of ELITE through its integration into the Euronext Group, confirm the key role ELITE plays in accelerating companies' access to the capital and expertise needed for growth.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> appointment, Chairman, SFC, Dr Wong, Mr Lui
Summary:<br />
Dr Kelvin Wong Tin-yau appointed as SFC Chairman, succeeding Tim Lui. Lui lauds Wong’s experience. Wong looks forward to upholding market integrity.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) welcomes the appointment by the Chief Executive of Dr Kelvin Wong Tin-yau as the Chairman of the SFC for a term of three years from 20 October 2024 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Dr Wong will succeed Mr Tim Lui who will step down on 19 October 2024 having chaired the SFC for six years (Note 2).</p>
<p>Welcoming Dr Wong&rsquo;s appointment, Mr Lui said: &ldquo;Kelvin has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development and regulation of capital markets, in particular, being Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council, which the SFC works closely with to uphold the quality and maintain the integrity of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets and its reputation as an international financial centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having previously been a Non-Executive Director of the SFC and Chairman of the then Investor Education Centre, Kelvin is well-versed in the Commission&rsquo;s policy objectives, its strategic priorities and its operation. I am certain the SFC will continue to benefit hugely from his vast experience in furthering the SFC&rsquo;s core mission to uphold the quality and integrity of Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial markets,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his six-year tenure, Mr Lui said his time at the SFC has been challenging, yet memorable. &ldquo;It has been my honour to be part of the SFC&rsquo;s 35-year inspiring journey working with the Board, senior executives and all SFC colleagues to weather through the immense challenges that Hong Kong and its financial markets faced during the last six years, amongst them, the impact brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions amidst the evolving global economic landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collective efforts have enabled the SFC to ride out the difficult times and continued to make headway in many fronts including enhancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s global competitiveness and interconnectivity with the Mainland markets; upholding market integrity and maintaining its resilience; leading market transformation through technology and ESG, as well as mitigating harm to our markets to safeguard the interest of investors,&rdquo; Mr Lui added.</p>

I look forward to working cohesively with the Board, CEO Julia, and the management team, many of whom I closely partnered with in my previous role as a Non-Executive Director. It is a great moment for the SFC that we must embrace the opportunities and challenges to foster a sustainable and vibrant capital market that not only protects investors&rsquo; interest but also promotes economic growth, advances corporate governance and spurs innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, Ms Julia Leung, said: &ldquo;I would like to extend a warm welcome to Kelvin and express my deep gratitude to Tim for his exemplary leadership and invaluable guidance in steering the SFC through the many difficult challenges while continuing our mission in pursuing market integrity, transparency and resilience. We now have a set of&nbsp;very clear strategic priorities which would enable the SFC to continue its firm commitment in safeguarding the integrity of our markets and continuing to foster market development.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of the SFC, I wish Tim all the very best and I look forward to continuing working closely with the Board under the leadership of the new Chairman to carry out our regulatory objectives and further strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as an international financial centre,&rdquo; Ms Leung added.</p>

<div> standard, vLEI, GLEIF, ISO, authentication <br />
Summary: ISO expands LEI standard to include verifiable LEIs for secure, digital verification of legal entities, pioneering decentralized authentication. GLEIF leads standardization effort.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">ISO has expanded the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) technical standard&mdash;ISO 17442&mdash;to describe a standard approach for embedding the LEI in digitally signed, tamper-resistant verifiable credentials, known as verifiable LEIs (vLEIs).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The publication of&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC0wQXSLG7ubyZJwuiqG2yCZRPzkc28sopyzm06B-2FQHCTBYbm_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgopkqlx8cS0FFNxZUe51piZ6n6okyeDMJdkH51q5lbJ1CbKrK-2FN9A2-2FZ3E0Qhk1jsCvnSIougtAdmFq1VzyVxoyhKR1PwyiOsbcgAZA0n50opmJ2o1PecoJvCUfp8zRejnUGhZ2VGDA5-2BPLgtp7RNOBoE0c9-2BIpbImPJGqGOaLyuULUWFLr1piy1-2FAsKv8G3Hyo8-2Blo5OIRQzdLoONJvU6oOTNV777LHkd9gVLMB-2FgR9Z6tnwwdUp-2BCZPARIwGJxaliAs7RRHsrZLjmWo-2FC62wpyRbvn4HxU9NKHRoKJMa1wA-3D-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ISO 17442-3:2024</a>&nbsp;standardizes the vLEI&mdash;a new form of digitized organizational identity pioneered by GLEIF which answers the global need for the decentralized, automated authentication and verification of legal entities across various industries.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The standard describes different types of vLEI credentials developed using the chaining capabilities of Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) credentials. This chaining, combined with the secure capabilities of the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol for the issuance and revocation of credentials and the pre-rotation of cryptographic keys, allows for the provenance of vLEIs to be traced back to GLEIF as the 'root of trust' for the vLEI trust chain, as well as the organization's LEI in the Global LEI System, which is operated by GLEIF under regulatory oversight.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Notably, the standard describes the use of the vLEI to verify the identity of people that represent an organization in either official or functional roles, both inside and outside the boundaries of the organization. This marks an important step forward in establishing the vLEI as a universally trusted method of digitally verifying the authenticity of persons authorized to act on behalf of an organization, which is a key requirement for sensitive business transactions and other official interactions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "This is a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital organizational identity. The inclusion of the vLEI in ISO 17442 solidifies its role as the global benchmark for secure, digital verification of legal entities. As the vLEI gains traction, it promises to revolutionize how businesses authenticate and trust each other, enabling seamless interactions in a way that has never been possible before. The vLEI not only enhances security and trust but also drives efficiency and scalability across platforms and industries."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The proposal for standardizing the vLEI was brought to ISO by GLEIF. The organization also participated in work efforts for the revision through its membership of the technical committee which manages ISO 17442 (ISO/TC 68 SC 8).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Jim Northey, ISO TC 68 Chair and Non-Executive Director, the FIX Trading Community, adds: "ISO TC68 community would like to thank the work of GLEIF in conjunction with ISO TC 68/SC 8 in their innovative approach to provide secure credentials capable of identifying a legal entity and associated role associated with the legal entity&nbsp;which provides a global standard approach for not only managing identity in regulatory reporting but also commerce in general. Having this open globally supported standard for securely identifying counterparties provides a significant improvement in infrastructure that further increases the value of our global legal identifier system."</span></span></span></p>

<div> Partnership, RegTech, Sanctions screening, Swift, Financial institutions
Summary: GSS and Swift extend partnership for sanctions screening, reducing inefficiencies, false positives, and implementation time. Collaboration aims for industry-wide frictionless payments.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global Screening Services (GSS),</span>&nbsp;a leading RegTech pioneer, today announced an extended partnership with Swift that will enable financial institutions around the world to access its unique end&shy; to-end sanctions screening platform over the same infrastructure that they already trust to move money between more than 200 countries and four billion accounts globally.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The collaboration progresses a strategic relationship the two organisations announced in October 2022, and reflects a commitment by Swift, GSS and the GSS Advisory Board, comprising 35 of the world's leading financial institutions, to reduce inefficiency in the global payments ecosystem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>More than 40 billion cross-border transactions are screened each year for sanctions compliance, often multiple times to meet different regulatory requirements across the jurisdictions through which money flows. Almost 99% of those flagged for further investigation turn out to be false positives, creating extra costs and delays. GSS aims to address this challenge, providing a cloud-based, standardised and centralised screening service to eliminate unnecessary screening repetition, frequency of false positives and time to investigate. Enabling connectivity via Swift's secure and resilient network, and standard API solution, adds to the efficiency and significantly reduces the time for financial institutions to implement the GSS utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Tom Scampion, CEO and Co-founder of GSS, said:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;GSS&nbsp;</i>is committed to improving regulatory compliance and delivering an enhanced customer experience, which our agreement with Swift puts us in a perfect place to provide. We're thrilled to be collaborating with a trusted and secure global platform and are looking forward to our customers unlocking the new benefits on offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Ultimately, our principal focus is to reduce friction and streamline cross-border payments, so working with Swift will help us take this goal to the next level by guaranteeing the protection of end-to-end screened transactions."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Thierry Chilosi, Chief Business Officer at Swift, added: "</b>lndustry-wide collaboration is vital if we're to remove friction from the cross-border payments ecosystem and achieve our collective goals. Working with GSS will enable our community to streamline their sanctions screening processes using their existing Swift connectivity, with GSS' services complementing our own existing capabilities which are helping drive the industry towards an instant and frictionless future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">"Beyond enabling access to GSS via the Swift network, the agreement also encompasses ongoing collaboration on the development of screening standards, enhancing the effectiveness of sanctions compliance testing, and supporting institutional performance benchmarking."</div>

Summary:<br /><br />MAS maintained S$NEER rate, anticipating sustained growth. Global economy resilient but China's domestic spending weak. Tech-related activities boost regional economies. Singapore's Q3 growth stronger than expected, supported by electronics and modern services. MAS expects GDP growth at upper end of 2-3% forecast range for 2024. Core inflation expected to remain contained, monetary policy settings consistent with medium-term price stability. <div>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>In the July 2024 Monetary Policy Statement, MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or the level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has been appreciating gradually in line with the policy band</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Chart 1</span><span><br />S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (S$NEER)</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mps_chart_2024_10.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The global economy</span><span>&nbsp;has remained broadly resilient.&nbsp;</span><span>Growth has been steady in the US, sustained by domestic demand, but has been weaker in the Euro area. In China, exports were buoyant in the first half of 2024, but domestic spending continued to be subdued amid the housing market downturn.&nbsp;</span><span>Regional economies</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>meanwhile have benefitted from</span><span>&nbsp;the sustained upturn in the global electronics cycle, with investments supported by tech-related activities.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners are expected to stay on a steady expansion path in the quarters ahead. Final demand will be underpinned by further declines in interest rates as inflation moderates worldwide. Recent policy interventions should also help stabilise near-term growth in China.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to M<span>TI&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><em>Advance Estimat</em><span>es, the Singapore economy expanded by 2.1% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in Q3, accelerating from the average of 0.4% in the first half of the year. Growth momentum was stronger than expected, and was largely underpinned by a step-up in manufacturing output, particularly in the electronics industry. Activity also picked up in the modern services cluster.</span></span></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>For the rest of 2024, Singapore&rsquo;s growth should be sustained by the ongoing upswing in the electronics and trade cycles as well as the easing in global financial conditions. For the year as a whole,&nbsp;</span><span>MAS expects GDP growth to come in around the upper end of the 2&ndash;3% forecast range. The negative output gap is projected to close in H2 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next year, the Singapore economy is currently forecast to expand at close to its potential rate. However, there is significant uncertainty around the economic outlook, reflecting continuing risks in the external environment. A sharp escalation in geopolitical and trade conflicts could exert sizeable drags on global and domestic investment and trade. There is also uncertainty around the pace and impact of global macroeconomic policy easing, and with it, the durability of the electronics upturn.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation</span><span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-14oct24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;<span>stepped down to 2.6% y-o-y in Jul&ndash;Aug, from 3.0% in Q2, as consumer price increases fell across a broad range of goods and services. Excluding the impact of the GST hikes, core inflation is estimated to have edged below 2.0% in Jul&ndash;Aug.&nbsp;The seasonally adjusted three-month/three-month&nbsp;<span>rate<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-14oct24#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;of core inflation also declined to an annualised rate of 0.9% in August, reflecting a slower pace of price increases in food services, including hawker food, as well as a range of retail and household durable goods.</span></span></p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Core inflation momentum is expected to remain contained in Q4, which would imply a further slowing in its y-o-y rate over the next few months. Core inflation should end the year around 2%, and average between 2.5%</span><span>&ndash;</span><span>3.0% for 2024 as a whole, down from 4.2% in 2023. CPI-All Items inflation fell to 2.3% y-o-y in Jul&ndash;Aug and should come in around 2.5% this year, compared to 4.8% in 2023.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid&nbsp;</span><span>moderate underlying cost pressures, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average around the mid-point of the forecast range of 1.5&ndash;2.5% in 2025. Imported costs are forecast to be broadly stable next year, reflecting an anticipated unwinding of oil production cuts and favourable weather conditions for food supply. CPI inflation in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners should also largely be in line with pre-pandemic norms. On the domestic front,&nbsp;</span><span>unit labour costs are projected to rise more gradually, alongside moderating nominal wage growth as well as a recovery in productivity.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation is forecast to average 1.5&ndash;2.5% as well in 2025. Accommodation inflation should slow as leasing demand falls, partly offsetting an anticipated pickup in private transport inflation amid still-firm car purchases.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The risks to Singapore&rsquo;s inflation outlook are more balanced compared to three months ago. If there is stronger-than-anticipated demand for labour due to upsides in GDP growth, it may take longer for unit labour cost growth to moderate and consequently for services price inflation to normalise. An intensification of geopolitical tensions and commodity price shocks could add to imported costs. However, a significant downturn in the global economy would induce an abrupt easing in cost and price pressures, causing domestic inflation to come in materially lower than expected.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s growth momentum has picked up and the negative output gap&nbsp;</span><span>is projected to close in H2 2024</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Barring a weakening in global final demand, the economy should continue to expand at a steady pace and keep close to its potential path in 2025.&nbsp;</span><span>MAS Core Inflation has stepped down but is anticipated to decline further to around 2% by the end of 2024.</span></p>

<div> ASX, World Investor Week, financial literacy, ASX sharemarket game, investor education
<br />
ASX joined World Investor Week to promote financial literacy. NSW Treasurer and ASX CEO ring the bell in support. ASX sharemarket game winners announced.
<br /><br />Summary: 
ASX supports World Investor Week. NSW Treasurer and ASX CEO promote financial literacy. ASX sharemarket game winners announced. <div>
<p>ASX today joined over 60 other exchanges globally in ringing the bell for financial literacy in support of World Investor Week. This annual event, led by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), aims to promote investor education and protection by empowering investors with the tools and knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSW Treasurer, the Hon Daniel Mookhey MLC joined ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse and schools from across NSW to ring the bell for financial literacy at ASX headquarters in Sydney.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>NSW Treasurer, the Hon Daniel Mookhey said:</b> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to be highlighting the importance of financial literacy at the ASX&rsquo;s ring the bell for financial literacy event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial literacy is essential in empowering people to make informed decisions about their money, investments and futures. By promoting education and awareness, we can help more people navigate the complexities of the financial world with confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NSW Government is committed to supporting initiatives that enhance financial literacy. We believe that everyone, regardless of their background, should have access to the knowledge and tools needed to make sound financial decisions that will benefit them and their families in the long term. I commend ASX for their focus on investor education and congratulate all the winners of the ASX sharemarket game.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>ASX Managing Director and CEO, Helen Lofthouse,</b> said: &ldquo;World Investor Week unites securities regulators and exchanges, and other financial institutions globally to raise awareness on the importance of financial literacy and informed investing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ASX plays an important role in promoting these objectives, and this event aligns with our intent to enhance financial literacy and empower investors to make sound investment decisions for their future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ASX has run its flagship sharemarket game for more than 45 years and we remain committed to this program which promotes investor education in a practical and fun way. Participants are given a hypothetical $50,000 to invest and, based on the returns made, the winners for the 2024 game are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1<sup>st</sup> &ndash; John Redgrave&nbsp; </li>
<li>2<sup>nd</sup> &ndash; Paul Gabrielides </li>
<li>3<sup>rd</sup> &ndash; Stuart Vaughan</li>
</ul>
<p>All three winners shared similar characteristics in terms of patience and temperament; they were able to ride out the volatility, including choosing the right time to sell.</p>
<p>In taking out first place with a portfolio value of slightly more than $67,000, John&rsquo;s advice for other players is to lose your fear of selling. His &lsquo;winning move&rsquo; was to sell and repurchase after a major geopolitical event: &ldquo;I was surprised the stock markets didn&rsquo;t fall straight away so I decided to sell all stocks at a good price. The falls in the next week were extensive and I then rebought after the falling finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the noise and doing your homework was the key takeaway for all three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to congratulate this year&rsquo;s sharemarket game winners and thank everyone that took part,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said. &ldquo;Financial literacy is the foundation of good investing and ASX is committed to providing investors with the knowledge and tools they need to build confidence in their investment decisions and to navigate both opportunities and risks in the marketplace.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>NZX Updates FY2024 Earnings Guidance</title>

<div> raised, guidance, earnings, capital, trading
Summary:
NZX Limited raised FY2024 operating earnings guidance by 10% due to strong capital raisings, increased trading, and ongoing growth in funds under management and administration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>NZX Limited has today updated its full-year operating earnings1 guidance following strong performance across all business lines.  NZX has raised the FY2024 guidance range from $40.0-$44.5 million to $45.0-$49.0 million (normalised to exclude integration and restructuring costs). This represents a move of approximately 10% between the midpoint of the ranges.  The revision is primarily due to stronger-than-expected levels of large capital raisings in September 2024, which have fed into increased trading and clearing activity. In addition, both Smart &ndash; formally known as Smartshares &ndash; and NZX Wealth Technologies, are benefitting from ongoing growth in funds under management and funds under administration respectively.  The guidance is subject to market outcomes, particularly with respect to market capitalisation, total capital listed and raised, secondary market value and derivatives volumes traded, funds under management and administration growth and technology costs.  Additionally, this guidance assumes there is no material decline in the macro-economic environment and/or market conditions, and there are no significant one-off expenses, major accounting adjustments, other unforeseeable circumstances, or future acquisitions or divestments. </span></p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Publishes Research On Commercial Real Estate And The KiwiSaver Industry</title>

<div> KiwiSaver, FMA, commercial real estate, fund managers, risk management
Summary:<br />
- FMA found most KiwiSaver providers manage commercial real estate exposure well.
- Commercial real estate showed signs of stress globally due to COVID-19.
-  FMA research found good risk management practices among New Zealand fund managers.
- Some areas identified for enhancement include liquidity risk management.
- FMA emphasizes the importance of understanding and managing risks properly.<br /> <div>
<p>Research from the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has found most KiwiSaver providers are well placed to manage their exposure to the commercial real estate market but more work can be done to mitigate and communicate the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercial real estate has become an important alternative asset class for fund managers, and was previously seen as a relatively low-risk investment option within a diversified portfolio.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year commercial real estate started to show signs of stress globally &ndash; increased interest rates and changes in usage patterns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially around second-tier office buildings and retail investments, were driving down valuations. By the start of 2024, transaction volumes had decreased, causing some overseas real estate funds to limit or suspend redemptions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, the FMA undertook research to increase our understanding of the exposure of New Zealand KiwiSaver providers to commercial real estate in order to better understand the risks faced by New Zealand investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA engaged with 10 fund managers about their commercial real estate investments, including both default and non-default funds and funds of different sizes. Based on the information that fund managers provided, most have good practices in place to identify and manage the risks across their commercial real estate positions.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Chief Economist, Stuart Johnson, said: &ldquo;What we found in this research was largely reassuring &ndash; most New Zealand fund managers have been taking a pretty conservative approach to this sector &ndash; in many cases they&rsquo;re underweight against their own targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most cases the risk to New Zealand investors seems to be recognised and reasonably moderate.  Most funds appear to have good practices in place to identify and manage the risks associated with commercial real estate.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The research did, however, find some areas where firms can enhance their risk management practices, said Johnson. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These include an overreliance on the listed nature of commercial real estate assets for managing liquidity risk. We think some managers might have underestimated the level of liquidity risk associated with both their unlisted and listed commercial real estate assets under the current market conditions. We are also concerned about firms assuming a high degree of liquidity simply because an investment is listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commercial real estate has long been a positive asset class due to its ability to provide both steady income and growth potential. Over recent decades, it has become an increasingly important part of a well-diversified portfolio. But these investments, like all investments, come with risks,&rdquo; said Johnson.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are saying here that it&rsquo;s important that fund managers understand and manage these risks properly.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

Summary:<br /><br />NGX Group and SEC organized events to promote financial literacy, technology, and sustainability. Leaders emphasized investor protection and technology-driven innovation. <div>
<p>As part of the global IOSCO World Investor Week, which took place from October 7-13, 2024, Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), in collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other market operators, organized a series of engaging events aimed at promoting financial literacy and empowering retail investors. These activities highlighted the growing importance of technology and sustainability in modern finance, aligning with the 2024 theme: &ldquo;Technology, Digital Finance, and Sustainable Finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The week kicked-off with a financial literacy seminar at Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, hosted by NGX Group and the Financial Literacy Technical Committee of SEC.

<p>Following the seminar, the NGX Retail Investor Clinic provided practical insights into capital market strategies from industry experts. The week&rsquo;s events culminated in the symbolic &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy&rdquo;, leveraging the NGX Closing Gong Ceremony to emphasize the ongoing efforts to educate and empower retail investors. Over 200 participants, including representatives from institutions like the Nigerian Higher Education Foundation, the University of Lagos, and GFA Technologies, attended.</p>
<p>Dr. Emomotimi Agama, Director-General of SEC, highlighted the importance of investor protection and regulatory oversight in fostering trust. &ldquo;Our mission is to safeguard investor interests while promoting informed participation,&rdquo; he emphasized.</p>
<p>Temi Popoola, GMD/CEO of NGX Group, speaking on behalf of Alhaji Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman of NGX Group, stressed the Group&rsquo;s leadership in using technology to drive sustainable finance and innovation. Jude Chiemeka, CEO of NGX, reiterated the importance of investor education, stating, &ldquo;By equipping individuals with the right tools, we&rsquo;re building a more secure and resilient investment ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other notable contributions included remarks from Femi Shobanjo, CEO of NGX RegCo, on the Exchange&rsquo;s self-regulatory mandate, and Adedayo Hamzat, GMD of Zedcrest Group, who advocated for technology-driven portfolio diversification. Abimbola Babalola, Head of Trading and Products at NGX, shared insights on leveraging research and technology for smarter investing, while Dabota Ordor, Head of Retail and Digital Services at United Capital Securities, provided strategies for financial planning, budgeting, and risk management to mitigate market risks.</p>
<p>The Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy ceremony at NGX brought together SEC officials, market leaders, and key stakeholders in a joint commitment to advancing financial literacy. The week-long activities, executed in collaboration with partners such as United Capital Securities, Zedcrest Group, the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), and the Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), demonstrated a collective effort to create a more informed, resilient, and empowered retail investor community.</p>

Summary:
The Treasury Department will host a closed executive session of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to discuss financial developments and regulatory issues. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>On Friday, October, 18, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen will preside over a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) at the Treasury Department.

The meetings bring Council members together to discuss and analyze emerging market developments and financial regulatory issues. The Council is committed to conducting its business as openly and transparently as practicable, given the confidential supervisory and sensitive information at the center of its work. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>

<p><small>* In accordance with the Council&rsquo;s Transparency Policy, which is available at&nbsp;</small><a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><small>www.fsoc.gov</small></a><small>, this meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law; and to conduct administrative business of the Council.&nbsp;</small></p>

<div> Consultation, Pillar 3 data hub, IT solutions, EBA, prudential disclosures
Summary:<br /><br />The EBA is consulting on IT solutions for centralizing prudential disclosures through a Pillar 3 data hub on its website to comply with the new Banking Package. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>The consultation paper defines the IT solutions and processes that large and other institutions shall follow to publish Pillar 3 information centrally in the EBA data hub.</em></li>
<li><em>The proposed IT solutions leverage the EBA&rsquo;s past and ongoing work and infrastructures&nbsp; in the area of disclosures and reporting.</em></li>
<li><em>The Pillar 3 data hub will centralise on the EBA website the Pillar 3 disclosures of all EU institutions, thus allowing users to download data and visualize the Pillar 3 information in a standardised format.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on the Pillar 3 data hub, which will centralise prudential disclosures by institutions through a single electronic access point on the EBA website. This project is part of the Banking Package laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6). This consultation runs until 11 November.</span></p>
<p>The draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) present the IT solutions and processes to be followed by large and other institutions when submitting their respective Pillar 3 disclosures. This includes the IT solutions to be used, the data exchange formats to be considered, the technical validations to be performed by the EBA.</p>
<p>The EBA welcomes feedback both from institutions and users of Pillar 3 information.</p>
<p>The current proposals in the consultation paper consider the feedback received from the industry on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">discussion paper</a>&nbsp;published in December 2023. The summary of this feedback and respective EBA analysis is included in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>In parallel, the EBA continues to run a pilot exercise with voluntary institutions to test the process for large and other institutions. Conclusions from the pilot exercise, together with the feedback received during this consultation, will be taken into account when finalising the draft ITS to be submitted to the European Commission for adoption.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation paper can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 11&nbsp;November 2024. All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<p>A public hearing will be organised in the form of a webinar on 21 October from 15:00 to 16:30 CET.&nbsp;Please register for the hearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-its-p3dh">here</a>&nbsp;by 17 October 13:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, backgrounds d next steps</h4>
<p>The new Banking Package (CRR3/CRD6), which will implement the latest Basel III reforms in the EU, includes a mandate to the EBA to develop a Pillar 3 data hub. The EBA&rsquo;s plan on how to implement the mandates included in the banking package is explained in the &lsquo;EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework&rsquo;, published in December 2023.</p>
<p>The CRR3 (Articles 434 and 434a) mandates the EBA to publish on its website all the prudential disclosures for all institutions subject to these disclosure requirements, making it readily available in a centralised manner to all the relevant stakeholders through a single electronic access point on its website. To comply with this mandate the EBA is building a data hub putting together all the disclosures required under Part Eight of the CRR.</p>
<p>The CRD6 (Article 106) mandates the EBA to issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010,&nbsp;to specify the requirements set out in paragraph 1 under which Competent Authorities are empowered to require disclosures more frequently than required under CRR3, set deadlines to institutions to submit the information to EBA and require institutions to use specific media and locations for publication, other than the EBA website for centralised disclosures.</p>
<p>The draft ITS for small and non-complex institutions and on the resubmission policy will be consulted separately, at a later stage.</p>

<div> Community Banks, Regulatory Challenges, Competition, Cybersecurity, Third-Party Risk Management
Summary:
Community banks face challenges in third-party risk management, competition, and cybersecurity. Regulatory reform is needed for tailoring and supervision.
<br /><br />Summary: Thank you for the opportunity to speak at the 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium. I highlighted the challenges facing community banks, such as competition, cybersecurity, and third-party risk management. Regulatory reforms are needed to ensure tailoring and supervision. <div>
<p>Good afternoon, I'd like to begin by thanking the event organizers, including our staff at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors for inviting me to share my thoughts with you at the 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1">1</a>&nbsp;I always enjoy the opportunity to speak to bankers across the country and share perspectives on the issues facing the banking and financial system, especially when it's related to community banks.</p>
<p>Banks are a critical component of the U.S. economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2">2</a>&nbsp;Their work often extends well beyond the provision of credit&mdash; providing services and volunteer and financial support within their community. Among many things, banks offer financial education, sponsorships and funding for community programs and events. Without question, community banks are important and integral to the local economy.</p>
<p>But community banks also face challenges that require proactive risk management, effective and efficient prioritization of compliance resources, and the need to innovate. Today, I would like to briefly highlight some of the issues banks are facing and discuss ways that community banks and regulators can more effectively work together in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges Facing Community Banks</strong><br />As this audience knows well, community banks face a number of challenges. They often rely on third-party service providers to offer products and services to their customers. It may be more difficult for them to hire and retain qualified staff or plan for future leadership with management succession planning. Given limited staffing, they may be overwhelmed by the recent onslaught of new regulations and guidance. And in light of all of this, it may be challenging to prioritize resources in order to appropriately focus on the most important risks facing their businesses. While the headwinds may seem overwhelming, community banks are always resilient in the face of change.</p>
<p>Often, one of the greatest challenges facing a community bank is not about managing any particular risk but rather how to address all of the risks they face&mdash;and how to&nbsp;<em>prioritize&nbsp;</em>the approach to address each of those risks. Regulators have, at times, exacerbated these challenges through policy choices. The risk of mis-prioritization is not limited to community banks. In my mind, this was most recently evident in the events and supervision leading to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Management failed to address growing interest rate risk and funding risks, and supervisors failed to prioritize and escalate these issues. Our goal should be to identify, understand, and learn from these past mistakes, and to avoid repeating them.</p>
<p>Both regulators and banks should be working toward a common goal&mdash;a banking system that supports economic activity throughout the country, in which banks operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer laws and regulations. In considering the challenges facing community banks, both regulators and banks have an important role to play.</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong><br />Community banks face competitive pressures from many sources. These pressures may result from local or regional economic conditions, the needs of retail and business customers, and the products and services available in the market. Competitors can take the form of traditional banks, internet banks, and non-banks like fin-techs and mortgage companies. While fin-tech partnerships can be beneficial to both the customer and the bank, if the relationship is not managed according to safe and sound banking principles, serious problems can result. When deposits are accepted through fin-tech relationships but not handled appropriately, deposit insurance can be jeopardized and the ability to access deposited funds may be impacted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3">3</a></p>
<p>Competition can also come from other local competitors like credit unions, large banks with a broader operational footprint, payday lenders, or other nonbank credit sources. As bank customers grow increasingly comfortable and familiar with new mechanisms for doing business, the use of online banking has continued to expand. This has tended to increase the footprint of non-local banks or lenders, enabling them to effectively compete for business outside of their geographic area. Even against this backdrop, research shows that community banks have maintained an important role in many banking markets, including in small- and medium-sized business lending.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4">4</a></p>
<p>The regulatory framework establishes expectations for how community banks can compete, and often creates an unlevel playing field with many of these competitors. This includes whether they are subject to the same regulation as banks that engage in the same activities and how competition is evaluated.</p>
<p>A core concept in financial regulation is to impose the same regulation&mdash;and I suggest we expand this to include the same regulation, guidance, and supervisory expectations&mdash;on entities that are engaged in the same activities. Banks compete against many non-bank providers, including financial technology firms, credit unions, and other non-bank lenders. In some of these head-to-head competitions, community banks face distinct disadvantages that can pose challenges when competing for the same banking opportunities. For example, banks are subject to taxes and additional regulatory requirements (including the Community Reinvestment Act). They are also subject to a broader range of restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements or the "soft" power of supervision. In all of these cases, the disparity in the legal framework can have a distortive effect on competition. In short, where the financial regulatory framework can provide for parity of treatment, it should do so. The regulatory framework should not knowingly distort competition, or effectively impose a regulatory allocation of credit.</p>
<p>The framework also plays an important role in assessing competition among banks. The mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) approval process can have a disproportionate impact on community banks because the "screens" that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger often result in a finding that M&amp;A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5">5</a>&nbsp;Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects&mdash;which is grounded in the effect of proposed transactions on the control of deposits within individual banking markets&mdash;often requires additional review or analysis, and can lead to delays in the regulatory approval process.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br />Community banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are costly and time-consuming experiences, and they pose unique challenges for community banks. For example, the maintenance of and the technology resources required to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident "resilience" and response capabilities by identifying resources and opportunities for banks to develop "muscle memory" in cyber incident response.</p>
<p>Recent incidents, like the Crowdstrike-related outage, have highlighted the heavy dependence many banks have on technology, third-party providers, and the broader supply chain. In the current risk environment, it is important for banks of all sizes to implement sound operational resilience, cybersecurity, and third-party risk-management practices. One important resource for community banks is the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk management practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop, with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6">6</a>&nbsp;Over the past two years, this workshop has provided a forum to further cyber risk discussions among community bankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Today's Symposium also includes an interactive cyber workshop, during which participants will participate in a cyber exercise, working through the various decisions that would be required in responding to a hypothetical cyberattack.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7">7</a></p>
<p>We know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system. We also recognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to cyber threats. Therefore, regulators should ensure that a range of resources are available to support community banks and seek further opportunities to help build community bank resilience against these threats.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Risk Management</strong><br />Third-party risk management can pose an additional challenge for community banks. Due to their size and scale, community banks often leverage centralized resources&mdash;technical experts who have greater expertise than the bank could fully maintain on staff&mdash;to advise and assist on a range of issues. Often these third-party service providers are significantly larger, and their bank clients&mdash;including smaller banks&mdash;may lack leverage in conducting due diligence and negotiating the terms of the relationship.</p>
<p>In 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-party risk management, which was expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the time it was issued, the guidance included shortcomings that were known and identified but not addressed in advance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8">8</a></p>
<p>What many of you may not know is that after nearly a year from the original publication, the regulators published a guide to assist community banks&nbsp;<em>interpret&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>apply&nbsp;</em>the guidance to their third-party risk management activities. The guide was intended to provide additional context for the guidance&mdash;including step-by-step examples of how to address third-party risk management&mdash;making the guidance more useful. While I am pleased that the community bank implementation guide was eventually published, the delays in its publication suggest a shortcoming in our regulatory approach. We must ensure new guidance provides clarity to regulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the time the guidance is published.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Compliance</strong><br />Like third-party risk management, consumer compliance can be another area that may present challenges to community banks given their size and scale. An effective and well-run consumer compliance program balances consumer protection with the complexity and cost to establish a robust compliance management program. One challenge for community banks is the difficulty in retaining qualified consumer compliance experts. Notwithstanding these challenges, community banks devote significant time and resources to their consumer compliance risk management programs. Compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, is essential to ensuring that the banking system provides fair and broad access to credit and financial services.</p>
<p>Community banks take these responsibilities seriously, and the overwhelming majority of banks that we supervise invest in strong compliance management systems to prevent violations and detect problems before they occur. When consumer compliance concerns arise, banks address them by making their customers whole and adopting the necessary changes to ensure that issues do not persist or reoccur. In a very small subset of cases, banks fall short of their obligations, and we hold those institutions accountable through enforcement actions or other supervisory actions.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision program is risk-focused and tailored to a bank's compliance risk, focused on the activities that present the greatest risk. One example related to third-party risk management is our recent system supervisory focus on consumer compliance risks associated with fin-tech relationships. As a result of this work, our supervisors seek to identify the parties to relationships that pose the greatest risk of consumer harm. This effort promotes our understanding of higher risk fin-tech partners across the Federal Reserve System, and helps supervisors proactively identify relationships that pose greater risk of consumer harm.</p>
<p><strong>Other Core Risks</strong><br />There are a number of "core" risks that are essential for bank management to address. These "core" risks&mdash;including funding, liquidity and credit risk&mdash;should already be integrated into management priorities, since they pose the greatest threats to a bank's operations.</p>
<p>Focusing on core risks is second nature for community banks. In contrast, supervision can be susceptible to diversion from core to non-core risks leading supervisors to neglect the build-up of traditional risk. Diverting resources to non-core risks can often leave a bank vulnerable, especially when regulators direct banks to allocate resources in other ways, whether by regulation, guidance, or through supervisory expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigating Risks to Community Banks</strong><br />The design of regulation, guidance, and supervisory approach regulators rely upon for community banks&mdash;and the intentional policy choices that underpin this framework&mdash;are important for ensuring their effectiveness in supporting the safety and soundness of the banking system. These design choices can enable community banks to operate successfully while mitigating risks, leveraging tailoring, transparency, and consistency across institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9">9</a>&nbsp;I have spoken at length about these themes in the past, but I would like to reiterate just a few of the critical elements of a regulatory agenda that will allow community banks to thrive in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to revisit size thresholds over time as inflation and economic growth slowly erode our regulatory categories. The bank regulatory framework is built largely upon asset-based size thresholds, and these thresholds should reflect a deliberate policy choice. But, over time, these fixed thresholds effectively result in more firms being "scoped in" to higher compliance tiers over time, even when there has been no change in a bank's underlying risk profile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10">10</a></li>
<li>We need to have a regulatory system in which M&amp;A transactions and de novo bank formations are possible for banks, not one in which regulatory approval requirements are used to impose additional (and extra-regulatory) requirements on firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11">11</a>&nbsp;Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes are necessary to avoid creating a "barbell" of the very largest and very smallest banks in the banking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time. Left unchecked, an applications process that imposes additional costs and delays on healthy and appropriate banking transactions will result in a reduction in available credit and services, an increase in the number of unbanked or underbanked communities, and economic harm.</li>
<li>We should prioritize direct experience in our regulatory efforts, giving greater voice and opportunities for input from policymakers with banking or state supervisory experience currently at the Federal banking agencies, and by soliciting and accepting feedback from our state banking counterparts. Greater coordination and participation by a wider set of policymakers in regulatory reform efforts would bring several benefits. For example, discussion of competing ideas and compromise in the drafting of regulatory proposals often results in a more moderate approach, reducing dramatic swings of the regulatory pendulum. And in many instances, we can better anticipate the unintended consequences of reform proposals if policymakers engage in good faith discussions and coordination of these efforts.</li>
<li>While regulatory reform brings many benefits, we should also shift our mindset to focus on the tradeoffs of regulation, guidance, and supervision. Changes to the regulatory framework often yield benefits in terms of greater visibility into the workings of the banking system, additional capital that can absorb losses and promote financial resiliency, and more conservative risk-management standards for interest rate risk and funding risk. But we need to evaluate not only the benefits of proposals but also the costs and unintended consequences. How will banks adjust their activities in response? Will they raise prices on lending activities or for other banking products or services? Will they exit certain low-margin businesses, resulting in greater concentration and increased financial stability risk? By considering the cumulative burden, we can better address and acknowledge these concerns.</li>
<li>And finally, we must incorporate "tailoring"&mdash;calibrating the regulatory framework based on the size and complexity of banks' activities&mdash;as a required input for regulatory consideration. Tailoring helps us to better allocate finite resources both in banks and among regulators and helps us avoid threatening the long-term viability of community banks by simply adding to the mass of existing regulations, guidance, and other supervisory material. We simply cannot ignore the "cumulative" or "compounding" effect of increasing the complexity of the regulatory framework and we must make room in our reform agenda for the unglamorous work of "maintenance" in promoting an efficient framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>By no means is this proposal for regulatory reform exhaustive, but these critical components must be integrated into our future approach to ensure a diverse banking system for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and for your commitment to community banking. You serve a critical role within the banking system, and in support of the U.S. economy. Your work to leverage the power of the community banking model enables you to serve your customers, promote financial inclusion and expand access to banking services. But policymakers have an important responsibility to make sure that the community banking model remains viable into the future. To function effectively, the banking system requires the presence of banks of all sizes&mdash;larger, regional, and community banks. This diversity of our financial institutions is the greatest strength of our banking system, and it can easily be imperiled by insufficiently targeted regulation, supervision, and guidance.</p>

<div> publishing, Basel Committee, liquidity risk, empirical analysis, supervision<br />
Summary:<br />
Basel Committee updates G20 on banking turmoil analysis, focusing on liquidity risk dynamics and plans to strengthen supervisory effectiveness. <div>
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee provides update to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on its analytical work of the 2023 banking turmoil.</li>
<li>Report summarises empirical analysis on liquidity risk dynamics observed during the turmoil.</li>
<li>Committee will continue work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness and assess whether specific features of the Basel Framework performed as intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is today publishing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d582.htm"><span class="firstword">progress</span>&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on its analytical work of the 2023 banking turmoil. The report, requested by the G20 Brazilian Presidency, provides an update on the Committee's analytical work on liquidity risk dynamics observed during the turmoil. It builds on the Committee's stocktake report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d555.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">published</span></a>&nbsp;in October 2023.</p>
<p>The progress report includes updated empirical analysis on the liquidity outflow rates experienced by distressed banks during the turmoil and assesses the materiality of liquidity risk factors that are not explicitly covered by the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The report also analyses the impact of the accounting treatment and valuation of liquid assets eligible to meet the LCR and other potential impediments to banks' ability and willingness to draw down their liquidity buffer. It also assesses the use and role of supervisory monitoring tools and other stress indicators.</p>
<p>Drawing on the findings of this progress report, the Committee is continuing to pursue a series of follow-up initiatives related to the turmoil, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>prioritising work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness and identify issues that could merit additional guidance at a global level; and</li>
<li>pursuing additional follow-up analytical work based on empirical evidence to assess whether specific features of the Basel Framework, such as liquidity risk and interest rate risk in the banking book, performed as intended during the turmoil and assess the need to explore policy options over the medium term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This follow-up work is fully in line with the imperative of implementing the Basel III standards in a full and consistent manner, and as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>Background</em></h4>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<div> SEC, Moog Inc., FCPA, India, bribery
Summary:
Moog Inc. agreed to pay a $1.1 million civil penalty for violating the FCPA by bribing Indian officials through its subsidiary. The SEC found Moog violated recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions. Moog consented to cease future violations and pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. <br /><br />Summary: The SEC found Moog Inc. violated the FCPA by bribing Indian officials through its subsidiary Moog Motion Controls and agreed to pay a $1.1 million civil penalty. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Moog Inc., a New York-based global manufacturer of motion controls systems for aerospace, defense, industrial and medical markets, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.1 million to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of bribes paid by its wholly owned Indian subsidiary, Moog Motion Controls Private Limited (Moog Motion Controls).</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, from 2020 through 2022, Moog Motion Controls employees bribed a variety of Indian officials to win business and also used a variety of schemes to make the improper payments, including by funneling them through third-party agents and distributors. These same Moog Motion Controls employees also offered cash bribes to Indian officials in an attempt to cause public tenders in India to favor Moog&rsquo;s products and exclude competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s action against Moog highlights the need for issuers operating internationally to have appropriate compliance and internal accounting controls over third parties and third-party payments, as weaknesses in those systems heighten corruption risk,&rdquo; said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Moog violated the recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA.

<div> September 2024, CUSIP issuance report, decrease, new identifiers, corporate, municipal<br />
Summary:<br />
September 2024 CUSIP issuance report shows a decrease in new corporate and municipal identifier requests. Overall, there is a positive trend in volume. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y_d034Z-mnePzVSEe1vuUCeXMwe9KN41yjurc9yA0B4uNple1N5Qx78emULMkwYdJKtQi4NTKYWkOnt8q05C8a9EQuZ_FQQPjzBDzVgY83QtHuDoWv6LdLHQrcxAo94R" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a><span>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for September 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a decrease in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</span></p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,160 in September, which is down 5.8% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 4.3%. The monthly decline in volume was driven by a 7.7% decrease in request volume for U.S. corporate equity identifiers and a 10.0% decrease in request volume for Canadian corporate identifiers. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-5.4%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-19.1%) also fell in September.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 10.2% versus August totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 7.2%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 167 new CUSIP requests in September, followed by New York (134) and California (69).</p>
<p>&ldquo;While CUSIP request volume is down across most asset classes, this month, that is largely a reflection of difficult comparisons to last month, where we saw a significant surge in new issuance activity,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;On an annualized basis, we&rsquo;re seeing a positive trend in CUSIP request volume as we turn the corner to the fourth quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 9.5% in September and international debt CUSIP requests rose 13.2%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 2.4% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 100.3%.</p>

<div> Scams, Retirement planning, Investor protection, InvestSmart® Fest, Financial education
Summary:
InvestSmart® Fest 2024 focuses on retirement planning and protecting investors from scams, with rising scam complaints and an Anti-Scam Zone featured. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today kicked off its annual investor education event InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> Fest 2024, focusing on retirement planning and safeguarding investors from scams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent SC study<sup>1</sup> found that 54% of respondents believe their savings are insufficient for retirement with only 16% confident their funds will last over 20 years after retirement. Alarmingly, 18% of respondents feel their saving can only be sustained for five years or less.</p>
<p>Investor protection also remains a pressing issue, with 3,380 scam related complaints and enquiries received by the SC as of the third quarter of this year. This trend has been on the rise, with a 28%<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; increase last year, proving the evolving sophistication of fraudulent schemes despite regulatory interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As such, InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> Fest 2024 highlights SC&rsquo;s efforts in increasing awareness and knowledge on the benefits of safe investing as well as saving earlier in life.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi stressed that staying vigilant in an increasingly digital world is no longer a priority for investors, but a necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SC remains committed to safeguarding investors, but vigilance is key. Through InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest, we are equipping Malaysians with the tools to recognise threats and make secure financial decisions,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SC Executive Director and General Counsel Yew Yee Tee warned of rising digital scams involving deepfakes, fraudulent pre-IPO schemes and the mislabeling of Shariah compliant products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public must practice caution and ensure they deal with licensed individuals or companies before making any investment decisions," she said in her opening speech at the event.</p>
<p>In response to the growing influence of financial influencers (finfluencers) on social media, the SC has updated the Guidance Note on the Provision of Investment Advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC also cautioned against mule account scams, where victims are persuaded to rent out their bank accounts, leading to serious consequences.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Bursa Malaysia, InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest 2024 will also participate in the &lsquo;Ring the Bell for World Investor Week&rsquo; campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This global initiative organised by the World Federation of Exchanges and spearheaded by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, brings together stock exchanges worldwide to promote investor education and protection.</p>
<p>InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest 2024, expected to draw over 11,000 visitors to Mid Valley Exhibition Centre (MVEC), will feature 40+ exhibitors and 600 free financial planning sessions under <b>#FinPlan4u</b>. For the first time, an <b>&lsquo;Anti-Scam Zone&rsquo;</b><sup>3</sup> will educate the public on scam prevention.</p>
<p>The event is supported by Bursa Malaysia, the Federation of Investment Managers Malaysia, Financial Planning Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Financial Planning Council.</p>

<title>ESMA Publishes First Consolidated Report On Sanctions</title>

<div> regulator, supervisor, administrative sanctions, financial sectors, convergence 
Summary:<br />The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its report on administrative sanctions imposed by National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in EU Member States in 2023. The report highlights the large number and value of administrative fines across EU Member States in the financial sector, with a focus on the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). The report also emphasizes the need for more convergence between NCAs in the exercise of their sanctioning powers. ESMA aims to foster consistent implementation of capital markets rules and ensure similar breaches lead to similar enforcement outcomes across the EU. The underlying data is available for download, and a snapshot of the key findings is published. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1333_Annual_Sanctions_Report.pdf">first consolidated report on sanctions and measures</a>&nbsp;imposed by the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in Member States in 2023.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>In 2023, more than 970 administrative sanctions and measures were imposed across EU Member States in financial sectors under ESMA&rsquo;s remit. The aggregated value of administrative fines amounted to more than 71 million EUR. The highest amounts of administrative fines were imposed under the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Overall, the report highlights that there is still room for more convergence between NCAs in the exercise of their sanctioning powers.</p>
<p>The use of sanctions is only one of multiple tools in the NCA&rsquo;s supervisory toolkit, and supervisory effectiveness cannot be measured solely based on the number or value of the sanctions imposed in a Member State. The consolidated report does not provide a full picture of national enforcement activities; for example, these may also include more informal actions, and not all criminal sanctions are included in the scope of the report.</p>
<p>The data on the use of sanctions included in this report was reported to ESMA by the NCAs. In line with the ESMA Strategy 2023-2028, the consolidated report contributes to supervisory and enforcement convergence and facilitates greater transparency on sanctions.</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p>Building on this report, ESMA will further foster the effective and consistent implementation of capital markets rules and ensure similar breaches lead to similar enforcement outcomes across the EU.</p>
<p>The underlying data is available in excel format and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1508_Consolidated_Sanctions_Report_-_Table_of_Sanctions.xlsx">here</a>. In addition, a snapshot of the report&rsquo;s key findings is published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1551_Enforcement_Snapshot.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<div> Global Business Optimism Insights Report, Q4 2024, Dun & Bradstreet, business optimism, inflation, monetary policies<br />
Summary:<br />
Business optimism increased by 7%, driven by easing inflation and favorable borrowing conditions. U.S., U.K., and Spain saw notable recoveries. Supply chain and financial confidence also improved. ESG initiatives increased. <div>
<p>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, today released its Q4 2024 Global Business Optimism Insights report. The report, fielded in Q3 2024, found a 7% increase in business optimism quarter-over-quarter, driven by gradual easing of inflation rates and favorable borrowing conditions.</p>
<p>Nearly four in five businesses are expressing increased optimism in domestic and export orders, capital expenditures and financial risk due to a combination of easing financial pressures, shifts in monetary policies, robust regulatory frameworks and higher participation in sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>U.S. businesses recorded a nearly 9% rise in optimism, aided by falling inflation and expectations of further rate cuts. Similarly, business optimism in the U.K. and Spain showed notable recoveries as their respective central banks initiated monetary easing, rising by 13% and 9%, respectively. Emerging economies, such as Argentina and India, saw jumps in optimism levels due to declining inflation and increased domestic demand respectively.</p>
<p>"While overall global business optimism has increased and inflation has abated, it's important to recognise that geopolitics contribute to economic uncertainty," said Neeraj Sahai, President of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International. "Industry-specific regulatory risks and more stringent data requirements have emerged as the top concerns among a third of respondents. To mitigate these risks, businesses are considering diversifying their supply chains and markets to manage regulatory risk." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key findings from the Q4 report's five indices include:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Business Optimism Index</b>&nbsp;increased by 7.3% over Q3 2024. This is a significant increase with 75% of businesses, especially smaller businesses, expressing confidence in sales and domestic and export orders ahead of the holiday season. The real estate (12.5%) and utilities (10.4%) sectors saw the highest jumps in optimism levels.</li>
<li><b>The Global Supply Chain Continuity Index</b>&nbsp;improved 6.8%, stemming from businesses reducing burdens on their supply chains by adopting nearshoring, using alternative and less-congestive routes, and relying on domestic supplies. One in four businesses in the U.S., as well as Switzerland and Spain, are considering diversifying supply chains and markets as their preferred strategy to manage their regulatory risk.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business Financial Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;increased 6.3% due to expectations of improved financial conditions and reduced borrowing costs as many economies have started to cut interest rates. Confidence in the U.S. and South Korea notably improved by 5.2% and 11.2%, respectively, on indications of their central banks pivoting towards looser monetary policies.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business Investment Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;improved 3.6%, showcasing optimism in capital spending centered around signs of global monetary policies becoming more accommodative, along with improvement in macroeconomic activities.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business ESG Index</b>&nbsp;increased by 6.1%, stemming from businesses' efforts to meet regulatory requirements, stricter disclosure mandates and heightened investor awareness. Globally, stricter environmental regulations, such as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, are among top concerns for 29% of businesses, resulting in almost one in four conducting risk assessments or implementing regulatory compliance strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Descriptions and information about the indices can be found on page 24 of the report.</p>
<p>"Businesses are increasingly confident as borrowing costs decline, boosting optimism for higher sales, stronger exports, and reduced financial risks," said Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. "This confidence is driving capital investments, with easing supply chain pressures supporting growth in the year's final quarter."</p>
<p><b>About the Global Business Optimism Insights Report</b></p>
<p>The Global Business Optimism Insights report is a synthesis of data from a comprehensive survey encompassing 32 economies, covering approximately 10,000 businesses and 17 sectors, alongside insights from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, leveraging the firm's proprietary data and economic expertise. The report is an amalgamation of five indices which reflect overall business optimism and expectations about supply chain continuity, financial and investment conditions and ESG initiatives. An index reading above 100 indicates an improvement in optimism relative to the base year (Q3 2023 to Q2 2024), while an index reading below 100 signifies a deterioration in optimism.</p>

<div> awards, BMLL, data science, hedge funds, market data
Summary:
BMLL won "Best Data Science Solution Provider" at HedgeWeek US Awards 2024, recognized for providing high-quality historical market data and analytics. Their platform supports start-up and large hedge funds. Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, highlighted the challenges that hedge funds face in obtaining high-quality historical market data and how BMLL addresses this issue by providing high-quality, Level 3, 2, and 1 historical order book data. BMLL’s platform not only simplifies access to deep market insights but also scales with the growing data needs of users. <div>
<p><span>We are delighted to announce that BMLL has won &ldquo;Best Data Science Solution Provider&rdquo; at the HedgeWeek US Awards 2024. These awards recognise excellence among fund managers and service providers in the US across a wide range of categories.</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL was awarded for providing harmonised, Level 3, Level 2 and Level 1 historical data and analytics to hedge funds, helping them improve predictability, quality and speed of alpha through a scalable, managed data and analytics service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The award recognises BMLL&rsquo;s support for start-up hedge funds such as Aleto, who leverage BMLL&rsquo;s data science platform to reduce set-up costs and shorten time to market, as well as BMLL&rsquo;s capabilities for supporting large systematic hedge funds with alpha generation and operational needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Specifically, BMLL helps quant teams deliver predictive alphas: using BMLL&rsquo;s suite of predictive analytics and scalable research, they can unlock patterns in market behaviour, improve signal generation and optimise algorithm performance at a fraction of the cost of building the capabilities in-house.</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL&rsquo;s ready-to-use, quant-built data science platform, provides hedge funds with the necessary research infrastructure to support their specific operation and growth from the outset, without the high upfront costs and lengthy timelines normally associated with launching a quantitative or systematic fund.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are thrilled to be named Best Data Science Solution Provider at the Hedgeweek US Awards 2024. Hedge funds face significant challenges in obtaining high-quality historical market data, as incumbent real-time data providers often only supply commoditised historical data that lacks the granularity and accuracy needed for effective quantitative strategy development. These data gaps can negatively impact strategy performance and lead to excessive resource allocation for data cleansing and normalisation.</span></p>
<p><span>At BMLL, we address this issue by providing hedge funds with high-quality, Level 3, 2, and 1 historical order book data that captures and displays the trading intentions of all market participants. This enables our clients to access clean, reliable data without the need for extensive in-house infrastructure, allowing them to focus on research and development. Our platform not only simplifies access to deep market insights but also scales with the growing data needs of our users, helping them optimise their strategies and stay competitive in a fast-evolving market.&rdquo;</span></p>

ASIC cancelled two AFS licences and 11 credit licences for failing to maintain AFCA membership, late compliance, and other breaches.
<br /><br />Summary: ASIC cancelled AFS and credit licences for non-compliance, late compliance, and other breaches, including failure to maintain AFCA membership. <div>
<p>ASIC has cancelled two Australian financial services licences (AFS licence) and 11 Australian credit licences (collectively, the Licensees).</p>
<p>The Licensees were required by law to be a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). AFCA membership gives consumers access to a free, fair, and independent dispute resolution scheme if a complaint cannot be resolved internally by a Licensee.</p>
<p>ASIC works with AFCA to identify AFS licence and credit licence holders that do not comply with their obligation to maintain their AFCA membership.</p>
<p>If an entity is expelled from the scheme or requests to withdraw membership, AFCA must notify ASIC. Where an entity fails to comply, or is otherwise in breach of general conduct obligations, ASIC will continue to take action to cancel AFS licence or credit licences.</p>
<p>The Licensees have, varyingly:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>failed to be a member of AFCA</li>

</ul>
<p>Under section 55 of the Credit Act, ASIC has the power to cancel a credit licence if a credit licence holder has contravened its general conduct obligations under section 47. This includes the obligation to be a member of AFCA and the obligation to comply with the credit legislation. Section 53(1) of the Credit Act outlines the obligation to lodge an ACC and is defined as credit legislation in section 5 of the Credit Act.</p>
<p>Under section 54(1)(d) of the Credit Act, ASIC may cancel a credit licence if the levies and late payment penalties relating to those levies have not been paid in full within 12 months after the due date for payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Report 797&nbsp;<em>Licensing and professional registration activities: 2024 update&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-797-licensing-and-professional-registration-activities-2024-update/" title="REP 797 Licensing and professional registration activities: 2024 update">REP 797</a>) provides the latest information on registration and licence applications from the 2023-24 financial year and key changes to licensing processes.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Consults On Improving Retail Investor Access To Long-Term Asset Investments</title>

<div> Framework Proposal, Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund, Retail Investors, Investment Fund, Illiquid Assets
Summary:<br /><br />The Ontario Securities Commission proposed the Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund to allow retail investors access to illiquid assets through a new investment fund structure. The aim is to provide opportunities for diversification and potential higher returns while protecting investors and fostering capital formation. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/8/81-737/osc-consultation-paper-81-737-opportunity-improve-retail-investor-access-long-term-assets-through">published a consultation paper</a>&nbsp;aimed at improving retail investor access to illiquid investments through a framework proposal for a long-term asset investment fund product structure.</p>
<p>The consultation proposes the creation of a new investment fund category, the Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund (OLTF), which would allow Ontarians to invest in assets they may not traditionally have exposure to. These assets include venture capital, private debt and equity, and infrastructure and natural resource projects. OLTFs could offer opportunities for more retail investors to participate in capital-intensive projects, while enabling businesses to lower funding costs and raise the capital necessary for growth.</p>
<p>Investors would have an opportunity to diversify their portfolio across assets, but also across different types of businesses or projects. There are existing investment vehicles that would allow access to these assets, but many are privately funded and unavailable to retail investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long-term assets provide a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and potentially achieve higher returns over an extended period,&rdquo; said Raymond Chan, Senior Vice President, Investment Management. &ldquo;Through this consultation, we hope to identify how to broaden investor access to these benefits while also mitigating the risks inherent in illiquid assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-term assets are illiquid assets that cannot be readily disposed of, may be difficult to value, and generally have longer investment time horizons than other assets. An investment fund would provide retail investors with an investment vehicle whose regulatory framework is more specifically tailored to their needs.</p>
<p>The proposed new framework would allow retail investors to gain exposure to these long-term assets through the professional management of a registered investment fund manager and registered portfolio manager. Distribution through a prospectus-qualified investment fund product would mean that suitability, &ldquo;know-your-client&rdquo; (KYC) and &ldquo;know-your-product" (KYP) requirements would generally apply. The consultation also seeks feedback on investor access to OLTFs through order-execution-only, or &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; dealers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The long-term asset fund proposal aims to create a framework that protects investors while fostering innovation and capital formation,&rdquo; continued Chan.</p>
<p>The feedback received will guide the next phase of the proposal, which is anticipated to be the publication for comment of proposed rule amendments and policy changes.</p>
<p>Please submit comments in writing on or before February 7, 2025.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<div> fraud, manipulation, securities law, artificial intelligence, investor protection
Summary: Under securities law, AI can be used for fraud and manipulation. Deployers must ensure guardrails to prevent harm and be held accountable. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Tym3pO261Gc">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-transcript-fraud-deception-artificial-intelligence-101024#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>



</p>
<p>In 1950, the famous mathematician Alan Turing asked, &ldquo;Can machines think?&rdquo; What does that mean for securities law, particularly the laws related to fraud and manipulation?</p>
<p>Bad actors, ever since antiquity, have found new ways to deceive the public. With artificial intelligence, fraudsters have yet a new tool to exploit. But make no mistake. Under the securities law, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>Former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein recently wrote about what happens when you combine AI, finance and the law of fraud. She spoke of three types of harm.</p>
<p>The first: Programmable Harm. It's kind of straightforward. If someone uses an algorithm and is optimizing to manipulate or defraud the public, that's just fraud.</p>
<p>Gets interesting when we get to the second category: Predictable Harm. Again, I think it's reasonably straightforward. In essence, has someone recklessly or knowingly disregarded a foreseeable risk in deploying a particular AI model? In essence, did they act reasonably?</p>
<p>You see, under the securities law, you aren't supposed to trade in front of your customers. That's called front running. You aren't supposed to spoof. In other words, place a fake order. You aren't supposed to lie to the public. Well, it's equally important that the robots, I mean AI models, don't do these things either. Investor protection requires that the humans who deploy the model put in place appropriate guardrails.</p>
<p>Some might ask, what if the AI models themselves are self-learning? They're changing. They're adapting. What if the AI models hallucinate, which we all know sometimes they do. I still believe that those who deploy the AI models should have appropriate guardrails for that as well.</p>
<p>That brings up the third category. In essence, when firms might deploy an AI model that create Unpredictable Harm. How do we hold those firms responsible? While some of that might play out in court, I think right now the harms are mostly either programmable or predictable, because we do know that these models may self-learn, may hallucinate. We do know that there are things that you're not supposed to do, like lie to the public.</p>
<p>You know, there was a famous early movie executive, Joseph Kennedy. He also went on to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And his son became president. Well, what did Chair Kennedy say in this seat 90 years ago? He said, &ldquo;The Commission will make war without quarter on any who sell securities by fraud or misrepresentation.&rdquo; And I think he meant the AI model deployers as well.</p>

Private equity investments offer high returns in exchange for taking a certain level of risk. Manufacturing and natural resources have different volatility and Value at Risk (VaR). privateMetrics uses asset-level private equity indices. Proper private asset risk measurement requires different data that genuinely takes account of the evolution in the risk premia to which the investments are exposed. Indices and benchmarks reflect the level of market prices and the risk of each segment over time.
<br /><br />Summary: Private equity investments offer high returns but come with a certain level of risk. Manufacturing and natural resources have different volatility and Value at Risk. Asset-level private equity indices are used for proper risk measurement. <div>
<p><span>Private equity investments offer high returns in exchange for taking a certain level of risk. These risks result first and foremost in considerable return dispersion and sometimes, despite the long-term investment horizon, in exits in less favourable conditions than anticipated by investors. Private companies can also go bankrupt, but they are more likely to do so in certain segments of the private market. Stratifying the PE universe using the PECCS taxonomy, a range of risk/return profiles appears that suggest a wide range of risk-taking and return-seeking strategies (figure 1).</span><br /><br /><i>Figure 1: Dispersion of 10-year Volatility and Value at Risk (confidence interval 97.5%) of PECCS Activities in Europe</i></p>

<p><br /><span>Proper private asset risk measurement requires different data that genuinely takes account of the evolution in the risk premia to which the investments are exposed, and doing this requires indices and benchmarks that reflect these risks. privateMetrics market indices and benchmarks are asset-level private equity indices that reflect the dynamics of private markets with a beta of 1. They are built by repricing thousands of private companies each month using the latest private market transactions to calibrate an asset pricing model. This approach achieves a high degree of pricing precision at the market segment level, ensuring that indices and benchmarks built with this data accurately reflect the level of market prices and of the risk of each segment over time.</span><br /><br /><span>To find out more:</span></p>

<title>FinCEN Assesses Record $1.3 Billion Penalty Against TD Bank</title>

<div> settlement, TD Bank, violations, AML program, FinCEN
Summary:
The largest penalty of $1.3 billion was imposed on TD Bank by FinCEN for BSA violations and AML program failures. Independent monitorship and remediation required. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) assessed a record&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2024-10-10/FinCEN-TD-Bank-Consent-Order-508FINAL.pdf">$1.3 billion penalty</a>&nbsp;against TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (collectively, TD Bank, or the Bank) for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the primary U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) law that safeguards the financial system from illicit use. TD Bank is among the largest banks in the United States.</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s $1.3 billion settlement is the largest penalty against a depository institution in U.S. Treasury and FinCEN history. FinCEN&rsquo;s action also imposes a four-year independent monitorship to oversee TD Bank&rsquo;s required remediation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of financial institutions have partnered with FinCEN to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system. TD Bank did the opposite. From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank&rsquo;s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system,&rdquo; said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. &ldquo;Our historic action represents a significant step in safeguarding our country and communities from criminal activity like fentanyl and human trafficking by requiring TD Bank to fix the vast deficiencies in its safeguards against money laundering. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to taking action to keep our communities safe from the sort of behavior facilitated by illicit finance and enabled by TD Bank&rsquo;s lax oversight, and we are making clear that financial institutions will face severe repercussions if they fail to maintain necessary safeguards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For over a decade, TD Bank allowed its AML program to languish, making TD Bank a target for illicit actors&mdash;including its own employees,&rdquo; said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki. &ldquo;The magnitude of FinCEN&rsquo;s action is consistent with the harm that TD Bank&rsquo;s failures caused. This historic action should serve as a powerful reminder that we will not tolerate financial institutions who flagrantly violate their obligation to safeguard our financial system from criminal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, TD Bank admits that it willfully failed to implement and maintain an AML program that met the minimum requirements of the BSA and FinCEN&rsquo;s implementing regulations. FinCEN&rsquo;s investigation revealed that TD Bank knew that its AML program was neither appropriately designed nor adequately resourced to mitigate the actual illicit finance risks that it faced on multiple fronts. Among other failures, TD Bank&rsquo;s processing of peer-to-peer transactions (e.g., Venmo and Zelle), including transactions indicative of human trafficking, was insufficient, and as a result, TD Bank failed to identify and timely report these transactions to FinCEN. TD Bank also allowed significant backlogs of potentially suspicious activity to persist, thereby depriving law enforcement of necessary information. TD Bank knew that it was the subject of significant funnel account activity involving high-risk countries yet failed to take timely action to address this substantial risk.</p>
<p>TD Bank also failed to timely detect suspicious activity involving its own employees. For example, in 2021, a TD Bank employee facilitated the laundering of narcotics proceeds in exchange for bribes. This employee opened numerous accounts, including for shell companies, that then engaged in millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of funnel account activity in a high-risk jurisdiction where TD Bank maintained no operations. TD Bank knew that this type of activity was not subject to appropriate controls and failed to mitigate this glaring risk.</p>
<p>As a result of these failures, TD Bank allowed trillions of dollars in transactions annually to go unmonitored for potentially suspicious activity that would require reporting to FinCEN. Specifically, during the time period covered by the Consent Order, TD Bank willfully failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on thousands of suspicious transactions&mdash;totaling approximately $1.5 billion. Additionally, TD Bank&rsquo;s Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) of large cash transactions were often delayed, and, in some instances, misleading to law enforcement.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to properly limit or report suspicious transactions and cash activity that included substantial criminal activity, as further detailed in the Consent Order. For example, from 2017 to 2021, TD Bank facilitated over $400 million in transactions for Da Ying Sze (Sze), who pled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/queens-man-admits-orchestrating-653-million-money-laundering-conspiracy-operating" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guilty to money laundering</a>&nbsp;in 2022 for his role in conspiring to hide proceeds of narcotics trafficking. Sze conducted most of these transactions in large sums of cash (often in bags that Sze brought into TD Bank branches), yet the Bank failed to timely limit or restrict Sze&rsquo;s activity. TD Bank failed to timely file SARs on a substantial portion of this activity and also failed to identify Sze in more than 500 CTRs totaling more than $400 million, which hindered FinCEN and law enforcement.</p>
<p>TD Bank has agreed to engage an independent consultant, who, under the auspices of FinCEN&rsquo;s monitor, would conduct a historical analysis of TD Bank&rsquo;s transaction data, often referred to as a &ldquo;SAR lookback,&rdquo; to remediate the SAR filings that TD Bank missed due to its extensive control gaps. TD Bank has also agreed that the monitor will oversee an independent, end-to-end review of its AML Program. For the first time, FinCEN is imposing accountability and data governance reviews. The accountability review will independently assess the involvement or failure to escalate by TD Bank personnel in conjunction with certain conduct described in the Consent Order&rsquo;s Statement of Facts. The accountability review will provide corresponding recommendations to the Bank, including recommendations related to the culture of compliance at TD Bank. The data governance review will help to ensure that TD Bank identifies and fixes the root causes of many gaps in its AML program.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will also announce settlements in parallel investigations today.</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s Enforcement and Compliance Division is responsible for investigating serious violations of the BSA. For additional information regarding the facts and circumstances associated with this enforcement action, including the specific BSA violations and their underlying causes, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2024-10-10/FinCEN-TD-Bank-Consent-Order-508FINAL.pdf">Consent Order</a>&nbsp;between FinCEN and TD Bank.</p>

<div> Treasury Department, sanctions, AML laws, TD Bank, FinCEN<br />
Summary:<br />
Treasury Department penalizes TD Bank $1.3 billion for AML failures enabling drug trafficking, requiring remedial measures and a four-year monitor. Collaboration across agencies emphasized. <div>
<p>Thank you. I am glad to join Attorney General Garland, Deputy Attorney General Monaco, and the rest of you here today. I applaud DOJ&rsquo;s efforts. I won&rsquo;t speak to its case, but to the separate investigation that Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network undertook and the action we&rsquo;ve taken.</p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury utilizes sanctions and the enforcement of our country&rsquo;s anti-money laundering (AML) laws to protect our national security from illicit actors. From drug trafficking to combatting Russian aggression, the Treasury Department is committed to using all of the tools available to us to protect the American people.</p>
<p>We are proud of the public-private partnership we have formed with the financial sector to protect our national security. The vast majority of financial institutions work hand-in-hand with Treasury to keep our country and our communities safe.</p>
<p>TD Bank has done the exact opposite. For more than a decade, through deliberate actions&mdash;and inaction&mdash;TD Bank failed to meet its responsibilities.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to implement or maintain a sufficient AML compliance program.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to monitor trillions of dollars in transactions each year, including those the Bank knew posed a high-risk for abuse.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to conduct adequate due diligence on high-risk customers, ignoring glaring red flags.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to live up to its responsibilities to the American people.</p>
<p>I want to be clear, these systemic failures did not just create hypothetical vulnerabilities, but they resulted in actual, material harm to American citizens and communities. Time and again, unlike its peers, TD Bank prioritized growth and profit over complying with the law.</p>
<p>The bank enabled drug trafficking. In one example from FinCEN&rsquo;s investigation, TD Bank facilitated over $400 million in transactions to launder money on behalf of criminals that were selling fentanyl and other deadly drugs that are poisoning our neighborhoods. In exchange for filing false or misleading reports on these transactions, TD Bank tellers accepted gift cards as bribes. In another example, TD Bank failed to detect the suspicious activities of one of its own employees who was accepting bribes in exchange for opening accounts in the name of shell companies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why today we are announcing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&rsquo;s (FinCEN) $1.3 billion penalty on TD Bank, the largest civil monetary penalty against a bank in Treasury&rsquo;s history.<br />In addition to a historic penalty, TD Bank has agreed to a four-year monitor to oversee its extensive remedial measures, including end-to-end review of its AML program. The bank will also be required to provide missing suspicious activity reports and, for the first time, FinCEN will require additional accountability and data governance reviews to provide recommendations for changing TD Bank&rsquo;s culture of noncompliance.</p>
<p>Together, these requirements hold TD Bank accountable for its egregious and willful disregard of the law and the real harm it caused. This action demonstrates that we are committed to holding individuals and institutions accountable.</p>
<p>Let me end by thanking FinCEN, the IRS Criminal Investigation team, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of Justice for their collaboration. We look forward to continuing to work together to enforce our nation&rsquo;s laws and protect our national security.</p>

<div> fined, Toronto-Dominion Bank, anti-money laundering, U.S. operations, compliance<br />
Summary: 
The Federal Reserve fined TD Bank $123.5 million for anti-money laundering violations, requiring enhanced measures to comply with U.S. regulations. Canada's OSFI can assist in implementation. Various U.S. agencies are also taking regulatory actions. TD is pleading guilty to criminal charges. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday fined Toronto-Dominion Bank $123.5 million for violations related to anti-money laundering laws. The Board is also requiring TD to implement enhanced measures to comply with anti-money laundering laws and to correct its risk management deficiencies.</p>
<p>TD failed to conduct adequate risk management and oversight of its retail banking operations in the United States, resulting in a U.S. subsidiary being used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds. The Board's action will help ensure that TD operates in compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Board is requiring TD to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a new office in the United States dedicated to remediating the deficiencies identified in the order;</li>
<li>Relocate to the United States the parts of its anti-money laundering compliance program that are responsible for complying with U.S. law. This program will be subject to oversight by U.S. regulators;</li>
<li>Certify that sufficient resources and attention are allocated to correcting the firm's anti-money laundering deficiencies prior to issuing any dividends or capital distributions; and</li>
<li>Undertake a thorough and independent review of the firm's board of directors and management to ensure adequate oversight of the U.S. operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the home country supervisor of TD, can act in the implementation of these requirements as permitted by its legal authority.</p>
<p>This action is being taken in conjunction with criminal and regulatory actions that are being taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The penalties announced by the agencies total approximately $3.09 billion. The bank is also pleading guilty to criminal charges brought by law enforcement authorities.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Cumberland DRW For Operating As An Unregistered Dealer In The Crypto Asset Markets</title>

<div> charged, Cumberland DRW LLC, crypto assets, securities, registration
<br />
Cumberland DRW LLC charged with unregistered dealing of over $2 billion crypto assets as securities. SEC seeks injunction, disgorgement, and penalties.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="article-location-publishdate">The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Chicago-based Cumberland DRW LLC with operating as an unregistered dealer in more than $2 billion of crypto assets offered and sold as securities, in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws that are designed to protect investors.</p>
<p class="article-location-publishdate">According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, since at least March 2018 through the present, Cumberland has acted as an unregistered dealer by buying and selling crypto assets offered and sold as securities for its own accounts as part of its regular business. As alleged in the complaint, Cumberland publicly calls itself &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s leading liquidity providers&rdquo; in crypto assets and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week by trading with counterparties by the telephone or through its online trading platform, Marea. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint further alleges that Cumberland engages in trading crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts on third-party crypto asset exchanges as part of its regular business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal securities laws require all dealers in all securities to register with the Commission, and those who operate in the crypto asset markets are no exception,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU). &ldquo;Despite frequent protestations by the industry that sales of crypto assets are all akin to sales of commodities, our complaint alleges that Cumberland, the respective issuers, and objective investors treated the offer and sale of the crypto assets at issue in this case as investments in securities, and Cumberland profited from its dealer activity in these assets without providing investors and the market with the important protections afforded by registration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Cumberland with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Andrew McFall of the SEC&rsquo;s Market Abuse Unit and Kathleen Hitchins of the CACU and supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Paul Kim, and Mr. Tenreiro of the CACU. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Christopher Martin and Timothy Stockwell and supervised by Jack Kaufman and Mr. Tenreiro.</p>

<title>SEC Issues $12 Million Award To Joint Whistleblowers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> whistleblowers, SEC, enforcement action, award, investor protection fund
Summary:<br />SEC awards $12 million to three whistleblowers for assisting in enforcement action. Whistleblower program offers awards of 10-30% for credible information leading to successful enforcement. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $12 million award to be split among three joint whistleblowers who provided critical information and assistance in an SEC enforcement action.</p>
<p>The joint whistleblowers provided the SEC significant information and extensive cooperation, which helped expand the scope of the investigation and the charges brought in the enforcement action and also saved the agency substantial time and resources. The joint whistleblowers met numerous times with SEC&rsquo;s enforcement staff and certain of the joint whistleblowers suffered hardships due to their whistleblowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whistleblowers play a key role in helping the SEC hold wrongdoers accountable,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower. &ldquo;Even where an investigation is already open, whistleblowers may contribute by providing new information about misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Payments to whistleblowers are made out of an investor protection fund, established by Congress, which is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.&nbsp;Whistleblower awards can range from 10 to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<title>OCC Issues Cease and Desist Order, Assesses $450 Million Civil Money Penalty, and Imposes Growth Restriction Upon TD Bank, N.A. for BSA/AML Deficiencies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced a cease and desist order and a $450 million civil money penalty against TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (bank), for deficiencies in the bank&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance program. Today&rsquo;s action also imposes a restriction on the growth of the bank and a measure designed to ensure that the bank invests sufficient resources to remediate its BSA/AML deficiencies in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TD Bank&rsquo;s persistent prioritization of growth over controls allowed its employees to break the law and facilitate the laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank&rsquo;s blatant risk management failures attracted illicit actors and are egregious and unacceptable,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;The OCC&rsquo;s coordinated and comprehensive action, including the imposition of an asset cap, will ensure that the bank focuses on building proper controls commensurate with its risk profile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC determined that the bank failed to develop and maintain a BSA/AML program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA and its implementing regulations. Deficiencies in the bank&rsquo;s BSA/AML program included those related to internal controls and risk management practices; risk assessments; customer due diligence; customer risk ratings; suspicious activity identification, evaluation, and reporting; governance; staffing; independent testing; and training, among others.</p>
<p>The OCC found that the bank had significant, systemic breakdowns in its transaction monitoring program. The bank processed hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions with clear indicia of highly suspicious activity, creating a potential for significant money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit financial transactions. The bank repeatedly failed to take appropriate and timely corrective action to address the highly suspicious activity and failed to properly emphasize BSA/AML compliance.</p>
<p>The bank had a systemic breakdown in its processes to identify and report suspicious activity, and a pattern or practice of noncompliance with the suspicious activity report filing requirement, resulting in numerous violations. The bank also violated currency transaction reporting requirements on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>The OCC action is being taken in coordination with concurrent actions by the Department of Justice, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The OCC-assessed penalty will be directed to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Rimar Capital USA, Inc. (Rimar USA), Rimar Capital, LLC (Rimar LLC), Itai Liptz, and Clifford Boro for making false and misleading statements about Rimar LLC&rsquo;s purported use of artificial intelligence, or AI, to perform automated trading for client accounts and numerous other material misrepresentations. The parties agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges and pay $310,000 in total civil penalties.</p>
<p>According to the SEC order, Liptz, owner and CEO of Rimar LLC and Rimar USA, with the help of Boro, a Rimar USA board member, raised nearly $4 million from 45 investors for the development of Rimar LLC, an investment adviser that was falsely described as having an AI-driven platform for trading securities. The order found that the Rimar entities, Liptz, and Boro also made misrepresentations about Rimar LLC&rsquo;s assets under management and its investment returns. In addition, the order found that Rimar LLC and Liptz obtained advisory clients using the misleading statements and that Liptz misappropriated company funds for personal expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through entities he controlled, Liptz lured investors and clients with multiple fabrications, including with buzzwords about the latest AI technology,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;As AI becomes more popular in the investing space, we will continue to be vigilant and pursue those who lie about their firms&rsquo; technological capabilities and engage in &lsquo;AI washing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Rimar USA, Rimar LLC, Liptz, and Boro consented to the entry of an order finding antifraud violations and to cease and desist from violating the charged provisions. Liptz consented to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $213,611, to pay a $250,000 civil penalty, and to be subject to an investment company prohibition and associational bar with the right to reapply in five years. Boro agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty. Rimar LLC consented to be censured.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/artificial-intelligence-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;about AI and investment fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Payam Danialypour under the supervision of Brent Wilner, Associate Regional Director of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and Mr. Dean. Roberto Grasso of the Division of Examinations, Office of Risk and Strategy assisted with the investigation.</p>

<div> Civil Rights Movement, South Carolina, Entrepreneurship, Economics, Women
Summary:
- Dr. Lisa D. Cook shares her story of growing up, experiences in economics, and the role of entrepreneurs in the economy. She emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship, innovation, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her personal narrative adds a human touch to the discussion of economics and policymaking. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction, Jennet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Let me start by saying my thoughts are with all the people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia who have felt the force of Helene's and Milton's impact. I am saddened by the tragic loss of life and widespread disruption in this region. The Federal Reserve Board and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area. As we normally do in these unfortunate situations, we are encouraging institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the needs of their communities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>It is an honor to stand before you and speak to this group of audacious, innovative women. I am also very happy to be back in Charleston. I grew up in Milledgeville, Georgia, just about 250 miles down the road. Some of my fondest childhood memories of traveling in the South, especially as a Girl Scout, include South Carolina.</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk with you about the important role startups, new businesses, and entrepreneurship play in our economy from the perspective of a Federal Reserve policymaker. I also want to share a bit of my story. Just like many of you&mdash;including those who have started a business or those who dream of doing that someday&mdash;I have faced and overcome hurdles along a winding path.</p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong><br />I was born and raised in Milledgeville, where my mother, Professor Mary Murray Cook, was a faculty member in the Nursing Department of Georgia College and State University. She was the first tenured African American faculty member at that university. My father, Rev. Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain and then in senior leadership at the hospital there. My family lived through the events that brought Milledgeville out of a deeply segregated South. My sisters and I were among the first African American students to desegregate the schools we attended. I drew strength from the example set by my family, others in the Civil Rights Movement, and the village that raised me and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that was not the initial field of study I pursued. I entered Spelman College in Atlanta as a physics and philosophy major. After graduation, I had the honor of studying at the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar.</p>
<p>After Oxford, I continued my education at the University of Dakar in Senegal in West Africa. However, at the end of my year in Africa, it was the chance to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in East Africa where I discovered my love of economics. I hiked alongside a British economist, and, by the end of the trek, he convinced me that studying economics would provide me with the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time.</p>
<p>I went on to earn my Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley<a name="f1"></a>. Entering the economics profession came with its usual challenges, and, for women, a few more challenges existed. To this day, women are still underrepresented in economics. Women earned just 34 percent of bachelor's degrees in economics and 36 percent of Ph.D.'s in economics in 2022, the most recent available data from the U.S. Department of Education. The share of women earning those degrees rose only modestly from 1999, when women earned about 32 percent of economics bachelor's degrees and 27 percent of Ph.D.'s. The data stand in sharp contrast to all science and engineering degrees, including in social science fields, where women earned roughly half of degrees granted in 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Education was paramount in my family and was construed as a means of realizing the promise of the Civil Rights Movement and continual improvement of our society and economy. Of course, economics, like physics, is a field where math skills are vitally important. Between my mother, my aunts, and my extended family, I had essentially understood STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)-related jobs to be women's work. I was grateful to have these role models in my orbit to give me the confidence to undertake study in a STEM field.</p>
<p>Access and encouragement for girls to pursue study in math and science are a significant concern. Economist Dania V. Francis's research shows that Black girls are disproportionately under-recommended for Advanced Placement calculus.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The course is often a gateway for economics, for STEM classes, and for college preparation, in general.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>My mentors and role models encouraged careful study, teaching, and scholarship and helped me block out the voices saying I did not belong at each juncture. They encouraged my work and have been champions for me. As a result, I have been committed to serving as a mentor, as well. For several years, I was the director of and taught in the American Economic Association's Summer Program, an important training ground for disadvantaged students considering economics careers. Each year, the share of students who are women oscillated between 41 percent and 67 percent, much higher than the enrollment in undergraduate economics courses nationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;I told those students&mdash;and continue to tell them as they make their way through graduate programs in economics and through the economics profession&mdash;"You belong here. Your insights are unique, and the profession will benefit from them."</p>
<p>In my career as an economist, I studied, researched, and taught in roles at universities and worked in the private sector and in government before I was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate to become a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 2022. I am honored and humbled to serve in this role and proud to be the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors. As Fed policymakers, we make decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American by focusing on the dual mandate given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurs' Vital Role in the Economy</strong><br />In my years of conducting research and while at the Board, I have met many inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs who made important contributions to the economy. Many of them happened to be women who were very knowledgeable, creative, and inspiring. So I want to discuss the vital role entrepreneurship and new business creation play in our economy.</p>
<p>You might ask what interest I have in this subject, as a monetary policymaker focused closely on the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Well, this topic has interested me for a long time, and I conducted a fair amount of research on entrepreneurship and innovation before joining the Board. But the topic is also important precisely because of our dual mandate. To convince you of this, I will explain a few of the ways in which economists think about entrepreneurship, and how they relate to the dual mandate.</p>
<p>The first is the most basic: For many people&mdash;many millions, in fact&mdash;entrepreneurship or self-employment is a career choice.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;It is their preferred way of participating in the labor market and obtaining income for themselves and their families. They prefer to be their own bosses, with all the benefits and risks that entails.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;But whether they end up hiring others or not, self-employed individuals support the labor market by providing a job for themselves.</p>
<p>A second way economists think about entrepreneurship is a little broader: New business creation is a large contributor to overall job growth. In fact, new businesses punch above their weight. For example, during the handful of years before the pandemic, in a typical year only about 8 percent of all employer firms were new entrants, but these new entrants accounted for about 15 percent of annual gross job creation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;And research has found that this job creation effect is long lasting. Even though many new firms do not survive, those that do survive tend to grow rapidly over 5 to 10 years, largely offsetting the job losses from those firms that shut down.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A third way economists think about entrepreneurship, which I have explored in my own research, is that a small but critical subset of new firms are innovators&mdash;they introduce new products or business processes that change how we consume or produce.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;As such, they make large contributions to overall productivity growth over time. That is, innovative entrepreneurs help enable us to do more with less&mdash;and even more so if access to innovation participation is equitable.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;It is important that everyone, including women, historically underrepresented groups, people from certain geographic regions, and other diverse representative groups, can participate in the entrepreneurship and innovation economy. In my research, I have found that investors underrate the prospects of Black-founded, or simply outsider-founded, startups in early funding stages. Better assessment of the early stages of invention and innovation could broaden the range of new entrants and the ideas they contribute to their local communities and the broader economy.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the Dual Mandate</strong><br />So let's return to the dual mandate. You can now understand that self-employment and entrepreneurial job creation are relevant for our employment mandate. Indeed, one could argue that entrepreneurs are critical to Fed policymakers' efforts to promote maximum employment. And the productivity gains we reap from entrepreneurship are like productivity growth from any other source. When the pace of productivity growth increases, it allows for economic activity and wage growth to be robust while also being consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>The importance of business startups to our dual mandate objectives is why I have watched closely as various measures of new business formation have surged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Applications for new businesses jumped to a record pace shortly after the pandemic struck the U.S.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The pace of applications has remained elevated above pre-pandemic norms all the way from the summer of 2020 to the most recent data, even though the pace appears to be cooling some this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;At first, it might have seemed like these business applications were mainly being submitted by people who lost their jobs, or perhaps by an increase in "gig economy" work. There was doubtless some of that going on, but research and data since then have painted a more optimistic picture.</p>
<p>When researchers look across areas of the country, the pandemic business applications had only a weak connection with layoffs. The surge in applications persisted long after overall layoffs fell to the subdued pace we have seen since early 2021. The applications did have a strong relationship with workers voluntarily leaving their jobs. Some quitting workers may have chosen to join these new businesses as founders or early employees. And surging business applications were soon followed by new businesses hiring workers and expanding. Over the last two years of available data, new firms created 1.9 million jobs per year, a pace not seen since the eve of the Global Financial Crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>The industry patterns of this surge reflect shifts in consumer and business needs resulting from the pandemic and its aftermath. For example, in large metro areas, new business creation shifted from city centers to the suburbs, perhaps because of the increase in remote work. Suddenly, people wanted to eat lunch or go to the gym closer to their home, rather than close to their downtown office. Likewise, consumer and business tastes for more online purchases, with the shipping requirements that entails, are evident in the surge of business entry in the online retail and transportation sectors. But this is not only about moving restaurants closer to workers or changing patterns of goods consumption. There was also a particularly strong entry into high-tech industries, such as data processing and hosting, as well as research and development services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That may have more to do with developments like artificial intelligence than with the pandemic specifically, as I discussed in a speech in Atlanta last week.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Economists will spend years debating the various causes of the surge in business creation during and soon after the pandemic. Perhaps strong monetary and fiscal policy backstopping aggregate demand played some role, or pandemic social safety net policies, or simply the accommodative financial conditions of 2020 and 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Indeed, more research is needed and will be the subject of many dissertations in the near future.</p>
<p>I do think a large part of the story is ultimately a case of resourceful and determined American entrepreneurs, perhaps including some of you, responding to the tumultuous shocks of the pandemic. They, like some of you, stepped in to meet the rapidly changing needs of households and businesses. This points to a fourth way economists like to think about entrepreneurship, which is that entrepreneurship plays a big role in helping the economy adapt to change. Research suggests that entrepreneurs and the businesses they create are highly responsive to big economic shocks, and the COVID-19 pandemic was certainly a seismic shock.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;To be sure, the future is uncertain. It is unclear what the productivity effects of the pandemic surge of new businesses, particularly in high tech, will be.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;And whether that surge will continue is an open question; after all, the pre-pandemic period was a period of declining rates of new business creation, and the pandemic surge itself does appear to be cooling off recently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />For now, let me say that I am grateful that entrepreneurs continue to give us a hand in meeting our employment mandate, and whatever productivity gains we may reap in coming years as a result may help ease tradeoffs with inflation as well.</p>
<p>Finally, I will share one last story about why South Carolina will always hold a special place in my and my sisters' hearts. Every summer and at Thanksgiving, we would travel through the Palmetto State to our grandparents' house in Winston-Salem. Sitting in the back seat of the station wagon, we were entranced by the many colorful signs along Interstate 95 advertising what I, as a child, viewed as South Carolina's number one attraction: the South of the Border roadside amusement park. We begged our parents to stop every time. It was an epic struggle that went on for more than a decade. Once or twice they did relent, a sweet childhood victory! And here is the funny thing about travels&mdash;paths can cross. The timing is such that my sisters and I may have even been helped by a waiter named Ben, a young man from Dillon, South Carolina, who would go on to be Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke!<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></span>&nbsp;Perhaps it was the world's way of foreshadowing.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me here in Charleston. It is inspiring to meet this group of bold, entrepreneurial women in South Carolina, and I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>

<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. There is no single way to measure the number of self-employed individuals and related businesses, but it certainly numbers in the millions. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey indicates there are roughly 10 million unincorporated and 7 million incorporated self-employed individuals. Separate data on businesses from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that, as of 2021, there were about 25 million nonemployer and 800,000 employer sole proprietorships (<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nonemployer-statistics.html">Nonemployer Statistics</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html">Statistics of U.S. Businesses</a>).</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Gross job creation refers to all jobs created by entering and expanding establishments. Data are from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics, averaged for 2015&ndash;19. New firms' share of net job creation is much higher, but this is partly an artifact of measurement practices: Firms with an age less than one measured in annual data cannot contribute negatively to net job creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. "Business applications" refers to applications for new Employer Identification Numbers submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. These are reported by the U.S. Census Bureau in the Business Formation Statistics. An application does not necessarily mean an actual firm with employees, revenue, or both will result.&nbsp;</p>

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Business Employment Dynamics (BED) report new firm job creation of 1.9 million, on average, in 2022 and 2023, the highest pace since 2007.

The last period of robust productivity growth in the U.S., the late 1990s and early 2000s, was preceded by several years by strong business creation in high-tech industries; see Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, John C.

<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. The number of annual new firms as a share of all firms declined from around 12 percent in the 1980s, on average, to around 9 percent in the period of 2010&ndash;19.

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines TSB £10.9m Over Treatment Of Customers In Financial Difficulty</title>

<div> fined, TSB Bank plc, arrears, controls, redress
Summary:<br />TSB Bank plc fined £10,910,500 for unfair treatment of customers in arrears, lacked suitable controls, paid £99.9m in redress, breached FCA Principles. <br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined TSB Bank plc (TSB) &pound;10,910,500 for failing to ensure customers who were in arrears were treated fairly.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>It also lacked suitable systems and controls to secure fair outcomes. TSB has paid &pound;99.9m in redress to the 232,849 mortgage, overdraft, credit card and loan customers affected.</span></p>
<p>Between June 2014 and March 2020, TSB&rsquo;s inadequate processes created a real risk that repayment plans were not realistic. Its training did not fully support its staff in understanding customers&rsquo; circumstances. Staff were potentially encouraged by incentive schemes to prioritise the number of plans made over taking enough time to assess individual customer circumstances.</p>
<p>As a result of its failings, TSB risked agreeing unaffordable payment arrangements with customers in difficulty or charging them inappropriate fees. This risked increased uncertainty and stress, including for vulnerable customers.</p>
<p>The extent of the failings were identified by an independent review into TSB&rsquo;s treatment of customers who had fallen into arrears, which had been ordered by the FCA in July 2020.</p>
<p>TSB had become aware of potential problems with its collections and recoveries in December 2016. However, it was not until the review in 2020 that TSB took effective action to fully address them.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, commented:</p>
<p>'If you get into difficulty, you hope for &ndash; and we expect &ndash; fair treatment so a stressful situation isn&rsquo;t made worse. TSB&rsquo;s woeful systems and controls exposed its customers to risk of harm and meant it missed opportunity after opportunity to do the right thing. While it did take action, it took us instigating a review before it acted effectively to address all the issues.'</p>
<p>TSB has worked closely with the independent reviewer and the FCA and has concluded a comprehensive programme to resolve these issues, costing &pound;105m. The FCA continues to supervise all firms to ensure that they have suitable processes in place to support struggling customers.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<li>TSB would have been fined &pound;15,586,500 but it agreed to resolve these matters so qualified for a 30% discount under the FCA&rsquo;s processes.</li>
<li>The FCA requested that a Skilled Person be appointed to review TSB&rsquo;s collections and recoveries in September 2019, following concerns raised both during its own supervision work and by TSB itself. This work was carried out between 2020 and 2023.</li>
<li>TSB breached Principles 3 (Management and control) and 6 (Customers' interests) of the FCA&rsquo;s Principles for Business.</li>

<div> launch, financial risks, global financial conditions, policy recommendations, stability

Summary:
The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) report discusses financial risks, global conditions, and policy recommendations for regional stability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The&nbsp;ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) today launched its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.SH2rn1fYDrsFUom0sxl58FhGbWqFSIYaLL4F7TPOgCtWp8pDETO-2F3Ern4JGcBTtj4P4hzbL2D-2BqyfopJRXRuohIOCeszmuIF0VToLDgTtCA-3Dl-4L_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ-2FbfYjrnmw7FS9tH-2Ft9pdIxIDlVc0RCVS1lpR9yQYOBxZqBfK-2Bl1M3bAsJCgy0pMaEB7J86WZsZu7En5jqaO1OcsE418csKCdEZ29qeIXFRQPgmADFmz2VFKnS8llrGhW4d2KK9s4YWNsMPD6qyc29aTfUHOvpwE8qeqvVGMk8ZgqsQC0ry5-2B0F6HsGShevYzmFfJNM5WVZzRViACIEGskAavBz-2FY4sBJnp6X-2BJSmHqQ64f7La9wyMp2TRKMhLh5QNPQXISjae4Xf4OzxQt6WD3qJZJLqyC1DE9HeFxIfPAg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>ASEAN+3 Financial Stability Report (AFSR 2024)</b></a>, which analyzes the latest market developments and potential risks within the ASEAN+3 region, while offering comprehensive analyses on some key challenges confronting the region.&nbsp;Since December 2023, financial risks in the ASEAN+3 region have evolved: while some risks (high inflation, higher for longer interest rate) have subsided, others (geopolitical tensions) have intensified. The region is poised to face a wide range of risks and challenges to financial stability in the near- to long-term.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgfbd2left"><img align="middle" alt="   " id="prnejpgfbd2left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2048913/AMRO_ColorRGB_FA_Logo.jpg" title="   " /></div>
<p>The first half of 2024 experienced an easing in global financial conditions as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) concluded its policy rate hiking cycle. Market movements were primarily influenced by expectations around the Fed's actions. However, in the third quarter of 2024, uncertainties about the US growth outlook, compounded by the unwinding of yen carry trades, sparked notable market volatility. The Fed commenced its monetary easing in September, which has led to an easing of monetary conditions, but uncertainties around inflation and growth outlook linger. Moreover, the geopolitical situation in the Middle East remains fragile and the result of the upcoming US presidential election remains a major source of uncertainties for financial markets.</p>
<p>"Overall, the risk to financial stability across ASEAN+3 in 2024 appears lower than in 2023. The current climate of robust growth and disinflation presents regional policymakers an opportunity to reduce debt, rebuild policy space, and strengthen fiscal capacity to better manage potential shocks. Replenishing foreign exchange reserves during times of capital inflows can further enhance market confidence and provide a buffer against extreme market volatility," said AMRO Chief Economist Hoe Ee Khor.</p>
<p>The thematic studies in AFSR 2024 provide an in-depth analysis of the specific risks confronting the region. ASEAN+3 remains vulnerable to macro-financial shocks from major advanced economies and other external factors, while&nbsp;the growing interconnectivity of ASEAN+3 financial systems underscores the need to take a holistic macroeconomic and financial view of the region to safeguard against systemic risks.</p>
<p>The real estate market downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and high inflation has raised additional concerns, as weakened demand and tighter financial conditions in several economies have severely impacted the financial health of property developers, leading to declining profitability, liquidity, and debt servicing capacity. Robust capital buffers in the banking sector appear to have mitigated spillover risks from the property market, but less visible threats from smaller local banks and shadow banking activities related to the property sector lurk, requiring close monitoring and may necessitate regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>The region's heavy reliance on the US dollar for cross-border financial activities poses two major risks: 1) a potential shortage of US dollar funding, which could destabilize financial markets and intermediaries; and 2) the transmission of global shocks through the US dollar, particularly during periods of monetary tightening or geopolitical tension.</p>
<p><b>Policy recommendations</b></p>
<p>In the near term, ASEAN+3 economies should remain vigilant against the risks of a resurgence of inflation, escalating geopolitical tensions, and a global growth slowdown. Continuous monitoring of international spillovers is crucial, alongside enhancing regional macroeconomic and financial surveillance and cooperation. Critical measures include strengthening cross-border surveillance and data sharing, conducting regional stress testing, enhancing home-host supervision, and strengthening the regional financial safety net.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measures to stabilize the property sector should be implemented to prevent fundamentally sound companies from defaulting due to tight credit conditions&nbsp;driven by a worsening market, while enhancing&nbsp;the soundness&nbsp;of financial institutions&nbsp;with significant exposure, especially smaller banks and nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).</p>
<p>To strengthen resilience against external shocks in a dollar-dependent environment, ASEAN+3 economies should reinforce their economic and financial fundamentals, enhance surveillance frameworks for monitoring US dollar liquidity, fortify macroprudential measures for banks and NBFIs, and provide financing support to member economies experiencing US dollar liquidity stresses. Furthermore, reducing structural reliance on the US dollar in the medium- to long-term by promoting the use of local currencies and developing cross-currency payment systems should be a key priority.</p>
<p>"To tackle the near- to long-term risks and challenges to ASEAN+3's financial stability, the region must come together as one and strive for resilience and stability," emphasized Dr. Khor.</p>

<title>Acuiti And SGX Group Launch Global Derivatives Market Sentiment Index</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acuiti-and-sgx-group-launch-global-derivatives-market-sentiment-index/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acuiti and Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released the SGX Global Market Sentiment Index, a barometer of sentiment from across the global derivatives market.</p>
<p>The Sentiment Index is based on a quarterly poll of Acuiti&rsquo;s Expert Networks, comprising senior, derivatives-focused executives from hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms and the sell-side.</p>
<p>Each quarter, Acuiti surveys Expert Network members on their outlook for the next three months to compile the benchmark. The report also draws on data compiled by Acuiti over the past 12 months to build the historic data.</p>
<p>Going forward, the report will provide a temperature check on sentiment across the market, with an analysis of what is driving change across company types.</p>
<p>This first report found that overall industry sentiment was positive in Q3 2024 with 68% of respondents feeling optimistic about the three months ahead. This was an increase from 65% last quarter.</p>
<p>The increase in optimism was driven by a strengthening of sentiment from the sell-side and proprietary trading firms.</p>
<p>However, for some, particularly asset managers, the volatility experienced during the quarter came as an unwelcome development as fears for performance over the rest of the year dented confidence.</p>
<p>Overall, however, 2024 is shaping up to be another record year for volumes across the global derivatives market and sentiment generally remains positive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with SGX Group to launch the SGX Global Market Sentiment Report. The report aggregates data that we collect from across our global networks and provides in one report a snapshot of sentiment across the derivatives market,&rdquo; says Will Mitting, founder of Acuiti.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For September 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Federal Open Market Committee, interest rate cut, U.S. stock markets, Thai equities, SET Index<br />
Summary:<br />
FOMC announced a rate cut, boosting U.S. stock markets. Thai equities rallied on domestic tailwinds, with SET Index closing at a 6.6% gain. TFEX daily trading volume increased in September. Thai stock market's forward P/E ratio and dividend yield ratio at the end of September. Newly listed companies on SET and mai in September. <div>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 0.5 percentage point cut in its policy interest rate to the target range of 4.75 percent &ndash; 5.0 percent. This marked the first rate cut in over four years, aimed at balancing risks to employment and inflation target. U.S. stock markets reacted positively, signaling that investors no longer expect a recession. Historically, The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts have boosted emerging market equities. Recent foreign capital inflows into ASEAN bourses spurred rallies in most regional stock indices in September, led by Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore, in descending order.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that Thai equities rallied on domestic tailwinds, including a clearer political landscape following the new Prime Minister's appointment, stronger-than-expected Thai economic growth, and increased institutional investment driven by stock market-related measures. This performance coincided with a strong rebound of foreign buying volume, which reached a 22-month high and triggered a rapid appreciation of Thai baht. However, the sensitivity analysis suggests that the currency strength may hurt future earnings forecasts of export and tourism stocks, while domestic pure-plays and import-intensive manufacturers may benefit from lower costs. The SET Index registered a notable upswing with heavy trading volume in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for</b><b> </b><b>September</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2024, the SET Index closed at 1,448.83 points, up 6.6 percent from the previous month - the highest gain since August 2021. The benchmark index rose 2.3 percent from the end of 2023. </li>
<li>Thai stocks rose across the board. For the nine months to September, industry groups that outpaced the SET Index were Technology, Consumer Products, and Agro &amp; Food Industry.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in September 2024 increased 26.4 percent over the same period last year and 35.8 percent from the preceding month to THB 62.5 billion (approx. USD 1.94 billion). For the first nine months of 2024, the daily trading value averaged at THB 46.48 billion.&nbsp; </li>
<li>In September, one newly listed company on SET was Petchsrivichai Enterprise pcl (PCE), and two newly listed on mai were SEI Medical pcl (SEI) and PMC Label Materials pcl (PMC).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of September 2024 was 15.8 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 13.0 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.5 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 15.6 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of September 2024 was 3.28 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.04 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in September 2024 averaged 707,472 contracts, up 41.9 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first nine months of 2024, TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume dropped 13.5 percent over the same period last year to 474,728 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

</div>
<p>Organized on October 2nd in London by The Payment Association, the PAY360 Awards celebrate companies that push technological boundaries in the payments industry. Arf's Silver Award highlights its pioneering efforts to leverage blockchain technology and digital assets to create real-time, on-chain liquidity solutions, driving efficiency and transparency in cross-border payments.</p>
<p>This award reflects Arf's mission to solve global liquidity challenges&nbsp;with compliant, scalable solutions and empower financial institutions with instant and secure access to liquidity. Earlier this year, Arf merged with Huma Finance, integrating its liquidity solutions into Huma's PayFi network. This merger has accelerated growth, with Arf's on-chain liquidity volume surpassing $2 billion and loan volume exceeding $1 billion, further expanding its impact in transforming the global payments landscape.</p>
<p>Ali Erhat Nalbant, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Arf, expressed his contentment with the following statements:</p>
<p>"This award highlights Arf's role in addressing the limitations of traditional fiat systems with our blockchain-powered liquidity solutions. Where fiat struggles with speed and transparency, Arf's on-chain liquidity provides instant, real-time settlements that empower financial institutions to operate globally without the inefficiencies of legacy systems. Our vision is to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance, creating a seamless, more inclusive financial ecosystem for institutions across the world."</p>
<p>The 17th PAY360 Awards, hosted by The Payment Association, honor excellence in categories such as Best Consumer Payments Programme, Best Lending Initiative, and Best Open Banking Initiative. This is Arf's 3rd consecutive award at the PAY360 Awards. Two years ago, Arf won a Silver Award in the "Best Use of Crypto and/or Blockchain in Financial Services" category, and last year, Arf won in the "Best Lending Initiative" category. This year's recognition further solidifies Arf's reputation as a leader in leveraging digital assets to tackle complex financial challenges and drive innovation in cross-border payments.</p>

<div> Keywords: Interbrand, brand value, Apple, automotive brands, luxury brands<br />
Summary: Interbrand's 25-year analysis emphasizes the importance of long-term brand investment, with Apple leading despite a drop and automotive and luxury brands showing resilience. The ranking also sees new entrants and re-entrants. <br /><br />Summary: Over-reliance on short-term tactics overlooks long-term revenue potential; Apple leads despite a drop, automotive brands dominate, luxury brands show resilience, and new entrants join the ranking. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>25 years of Interbrand data shows the financial consequence of focusing on performance marketing over long-term brand investment</b></li>
<li><b>Ferrari (#62) and YouTube (#24) have seen the biggest brand value increase in this year's Best Global Brands ranking</b></li>

<p>Global brand&nbsp;consultancy Interbrand today launched its annual&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.wrLxKGHf-2BZMfLEH6Xvy2ArSC-2BvkHhlFIcSIHhZQQ4Dii6cfNRlsXeMCMFWHLLlb7H15f_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ0Zm7xgpZDmgntgaaDlv19Yj4MGJEXqupF5q0ONFDV0Yz1sE7CcqIumt0B1BEBMvaNlZDPYwKOS6Agyr08YK4HjjNa-2FHw6-2BcTFQZoLS7UuOUFZuNpIVzTzoZzljDpSBFp3DaqcadFtE4bUFEXtsMb-2F3hnB6CRqW8PZQZXQD6CLS0X1g4lWNKd8Ebaq0LecQq0njJjM-2B2fEzYZRHpugMnS1cy066mEeORXPmrY0M43M2l2bzoV73jrnzhtHjbxQ-2Fe7VBT4LXPzh9N9SZ-2BKGCcpqVdAnBWBHp46LPUdejZkXqk-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Best Global Brands</a>&nbsp;ranking, marking a quarter of a century of brand valuation analysis.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpge8ebleft"><img align="middle" alt="Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2024" id="prnejpge8ebleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526717/Interbrand_Best_Global_Brands_2024_Infographic.jpg" title="Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2024" /></div>
<p>Since 2000, Interbrand's longitudinal study has tracked and reported on the value of the world's biggest brands. A quarter century of analysis reveals that while performance marketing tactics can drive short-term financial gains, a lack of investment in long-term brand strategy has left the Best Global Brands with at least $3.5T of unrealized value. For this last year, this equates to $200B of lost revenue.</p>
<p>The cumulative value of the world's most valuable brands has increased 3.4x since Interbrand first published its ranking (from $988B USD to $3.4T USD).</p>
<p>Gonzalo Bruj&oacute;, Global CEO, Interbrand said: "If these brands had been treated and managed as strategic growth assets, then this table could be worth as much as $6.9T. The growth we see hides a staggering missed opportunity."</p>
<p><b>Apple holds the top spot</b></p>
<p>Apple remains the most valuable brand, but its brand value has dropped for the first time in over two decades (-3%).</p>
<p>Commenting on Apple, Greg Silverman, Global Director of Brand Economics, Interbrand said: "While others rushed into AI, Apple took a more deliberate path to ensure its AI releases matched its values. This slower-moving act of leadership has put long-term trust ahead of short-term revenue gains. Following these brand moves, Apple's stock has moved up 20% YTD and we anticipate that Apple's value will increase in the 2025 rankings."</p>
<p><b>Automotive brands dominate 2024</b></p>
<p>14 of the top 100 brands of 2024 are automotive, making up more than any other sector in the ranking. Three auto brands &ndash; Toyota (#6), Mercedes-Benz (#8) and BMW (#10) &ndash; appear in the top 10. However, not all auto brands have achieved such success. Tesla (#12) has one of this year's largest declines in brand value (-9%). Meanwhile, Kia (#86), Hyundai (#30) and Toyota (#6) achieved double digit growth.</p>
<p><b>Top-tier luxury shows resilience through innovation</b></p>
<p>Luxury's brand value continued an upward trajectory (+7%, up from + 6.5% last year), extending relevance by creating new consumer experiences and expanded digital touchpoints, demonstrating powerful creativity that taps into the human condition.</p>
<p>Ferrari (#62) captured this year's spot as the top-rising brand, with +21% brand value growth. Louis Vuitton jumped three places (#14 to #11) with Herm&egrave;s (#22) and Prada (#83) two of the biggest luxury brand risers this year, seeing brand value growth of +15% and +14% respectively.</p>
<p><b>Meet the 2024 new entrants</b></p>
<p>Nvidia (#36), Pandora (#91), Range Rover (#96), and Jordan (#99) are this year's new entrants &ndash; and Jordan is the first personality brand to make it onto the table. Uber (#78) and LG (#97) re-enter.</p>
<p><b>Marketing landscape changes over 25 years</b></p>
<p>Over the past 25 years, Interbrand has observed a significant shift in the ways company boardrooms approach growth. C-Suites are prioritizing lower total investments with more immediate returns. Strategies that integrate long-term brand equity with short-term revenue gains are becoming the gold standard &ndash; but these strategies are still surprisingly rare.</p>
<p>Bruj&oacute; said: "Performance tools, capabilities and systems have evolved over the past quarter century. As these tools shift, so do the pressures and expectations placed on brand and marketing leaders. Today, CMOs are expected to deliver greater revenue returns, in shorter time frames, for a&nbsp;lower investment.</p>
<p>"Many of the world's most valuable brands are missing out on significant earning potential by over-investing in short-term gains. Our analysis shows these gains, when tied predominantly to short-term tactics, can undermine a company's mid- to long-term revenue potential."</p>

<p>"Investors have long utilized VIX options and VIX futures to help hedge and manage volatility exposure, and Cboe is proud to expand our volatility product suite at such a critical time," said Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "With its options-on-futures structure, the new Options on VIX Futures will look to meet growing customer demand as Cboe works to provide an efficient and seamless experience to both existing and new CFE market participants. The launch will complement our existing volatility offerings, including the recently launched Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance futures, and enable more investors with the ability to help manage volatility and risk through the election season and beyond."</p>
<p>"20 years after Cboe launched VIX futures, followed by VIX options, and helped establish volatility as an asset class, we continue to prioritize product innovation, engage with our customers and bring new exchange-traded volatility derivatives to market," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "We believe there is a strong demand for risk management tools, especially as investors prepare for the upcoming election and the recent change in the Fed's monetary policy. We've seen a shift in how investors are using options on a day-to-day basis, and with Options on VIX Futures having a mid-curve structure and the ability to offer short-term exposure, investors are expected to be able to manage short-term volatility with greater precision."</p>
<p>Christine Hansen, CEO at IMC US, said: "We are proud to support the expansion of listed volatility offerings from Cboe to meet the varying needs of investors"</p>
<p>Tom Chlada, Chief Operating Officer at Prime Trading, said: "Prime's investment philosophy is to protect and grow capital, and Cboe's new Options on VIX Futures will be a very welcomed addition to our toolkit, enabling us to better express views on volatility and fine-tune our risk management approach. We believe the new options will help boost participation and trading opportunities in the volatility space, and we look forward to incorporating this tool in our portfolios."</p>
<p>Keith DeCarlucci, Chief Investment Officer at Melqart KEAL Macro Fund, said: "VIX futures and options play an important role when managing portfolios, and we welcome Cboe's further expansion of its exchange-traded volatility tools with Options on VIX Futures. Combined with the recent variance futures launch, we have two new products to leverage."</p>
<p>Options on VIX futures will have European-style exercise, P.M. settlement and physically settle into front-month VIX future. At launch, CFE will list contract expirations for every day the week of October 21 with two additional Friday expirations. Each weekday beginning October 21, CFE plans to list a new contract for trading expiring on the same weekday in the week or weeks following.</p>
<p>The contracts will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and cleared by The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC).</p>
<p>The upcoming launch of Options on VIX Futures follows the recent launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4274862-1&amp;h=3145069619&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Ftradable_products%2Fvariance_futures%2F&amp;a=Cboe+S%26P+500+Variance+(VA)+futures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures</a>, which are designed to offer a streamlined approach to trading the spread between implied and realized volatility. Both products add to Cboe's existing volatility suite and provide investors with exchange-traded solutions to manage market volatility ahead of and following the U.S. election.</p>
<p>On Friday, October 11 at 8:30 am ET, Cboe will be hosting a webinar with speakers from Allspring Global, IMC Financial Markets, and Golden Horse Fund Management on how Options on VIX Futures can enhance trading ease and accessibility. To register for the webinar, please&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4274862-1&amp;h=1124207522&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2F6217271956347%2FWN_Rg95Lf3vQpigZP5lca4c_g&amp;a=click+here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<title>SEC Charges Three So-Called Market Makers And Nine Individuals In Crackdown On Manipulation Of Crypto Assets Offered And Sold As Securities</title>

<div> fraud charges, market manipulation, crypto assets, securities, retail investors
Summary: SEC announces fraud charges against companies and individuals for manipulating markets for crypto assets offered as securities to retail investors. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against three companies purporting to be market makers and nine individuals for engaging in schemes to manipulate the markets for various crypto assets being offered and sold as securities to retail investors. As alleged, the schemes were intended to induce investor victims to purchase the crypto assets by creating the false appearance of an active trading market for them.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaints, crypto asset promoters Russell Armand, Maxwell Hernandez, Manpreet Singh Kohli, Nam Tran, and Vy Pham (Promoters) hired so-called market makers ZM Quant and Gotbit to provide market-manipulation-as-a-service, which included generating artificial trading volume or manipulating the price of crypto assets that the Promoters offered and sold as securities to retail investors in unregistered transactions. The SEC also alleged that ZM Quant and a third so-called market maker, CLS Global, undertook similar schemes to manipulate the market of a crypto asset offered and sold as a security that was created at the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of its parallel investigation into potential market manipulation in the crypto asset industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s enforcement actions demonstrate, once more, that retail investors are being victimized by fraudulent activity by institutional actors in the markets for crypto assets,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;With purported promoters and self-anointed market makers teaming up to target the investing public with false promises of profits in the crypto markets, investors should be mindful that the deck may be stacked against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that ZM Quant and its employees Baijun Ou and Ruiqi Lau, Gotbit and its employee Fedor Kedrov, and CLS Global and its employee Andrey Zhorzhes manipulated markets on behalf of the Promoters by self-trading (commonly referred to as &ldquo;wash trading&rdquo;) on popular crypto asset trading platforms or by engaging in other trading practices that likewise served no economic purpose, and that they used algorithms (or bots) that, at times, generated quadrillions of transactions and billions of dollars of artificial trading volume each day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remain concerned about the ease with which the market for a crypto asset can be manipulated and are committed to rooting out instances of such misconduct when it involves securities,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit (CACU). &ldquo;The wrongdoers behind these schemes are profiting handsomely at the expense of investors that have been deceptively lured into these markets and lost their hard-earned savings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s five complaints, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, allege that all defendants violated the antifraud and market manipulation provisions of the securities laws and that certain defendants violated registration provisions. The complaints seek permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties against all the defendants, as well as officer and director bars against certain defendants. Armand, Hernandez, and Pham consented to bifurcated settlements, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining them from further violations of the federal securities laws, subjecting them to conduct-based injunctions, and barring them from acting as officers or directors. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and any civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, which today announced parallel criminal actions.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations were conducted by David D&rsquo;Addio, Amy Harman Burkart, Ivan Panchenko, Jeffrey Cook, and John McCann in the SEC&rsquo;s Boston Regional Office, as well as Colin Missett and Joy Guo of the CACU. They were supervised by Amy Gwiazda, Michael Brennan, Donald Battle, and Mr. Tenreiro of CACU and by Celia Moore and John T. Dugan of the Boston Regional Office. The team also thanks the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology for their assistance. The litigations will be led by Mr. D&rsquo;Addio and Ms. Burkart.</p>

<title>SEC Charges “Magic Mushroom” Company And Two Individuals With Multimillion Dollar Pump-And-Dump Scheme</title>

<div> SEC, Minerco Inc., pump-and-dump scheme, fraudulent activities, stock manipulation <br />
Summary: SEC charges Minerco Inc., Shumake, and Jenge for pump-and-dump scheme, defrauding investors, false statements, seeks injunctions and penalties.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Minerco Inc. (former over-the-counter ticker: MINE), Bobby Shumake Japhia, and Julius Makiri Jenge, for their roles in an alleged pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors out of approximately $8 million while generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten proceeds from sales of Minerco stock.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, in the fall of 2019, Shumake, who was formerly known as Robert Samuel Shumake, Jr., secretly gained control of a large stock position in Minerco, an inactive penny stock company, and then arranged for Jenge to assume control of Minerco. The defendants then began pumping Minerco&rsquo;s stock price by promoting Minerco as the &ldquo;first publicly traded company focused on the research, production, and distribution of psilocybin mushrooms.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/psilocybin">Psilocybin</a>&nbsp;is the principal psychoactive component in &ldquo;magic mushrooms,&rdquo; a plant-based hallucinogen.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2021, the defendants allegedly continued to pump Minerco stock by making public statements and disclosures that contained false and misleading information. For example, Shumake and Minerco allegedly issued press releases falsely suggesting that an independent third party had valued Minerco at $1 billion and that Minerco had partnered with a Jamaican company that would lend expertise in growing a unique strain of psilocybin and bequeath to Minerco its Jamaican cannabis licenses. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleges that Jenge and Minerco falsely claimed in public disclosures that Minerco was an active Nevada company when, in reality, its charter had been revoked. Finally, Shumake allegedly engaged an offshore company to &ldquo;dump&rdquo; his Minerco shares and ultimately transfer at least $3.4 million in ill-gotten gains to an entity Shumake controlled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged here, pump-and-dumps often begin when cheap stock of dormant companies is suddenly touted by a promoter as the next big thing,&rdquo; said Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action serves as an important reminder that the SEC will remain steadfast in its efforts to root out of the market stock offerings that are more about hype than substance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC previously obtained an Order compelling Jenge to produce documents and appear for testimony pursuant to an investigative subpoena issued by the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Minerco, Shumake, and Jenge with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties against each defendant, as well as conduct-based injunctions and penny stock and officer-and-director bars against Shumake and Jenge.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by Adam Eisner, Brittany Garmyn, Keith O&rsquo;Donnell, and Zachary Scrima and supervised by C. Joshua Felker and Ms. Hodgman. Damon Taaffe will lead the litigation team under the supervision of David Nasse. The SEC appreciates the assistance of FINRA, OTC Markets Group, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Jamaica Financial Services Commission, the Qu&eacute;bec Autorit&eacute; des March&eacute;s Financiers, the Capital Markets Board of T&uuml;rkiye, and the Belize Financial Services Commission.</p>
<p>The SEC encourages investors to take&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-0">certain steps to identify</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/pump-and-dump-schemes">pump-and-dump schemes</a>&nbsp;involving the stocks of dormant shell companies.</p>

<div> report, OSC, gamification, investors, trading simulation<br />
<br />
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) released a report on the impact of gamification on investors, launching a trading simulation tool to test online trading behaviors. Summary: OSC report on gamification impact, new trading tool, social engagement influences behavior, findings guide regulatory response.<br /> <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today released a new report that studied the impact of gamification on investors. Along with this research, the OSC launched a new trading simulation tool for investors to test how online gamification tactics can influence their investing behaviour.</p>
<p>The report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/gamification-revisited-new-experimental-findings-retail-investing">Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span>&nbsp;looks at whether promoting certain assets on digital investing platforms presents a risk to investors. The tool,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://getsmarterabouttrading.ca/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">GetSmarterAboutTrading.ca<span>&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">provides people with a chance to participate in a simulated stock market and practice online trading. It exposes users to gamification techniques to show them what could be influencing their investing behaviour.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Digital investing platforms are increasingly popular and make it easier for retail investors to participate in financial markets, but there is growing regulatory concern over the use of gamification techniques on these platforms,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;The research we published today, along with the GetSmarterAboutTrading tool will help people better understand the impact of gamification techniques on their trading behaviour and help investors make more informed decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OSC conducted an experiment where participants received virtual &ldquo;money&rdquo; to invest in fictional stocks on a made-up trading platform. Participants took part in simulated trading where stocks were promoted in different ways. The research found two types of promotion had a significant impact on participants&rsquo; trading behaviours; those who saw promoted stocks featured on a social feed traded 12% more in those stocks, and those who had the option to copy the trades of a &ldquo;high performing&rdquo; user traded 18% more in the promoted stocks.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that these social engagement techniques can influence investor behaviours by encouraging trading in specific assets. This influence is likely to have a negative impact, potentially through under-diversification or excessive risk taking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/gamification-revisited-new-experimental-findings-retail-investing">Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</a>&nbsp;builds on the work of an earlier OSC research report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-796/digital-engagement-practices-retail-investing-gamification-other-behavioural-techniques"><em>Digital Engagement Practices in Retail Investing: Gamification and Other Behavioural Techniques</em></a><em>.</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The 2022 report included the results of an online experiment showing the impact of &ldquo;points&rdquo; and &ldquo;top-traded lists&rdquo; on user trading.The experiment found participants rewarded with points for buying and selling stocks made 39% more trades and those who saw a list of top traded stocks were 14% more likely to buy and sell those stocks. More frequent trading generally has a negative impact on investor returns.</p>
<p>The OSC&rsquo;s research into gamification is an important example of taking evidence-informed approaches to securities regulation. This report also contains several recommendations for how regulators and authorities in Canada and abroad might respond to the ongoing use of digital engagement practices by online investing platforms. This could include updates to regulations and guidance for digital trading platforms and potentially limiting problematic digital engagement practices that research indicates can compromise investor protection.</p>
<p>October marks Investor Education Month in Canada, and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/?p=home" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">World Investor Week</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>a global initiative of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, takes place October 7-13. Today&rsquo;s launch is part of OSC efforts to raise awareness about the importance of investor education and protection.</p>

<div> Guidelines, redemption, token holders, crisis, issuer
Summary: 
The EBA published final Guidelines on token holder redemption in issuer crises, covering ARTs and EMTs, with amendments for clarity and flexibility. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Guidelines on the orderly redemption of token holders in case of crisis of the issuer. The Guidelines, which are addressed to competent authorities designated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), cover issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and of e-money tokens (EMTs).</span></p>
<p>The Guidelines&nbsp;specify the content of the redemption plan to be developed by issuers of ARTs and EMTs in going concern, including the liquidation strategies of the reserve of assets, the mapping of critical activities, the content of the redemption claims, the main steps of the redemption process, and the elements that may lead to the trigger of the plan by the competent authority.</p>
<p>Considering the feedback received during the public consultation, a&nbsp;few targeted amendments have been made to streamline the wording and provide further clarity on some specific aspects. For instance, some clarifications allow for flexibility so that the guidance addressed to issuers of ARTs relating to the liquidation of the reserve of assets can be used, to some extent, also by issuers of EMTs.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The Guidelines on redemption plans&nbsp;have been developed according to Article 47(5) of MiCAR. By virtue of the cross-reference set out in Article 55 MiCAR, the Guidelines also cover&nbsp;issuers of e-money tokens, as applicable.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Federal Reserve, discount window, monetary policy, primary credit, economy <br />
<br />Summary: The article discusses the historical perspective and evolution of the discount window, recent changes, outreach efforts, technology enhancements, and future steps. <div>
<p>Thank you, Steve, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>Yesterday I shared my historical perspective on the discount window at Davidson College.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In 1913, when the Federal Reserve was established, the discount window was the main tool it used to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. More than 110 years later, the discount window continues to play an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and the effective implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today I would like to discuss with you how the discount window has evolved in the 21st century, including recent steps the Federal Reserve Board has taken to solicit feedback from the public on discount window operations. Before I address our most recent efforts, however, I will review some important episodes in discount window history that brought us to where we are today.</p>
<p>First, I will recount briefly events in the 1980s and early 1990s that provide important context for the reappraisal of the discount window in the early 2000s. Second, I will summarize revisions to the discount window that the Fed made in 2003 and some additional changes made since then. Third, I will describe efforts that the Fed has taken to ensure that the discount window remains effective today, including the request for information that the Board recently issued on operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit. After completing my discussion of the discount window, I will conclude with my outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>Events before the 2003 Discount Window Revisions</strong><br />I would like to pick up today where I left off yesterday in my speech at Davidson College: the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a period of widespread problems in the commercial banking sector. Troubled institutions borrowed from the discount window for extended periods of time as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the closure of these institutions. As a result, the discount window became associated strongly with lending to troubled institutions. Healthy banks' reluctance to borrow from the discount window increased. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This led to a reassessment of the discount window in the early 2000s and to eventual revisions implemented in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>A Reassessment of the Discount Window in the Early 2000s</strong><br />The key challenge in the reassessment of the discount window was to establish a lending program that would not only operate effectively and support monetary policy implementation, but also mitigate moral hazard and provide sufficient controls to minimize risk to Reserve Banks and, ultimately, to American taxpayers. After the reassessment, the Fed implemented several changes aimed to achieve the right balance.</p>
<p>The Board replaced the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a below-market rate, with a new type of discount window credit called primary credit. This new type of discount window credit became effective in 2003.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It is available as a backup source of liquidity to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition at an above-market rate. Making the discount rate a penalty rate is more consistent with the long-standing practice of other major central banks. This feature was intended to reduce the need for administrative pressures based on Reserve Bank staff judgment of inappropriate usage when the discount rate was below market rates. Although those measures effectively limited usage that was deemed inappropriate at the time, they also presented communication challenges regarding when it was appropriate to use the discount window and perpetuated the perception that the Fed discouraged its use.</p>
<p>Primary credit is a "no questions asked" facility in which eligible depository institutions are no longer required to have exhausted other sources of funding or be subject to restrictions on the use of the borrowed funds. The Fed initially set the primary credit rate 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Since March 2020, the Fed has set the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>At the same time primary credit was established, another new program, called secondary credit, replaced the extended credit program. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It was initially available at an interest rate 50 basis points higher than the primary credit rate, which is the spread in effect today. In contrast to primary credit, extensions under secondary credit are subject to higher collateral discounts and may involve ongoing oversight on the use of funds obtained under the program, reflecting the less-sound condition of secondary credit borrowers. Typically, Reserve Banks review a depository institution's plan to repay the loan and return to market sources of funding.</p>
<p>This two-tiered structure of providing the no-questions-asked primary credit program for healthy depository institutions and the secondary credit program for less-than-healthy depository institutions was designed primarily to instill public confidence in the health of institutions borrowing from the primary credit program and to reduce the reluctance of healthy depository institutions to borrow.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In addition, having two separate facilities would reinforce the notion that healthy and troubled depository institutions alike should regard borrowing from the Fed as an option in the event of a need for additional funds.</p>
<p>In the early years of the switch to the new facilities, there were signs that healthy depository institutions became more willing to borrow from the discount window. For example, some research found that after the 2003 discount window revisions, banks borrowed more from the discount window when the federal funds rate spiked than they had previously.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This finding suggests that the redesign of the discount window was effective in reducing banks' reluctance to borrow. As a result, the discount window may have been more effective in placing a ceiling on short-term funding rates, aiding the implementation of monetary policy, and serving as a liquidity tool when needed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to measure reluctance to borrow from the discount window. When the interest rate on primary credit is above the target federal funds rate and the federal funds rate is close to its target, the aggregate volume of primary credit is expected to be low. In other words, a low average level of discount window borrowing does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow; instead, it could simply reflect a situation in which depository institutions do not currently need to borrow. In addition, when there is an abundance of liquidity in the banking system, as is the case in the current ample-reserves monetary policy regime, depository institutions may have less need to obtain additional liquidity via the discount window. Again, this does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow. Conversely, the presence of discount window borrowing does not necessarily reflect the absence of a reluctance to borrow. It could be the case that, although aggregate usage increases, there are still some depository institutions that are willing to pay well above the primary credit rate even when they could have borrowed readily from the discount window. For these reasons, it is important that we complement data with market outreach information to assess the effectiveness of the discount window.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and Challenges since the Introduction of Primary and Secondary Credit</strong><br />Primary and secondary credit exist today, but some changes have been made to primary credit since its inception. For example, although the discount window was used extensively and played an important role in the emergency measures taken during the financial crisis of 2007&ndash;09, some depository institutions during this period still were willing to borrow funds from the market at rates above the discount rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This suggested that there was a reluctance to borrow before the crisis, and that reluctance appeared to grow over the course of the crisis. To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets and provide depository institutions with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding, the Board approved temporary changes to its primary credit discount window facility during the crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in late 2007, the Board established the Term Auction Facility (TAF).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Concerns about lending to troubled depository institutions reemerged after the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 2010, Congress required the Fed to publish detailed individual institution borrowing data with a two-year lag.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This action was intended to enhance the transparency and accountability of Federal Reserve lending while still preserving a measure of confidentiality to avoid discouraging depository institutions from borrowing.</p>
<p>More recently, in March 2020, the Fed announced changes to the provision of primary credit that were intended to encourage depository institutions to use the discount window to meet demands for credit from households and businesses in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes included setting the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the federal funds target range&mdash;a step that enhanced the ability of the discount window to support trading within the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate&mdash;and communicating the terms of borrowing as 90 days, prepayable and renewable on a daily basis. To further encourage depository institutions to use the discount window, the Fed also made changes to its reporting of Reserve Bank&ndash;level aggregate weekly discount window borrowing. It consolidated amounts previously reported as "loans," which include discount window borrowing, into a broader category of assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The changes made in 2020 remain in effect.</p>
<p>During and after the spring 2023 stress events, the discount window again played an important role in supporting both monetary policy and financial stability. Depository institutions that came under severe stress turned to the discount window. The discount window also served an important role in providing ready access to funding, especially for depository institutions experiencing spillovers from the bank failures. To further ensure that depository institutions had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, the Board announced the creation of a new emergency program, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). Although the BTFP was established pursuant to the Board's emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the BTFP used the discount window infrastructure to lend to eligible depository institution borrowers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;By relying on the existing discount window infrastructure, the BTFP was able to begin operating right away. The program ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024, as scheduled.</p>
<p>Today the discount window continues to be an effective tool, but it is important to acknowledge that economic and banking conditions continue to evolve. Since the 2003 discount window reassessment, we have seen an increased focus on liquidity in banking regulation, including the advent of quantitative liquidity requirements for large banking organizations; technological changes in the banking system; a general trend toward faster and 24-7-365 payment systems; changes in the composition and posture of Federal Home Loan Bank lending; and the move to an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve System has taken important steps to ensure that the discount window performs its functions successfully in the 21st-century economy. For example, last year the Board, along with the other federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration, issued guidance on contingency funding plans that encouraged depository institutions to be ready to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;This includes taking steps to establish borrowing relationships with the Federal Reserve, such as providing certain legal documentation and ensuring that collateral to secure loans is ready to pledge. In connection with interagency initiatives, Reserve Banks have conducted outreach to depository institutions and made efforts to guide them in using the discount window.</p>
<p>Data suggest that this encouragement is working. By the end of 2023, 3,900 banks, or roughly 80 percent of all banks, had completed the legal documentation required to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Of those, nearly 2,000 banks had pledged collateral, with an aggregate lendable value of over $2.6 trillion after applying appropriate discounts. These figures are notably above their levels at the end of 2021 and 2022. Although I am pleased to see the improvements in discount window readiness statistics, continued outreach is still important. To that effect, this summer, Federal Reserve Banks hosted an Ask the Fed&reg; session to discuss the purpose of the discount window, its facilities, and recommendations for depository institutions on how to prepare to borrow from the Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Reserve System has made important investments to enhance the technology that supports discount window activities. Earlier this year, the System launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to request and prepay loans as well as securely message their local Reserve Bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Discount Window Direct generally is accessible 24 hours a day. We are actively encouraging the use of Discount Window Direct.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking Feedback on the Discount Window</strong><br />To complement our efforts to enhance discount window operations, the Federal Reserve Board recently announced that it is collecting feedback from the public on operational frictions associated with the discount window and intraday credit through the issuance of a request for information. As some of you may know, a request for information is a formal document through which a government agency solicits feedback. Members of the public can submit comments in response to the request for information until December 9, 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a></p>
<p>The Board requests input on various discount window and intraday credit operational practices, such as the process for requesting, receiving, and repaying discount window loans as well as Reserve Bank discount window and intraday credit communications practices. Through the request for information, the Board hopes to gain further insight into the operational aspects that are the most costly or burdensome for depository institutions. This will help the Fed consider further improvements to promote efficiency and reduce burden on depository institutions. Ultimately, the Fed's goal is to build on the current discount window operations and processes so that the discount window will continue to provide ready access to funding against a wide range of collateral in the future. I encourage members of the public to submit comments on the request for information, and I look forward to considering the feedback that we receive.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />Before concluding, let me share with you a summary of my outlook for the U.S. economy, as I did yesterday with the audience at Davidson. Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Jefferson (2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For more details about this period, see Clouse (1994). In response to the wave of depository institution failures, Congress placed legal limitations on Federal Reserve lending to troubled institutions. Specifically, section 142 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) amended section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act to place restraints on discount window lending to undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized insured depository institutions. FDICIA also imposed liability on the Board of Governors for excess losses incurred by the FDIC that are attributable to lending beyond those limits. The provisions of FDICIA were intended to reduce moral hazard in the banking system and limit taxpayer losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For more details, see the October 31, 2002, Federal Reserve press release (Board of Governors, 2002b) and the final rule implementing the changes (Board of Governors, 2002a).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In 2003, when primary credit was implemented, there was a single federal funds target rate. The Federal Open Market Committee adopted a federal funds target range on December 16, 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For details on the change to the rate spread announced in March 2020, see the press release (Board of Governors, 2020). As will be discussed in greater detail later, before 2020, the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate (or top of the target range) had changed a few times to address economic conditions during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. This design feature also would help Reserve Banks manage risk more easily by establishing a standardized approach and risk controls when lending through a facility reserved for troubled depository institutions. Loans to troubled depository institutions entail more risk to the lending Reserve Bank, and depository institutions that are undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized are subject to lending limitations under FDICIA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. See Artu&ccedil; and Demiralp (2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See Bernanke (2009a) and Madigan (2009) for a retrospective that elaborates on some of the emergency measures taken during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the reasoning for discount window rate changes during the financial crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Throughout this crisis, the Board approved numerous reductions in the primary credit rate and narrowed the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate twice. With the narrowing of the spread in August 2007 from 100 basis points to 50 basis points and in March 2008 to 25 basis points, the Board announced that the maximum term for primary credit loans would be extended, first to 30 days and then to 90 days, respectively. As economic conditions improved, in 2010, the Board increased the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate to 50 basis points and shortened the maximum term for primary credit loans to overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. The TAF provided fixed quantities of term credit to depository institutions through an auction mechanism and seemed to have largely addressed banks' concern that borrowing from the Federal Reserve would imply weakness. According to Bernanke (2009b, paragraph 7), this was "partly because the sizable number of borrowers provides a greater assurance of anonymity, and possibly also because the three-day period between the auction and auction settlement suggests that the facility's users are not using it to meet acute funding needs on a particular day."&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. See section 1103 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41">Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks</a>," is published weekly. It presents a balance sheet for each Federal Reserve Bank, a consolidated balance sheet for all 12 Reserve Banks, an associated statement that lists the factors affecting reserve balances of depository institutions, and several other tables presenting information on the assets, liabilities, and commitments of the Federal Reserve Banks. For additional details on the consolidation of "loans" into a broader category of assets, see the March 19, 2020, H.4.1 announcement, available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319/">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. As with the discount window, an eligible institution participated in the BTFP through its local Reserve Bank. The legal agreements and process for pledging securities in the BTFP also relied on those used in discount window lending. Nevertheless, the BTFP differed from the discount window in various ways, including the term of lending, scope of eligible collateral, collateral valuation, and interest rate. For more information on the differences between the BTFP and the discount window, see the response to question A.3 in Board of Governors (2024a, p. 3). For additional details on the BTFP, see the March 12, 2023, press release (Board of Governors, 2023).&nbsp;</p>

<div> Report, Investor Education, Crypto-Assets, Risks, Regulation
<br />
IOSCO released a report on crypto-asset investor education. It highlights risks, regulatory changes, and the need for financial literacy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>IOSCO is pleased to release its Final Report on Investor Education surrounding Crypto-Assets. This Report summarizes the results of a survey distributed to members of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee for Retail Investors (C8) in autumn last year about retail investor behaviour, demographics, and experiences with crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Crypto-assets have been a key priority for IOSCO for some time and in 2022 it established a Board-level FinTech Task Force to develop, oversee, deliver and implement IOSCO&rsquo;s work with respect to FinTech and crypto-assets. Early work has shown that investors are drawn to invest in crypto-assets for three key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of missing out&rdquo;      (&ldquo;FOMO&rdquo;) or as a speculative investment;</li>
<li>Low cost of entry; and</li>
<li>Advice from friends      and/or social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD769.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917581430%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0LGr%2FUUPTFWUWuvBLJfCCSztwgdjVWxYIWvxS%2FIPvug%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Final Report</a> highlights examples of regulatory changes and enforcement activity by C8 members since the <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD668.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917610936%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=PiFrAW5%2B2uHm6z6G9UO6%2BqDc%2BXU7p2pA0C7tjbdiXEQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">related 2020 report</a>, as well as current priority issues around investor education in the crypto-asset space, such as relationship investment scams and the need to communicate with retail investors on, and about, social media.</p>
<p>The Report suggests specific investor education messages which C8 members could consider when driving forward education of crypto-assets in their local jurisdiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Investments in crypto-assets can be      exceptionally risky and these assets are often volatile.</em></li>
<li><em>Investors should be wary of investments      promoted on social media and use skepticism when following &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>Crypto-asset investments might lack basic      investor protections, as those offering crypto-asset investments or      services may not be complying with applicable law, including registration      and licensing requirements.</em></li>
<li><em>Investments offered in compliance with a      jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory framework confers investors with certain      investor protections.</em></li>
<li><em>Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising      popularity of crypto-assets to lure retail investors into scams, often      leading to devastating losses.</em></li>
<li><em>Understanding the nature of investing      generally, including having an investing plan, and understanding risk      tolerance and time horizon, as well as understanding the nature of      investing in crypto-assets, can be critical to overall and long-term      investing success.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO, commented: &ldquo;<em>With such growing widespread interest in crypto-assets, retail investors are subject to unique risks. Market events have shown that the industry carries high levels of volatility, failures, and bad actors causing harm to investors and the markets.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is not surprising, therefore, that crypto-asset education is one of IOSCO&rsquo;s top priorities and forms a big part of this year&rsquo;s World Investor Week, which highlights a number of common challenges that we all face as financial regulators and as financial consumers.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking place over the course of this week, IOSCO&rsquo;s annual World Investor Week is a platform to promote financial education and literacy. <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldinvestorweek.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917627842%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=htx%2F5VgIUb3S92SUDfTE%2F%2F%2FYCzuCRQ58uUsC%2Fypzcek%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Servais added: &ldquo;<em>Financial education is a complementary tool to regulation and supervision to enhance investors&rsquo; awareness, critical sense and rational behaviour. Financial literacy must go hand in hand with appropriate investor protection measures, fair advice, supervision and enforcement of rules.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<div> Eventus, Bitnomial, trade surveillance, financial risk, Bitnomial Exchange<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus and Bitnomial announce partnership for trade surveillance. Bitnomial selects Eventus Validus platform to enhance market surveillance capabilities. Bitnomial Exchange sees record growth. <br />Summary:<br /> <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions,&nbsp;and Bitnomial, Inc. a digital asset derivatives exchange company that operates CFTC regulated exchange, clearinghouse and settlement businesses, today announced that Bitnomial Exchange has selected the Eventus Validus platform for all of its trade surveillance needs. Bitnomial sought a comprehensive, scalable trade surveillance solution as the firm has grown extensively and expanded into new products and business lines.</p>
<p>Bitnomial and Eventus have had a strategic partnership since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">May 2021</span>, when Eventus began providing seamless integration of order and execution flow on behalf of two large futures commission merchant (FCM) clients that are members of the exchange. Bitnomial Exchange's decision to deploy Validus followed a review of both internal trade surveillance capabilities and the offerings of Eventus and other external providers as the exchange decided how best to build on its internal surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Michael Dunn</span>, President of Bitnomial Exchange, commented on the news: "We are thrilled to adopt Eventus' Validus platform to enhance our market surveillance capabilities. This partnership builds on our years of collaboration to support our mutual customers and deliver a secure, transparent and highly efficient trading experience. Integrating Eventus' advanced surveillance tools with our proprietary, in-house surveillance system strengthens our commitment to compliance and transparency, while reinforcing the trust our clients place in Bitnomial Exchange."</p>
<p>Eventus CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Travis Schwab</span>&nbsp;said: "Bitnomial continues to see phenomenal growth as an exchange business that can meet the needs of the most discerning institutional investors. Our extensive experience in digital assets globally, combined with internal markets and regulatory expertise and a best-of-breed solution, all played a role in this selection. We're excited to build on our relationship and serve as a trusted partner supporting Bitnomial's continued growth and the integrity of its markets."</p>
<p>In August, Bitnomial Exchange announced record growth for the quarter ending on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">June 30</span>&nbsp;and over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$130 million</span>&nbsp;in notional value traded during the first half of 2024, representing a 1,081% increase during the same period in 2023. The&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>-based exchange offering physically settled&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;futures and options was founded in 2014 to provide a regulated, secure environment for institutional and professional traders to participate in&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;derivatives markets. Late last year, the CFTC approved Bitnomial's clearinghouse, and the exchange recently introduced Hashrate futures in partnership with Luxor targeting&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;miners.</p>

<title>Validus Launches ISDA Ops To Streamline Management and Monitoring of Complex ISDA Terms - Solution Streamlines Management And Monitoring Of Complex ISDA ATE And CSA Terms Through Flagship Horizon Platform</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> technology, ISDA Ops, risk management, automation, Validus<br />
Summary:<br />
Validus introduces ISDA Ops for automated ISDA ATE and CSA Threshold calculation, real-time risk management, enhanced reporting, scenario analytics, and integration with existing platforms. <div>
<p>Validus Risk Management (&lsquo;Validus&rsquo;), a leading independent financial risk advisory and technology firm, has introduced ISDA Ops, a groundbreaking solution aimed at automating the calculation and monitoring of complex ISDA Additional Termination Events (ATEs) and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) Thresholds.</p>
<p>The solution provides an intelligent and scalable approach to constructing ATE and CSA Threshold conditions. The new platform significantly enhances efficiency by simplifying the management of ISDA and CSA terms, offering a streamlined approach for handling counterparty and liquidity risks.</p>
<p>The complexity of monitoring ATEs and CSA Thresholds has historically presented significant challenges for financial institutions. Using Validus&rsquo; proprietary technology, ISDA Ops was developed taking into consideration over 2,000 trading lines across more than 40 major counterparties, providing a monitoring platform, which allows users to analyse and test conditions using live and forecasted data. The tailor-made design of the Expression Builder provides complete flexibility, allowing full customisation and accommodating all possible terms. ISDA Ops empowers real-time proactive decision-making, enabling firms to manage collateral requirements and counterparty risk more effectively.</p>
<p>Key benefits of ISDA Ops include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Automated Tracking and Calculation:</b>&nbsp;ISDA Ops provides automatic calculation and tracking of ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds across all counterparties, ensuring seamless risk management.</li>
<li><b>Real-Time Risk Management:</b>&nbsp;Users can proactively make decisions in real time, significantly improving the management of counterparty and liquidity risks by identifying potential collateral calls early.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Reporting:</b>&nbsp;The platform provides intelligent reporting tools that simplify the process of tracking and updating ISDA terms, boosting transparency.</li>
<li><b>Scenario Analytics:</b>&nbsp;With the ability to test conditions using both live and forecasted data, ISDA Ops enable users to simulate potential future scenarios and proactively address potential risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ISDA Ops integrates with Validus&rsquo; Horizon platform, including RiskView, a configurable hedging monitoring and reporting framework, TradeView, a front-office hedging platform, and PortfolioView, a portfolio-level risk management platform. The new features enable&nbsp;CSA Thresholds to be updated and monitored within RiskView, proactively identifying potential collateral calls, while PortfolioView data is integrated for condition testing.</p>
<p><b>Alain Smith, Head of Client Engagement at Validus Risk Management, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Monitoring and managing ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds are crucial risk management functions but has historically proven a major challenge due to the scale and complexity of the task. ISDA Ops therefore represents a significant breakthrough for risk management teams &ndash; presenting a clear, consolidated view of the data and allowing users to identify breaches and model for future risks.

</ul>
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, has published the results of its annual country classification review for countries monitored by its global equity and fixed income indices.</p>
<h4><span>Fixed Income</span></h4>
<p>FTSE Russell is pleased to announce that&nbsp;<span>South Korea</span>&nbsp;will be reclassified from Market Accessibility 1 to 2, and South Korean government bonds will be added to the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI), effective with November 2025 index profiles and phased in over a one-year period on a quarterly basis. Since being placed on the Watch List in September 2022, several initiatives intended to improve the accessibility of South Korean government bonds for international investors have been implemented by market authorities. Most recently, these efforts have facilitated connectivity with International Central Securities Depositaries in June 2024 for the South Korean bond market and permitted third-party foreign exchange for South Korean won starting in July 2024. Following this confirmatory announcement regarding index inclusion, FTSE Russell encourages global financial market infrastructure providers to continue their readiness activities to support future investment in the South Korean government bond market by WGBI users and leverage the benefits of the market structure reforms. FTSE Russell continues to welcome feedback from index stakeholders on such process to ensure a frictionless inclusion of the South Korea government bond market in the WGBI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nikki Stefanelli, Head of Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Index Policy at FTSE Russell, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We congratulate South Korean market authorities on their efforts to expand and encourage global investment in their local government bond market. FTSE Russell have closely monitored the capital markets reforms that have been implemented by South Korean market authorities over the past two years and their effectiveness in achieving the rigorous accessibility criteria for WGBI inclusion. We look forward to continuing to support the market as it undertakes readiness activities ahead of index inclusion at the end of next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mr. Sang-mok Choi, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Korea comments:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Over the last two years, the South Korean government has announced a series of initiatives to strengthen its capital markets for both domestic and international investors, which have now been successfully implemented. Over this time, we have had a positive engagement with FTSE Russell and international market participants on the impact of these efforts and their ability to facilitate inclusion of South Korean government bonds in the FTSE WGBI, which requires the highest level of market accessibility. We are pleased with the process, and more importantly the outcome with FTSE Russell&rsquo;s decision today.&nbsp; The MOEF are committed to continuing and strengthening its engagement with market participants to ensure a smooth index inclusion starting in November 2025, which will bring a welcomed increase in international investment in our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTSE Russell announces that the Market Accessibility Level for&nbsp;<span>India&nbsp;</span>will be reclassified from 0 to 1, and Indian government bonds will be included in the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI), starting in September 2025. This decision reflects the continued progress in the accessibility of the market for these securities for international investors and the growing importance of the Indian government bond market in mainstream global emerging markets bond portfolios. FTSE Russell thanks the Reserve Bank of India for its continued dialogue and commitment to facilitating international investment in its local market.</p>
<h4><span>Price source change to Tradeweb FTSE closing prices for the US, Eurozone and UK government markets</span></h4>
<p>FTSE Russell are pleased to announce a price source change for US Treasuries, European government bonds and UK Gilts to Tradeweb FTSE Closing Prices, effective March 2025. The change will be effective across all FTSE global fixed income indices, including the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Tradeweb FTSE closing bond prices are based on bid-side and offer-side price quotes supplied by market makers to Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic trading platform for institutional dealer and clients during a pre-determined collection window each day. The closing prices, which are derived from these quotes, offer index users a more representative, transparent and robust approach to valuing fixed income securities. In its role as benchmark administrator for these closing prices, FTSE Russell is in a unique position to ensure they are calculated in line with its rigorous governance standards.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hicks and Tara Boehmler, for the kind introduction.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected, including those in the Davidson College family. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>I am happy to be back at Davidson College. This is a special community. I am bound to it by a shared experience defined not by its length, but by its intensity. As I visited with you today, and as I look around this hall, I see the faces of colleagues who became dear friends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, we spoke often about the unprecedented uncertainty we faced. Amidst that uncertainty, however, we supported each other on this campus. Now, looking back, we can attest that this mutual support was vital. I am grateful to have been amongst you during that unprecedented time. Today, I am proud to see that Davidson is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>I am excited to be here with you this evening and to talk to you about the history of the Federal Reserve's discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The discount window is one of the tools the Fed uses to support the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and to implement monetary policy effectively. It was created in 1913 when the Fed was established. Today, more than 110 years later, this tool continues to play an important role. At the Fed, we always look for ways to improve our tools, including our discount window operations. Recently, the Fed published a request for information document to receive feedback from the public regarding operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Today, I will do three things. First, I will discuss briefly my outlook for the U.S. economy. Second, I will offer my historical perspective on the discount window, starting in 1913 and ending in 2000. Finally, I will provide a few details about the request for information the Fed recently published.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will say more about the discount window when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide3.png" id="fig3">slide 3</a>, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. A shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide4.png" id="fig4">slide 4</a>, the unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide5.png" id="fig5">slide 5</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p><strong>Discount Window History</strong><br /><em>1913: The Fed was established</em><br />Now, I will turn to my perspective on the history of the discount window. Understanding this history is important as we consider ways to ensure the discount window continues to serve effectively in its critical role of providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve.</p>
<p>Before the Federal Reserve was founded, the U.S. experienced frequent financial panics. One example is illustrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide6.png" id="fig6">slide 6</a>&nbsp;with a newspaper clipping from the Rocky Mountain Times printed on July 19, 1893. It depicts panic swirling against banks at a time when bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. The illustration shows how waves of panic hit public confidence, the rocks in the picture, and how banks have a fortress mentality. They stand strong against the panic, but they are not lending, and they are isolated.</p>
<p>Back then, the supply of money to the economy was inelastic in the short term, in part because the monetary system in the U.S. was based on the gold standard. Demand for cash, however, varied over the course of the year and was particularly strong during harvest season, when crops were brought to the market. The surge in demand for cash, combined with the inelastic supply of money in the short term, caused financial conditions to tighten seasonally. The banking system was fairly good at moving money to where it needed to go, but it had little scope to expand the total amount of money available in response to the U.S. economy's needs. So if a shock hit the economy when financial conditions were already tight, then the banking system struggled to provide the extra liquidity needed. Banks would seek to preserve liquidity by reducing their investments and denying loan requests, for example. Depositors, fearful that they might not be able to access their funds when they needed them, would rush to withdraw their money. Of course, that caused the banks to conserve further on liquidity. In some cases, they simply closed their doors until the storm passed. When banks closed their doors, economic activity would contract.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Activity would recover when the banks reopened, but the economic suffering in the meantime was meaningful.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply of money in the economy being inelastic in the short term, two prominent frictions, asymmetric information and externalities, made banks and private markets vulnerable to systemic crises. Here, asymmetric information refers to the fact that customers do not have access to all the information they need to evaluate whether a bank is insolvent, illiquid, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, customers rely on imperfect signals, such as news reports about another bank failing, to decide whether to withdraw their money from their own bank.</p>
<p>Then there are externalities, in the sense that an individual bank may not consider how an innocent bystander may be negatively impacted by its actions. When a financial institution fails, that may lead depositors to withdraw money from other unrelated banks, which may in turn cause those banks to fail. Contagion can transform a single bank failure into a systemic crisis, where many banks fail, credit evaporates, the stock market collapses, the economy enters a recession, and the unemployment rate increases dramatically.</p>
<p>The severe financial panic of 1907 stands out as an example of market failure due to these two prominent frictions. The panic was triggered by a series of bad banking decisions that led to a frenzy of withdrawals caused by asymmetric information and public distrust in the liquidity of the banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Banks in many large cities, including financial centers such as New York and Chicago, simply stopped sending payments outside of their communities. The resulting disruption in the payment system and to the flow of liquidity through the banking system led to a severe, though short-lived, economic contraction. This experience led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This act created the Federal Reserve System, composed of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In 1913, the main monetary policy tool at the Fed's disposal was the discount window. At that time, the Fed did not use open market operations&mdash;the buying and selling of government securities in the open market&mdash;to conduct monetary policy. Instead, the Fed adjusted the money supply by lending directly to banks that needed funds through the discount window. The Fed's ability to provide funds to banks as needed made the money supply of the U.S. more elastic and considerably reduced the seasonal volatility in interest rates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This ability also enabled the Fed to provide stability in times of stress, helping banks that experienced rapid withdrawals to satisfy their customers' demand for liquidity and thereby potentially preventing banking panics.</p>
<p><em>1920s: The Fed began to discourage strongly use of the discount window</em><br />In fact, many researchers have argued that the existence of the Fed's discount window prevented a financial crisis in the early 1920s, when the banking sector came under pressure as the U.S. economy transitioned to a peacetime economy following the end of World War I.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;There had been an agricultural boom during the war and a significant accumulation of debt within that sector. Farmers came under pressure as the prices of agricultural goods dropped from wartime highs. The banks sought to support their customers, and the Fed sought to support the banks. There were serious concerns about the condition of several banks in parts of the country. The Fed's discount window lending provided critical support that saved many banks but also resulted in habitual use of the discount window by some banks during the 1920s.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide7.png" id="fig7">Slide 7</a>&nbsp;shows that as of August 1925, 593 member banks, 6 percent of the total, had been borrowing for a year or more from Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, there were real solvency problems, and several banks failed with discount window loans outstanding. These challenges resulted in the Fed strongly discouraging banks from continuous borrowing from the discount window and the adoption of a policy of encouraging a "reluctance to borrow."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>By 1926, the Fed was explicit that borrowing at the discount window was meant to be short term. As I emphasize in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide8.png" id="fig8">slide 8</a>, the Federal Reserve's annual report for 1926 stated that while continuous borrowing by a member bank may be necessary, depending on local economic conditions, "the funds of the Federal reserve banks are primarily intended to be used in meeting the seasonal and temporary requirements of members, and continuous borrowing by a member bank as a general practice would not be consistent with the intent of the Federal reserve act."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>The late 1920s also highlighted Fed concerns about the purpose of the borrowing. The Fed sought to distinguish between "speculative security loans" and loans for "legitimate business."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;A staff reappraisal of the discount mechanism stated that "[t]he controversy over direct pressure intensified in the latter part of the 1920s as an increasing flow of bank credit went into the stock market."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;In short, the Fed observed that some banks were becoming habitual borrowers from the discount window. It was concerned that an overreliance on discount window borrowings would weaken banks and make them more prone to failure.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, the Fed switched to open market operations as its primary tool for conducting monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That allowed the Fed to determine the aggregate amount of liquidity in the system and to rely on private financial markets to distribute it efficiently. The discount window would thus serve as a safety valve if there was a shock that caused conditions to tighten unexpectedly or if individual banks experienced idiosyncratic shocks or somehow lost access to interbank markets.</p>
<p>The intention of this set-up was for banks to use the discount window to borrow from the Fed only occasionally. Ordinarily and predominantly, financial institutions were supposed to rely on private markets for their funding. This set-up was designed to limit moral hazard&mdash;the possibility that institutions take unnecessary risks when there is no market discipline. This is the key balancing act. The Fed needs to be a reliable backstop to prevent financial crises, but it also needs to minimize moral hazard that comes from always standing ready to provide support.</p>
<p><em>1930s&ndash;1940s: The Great Depression and WWII</em><br />During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the banking system experienced severe stress, including many bank runs. There are many reasons why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems in the banking system in the 1930s. I will highlight only two. First, many banks were insolvent rather than illiquid. Central bank lending is not a fundamental solution in those circumstances. When banks are insolvent, it is important to manage the closure in as orderly a manner as possible. The establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 gave bank regulators increased ability to do that. Relatedly, the challenging experiences of lending to troubled banks in the 1920s likely made the Fed more reluctant to lend in circumstances in which solvency concerns were material. Second, the types of collateral that the Fed was initially able to accept when lending to banks were quite limited.</p>
<p>In response, in the early 1930s Congress expanded the range of banking assets that could serve as collateral for discount window loans and added a variety of new Fed emergency lending authorities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;These new lending authorities were used in the 1930s to help alleviate distress. Some were also used in the early 1940s as the Fed helped support the World War II mobilization effort.</p>
<p>The period following the war was relatively calm. The role of the discount window shifted from addressing distress in the banking system to acting as a safety valve to manage tightness in money markets and support monetary policy operations.</p>
<p><em>1950&ndash;2000: Measures to discourage discount window borrowing</em><br />In March 1951, the U.S. Treasury and the Fed reached an agreement to separate government debt management from the conduct of monetary policy, thereby laying the foundation for the modern Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s, the Fed set the interest rate on discount window loans above market rates. Thus, it served as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate. The Fed continued to discourage extensive use of the discount window, but the relatively high interest rate also made its sustained use less attractive.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the Fed placed greater emphasis on open market operations to set its monetary policy stance. Concurrently, the Fed shifted to a policy of setting the interest rate on discount window loans below the market rates. Because the interest rate no longer deterred use of the window, the Fed turned increasingly to other measures, such as administrative pressures and moral suasion, to limit the frequency with which banks requested loans from the discount window. Indeed, between the late 1920s and the 1980s, the Fed adopted and amended numerous restrictions on discount window borrowing. Whenever discount window usage increased too much, the Fed tightened the restrictions to suppress borrowing.</p>
<p>For example, in the 1950s, the Fed defined appropriate and inappropriate discount window borrowing. In particular, the Board's regulations in 1955 stated that "[u]nder ordinary conditions, the continuous use of Federal Reserve credit by a member bank over a considerable period of time is not regarded as appropriate" and provided more details on how Reserve Banks should evaluate the "purpose" of a credit request.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;By 1973, the Board had made additional changes to its regulations on discount window use and defined three distinct discount window programs: adjustment credit, intended to help depository institutions meet short-term liquidity needs; seasonal credit, intended to help small depository institutions manage liquidity needs that arise from seasonal swings in loans and deposits; and extended credit, intended to help depository institutions that have somewhat longer-term liquidity needs resulting from exceptional circumstances.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Over time, the Board added provisions in its regulations requiring banks to exhaust other sources of funding before using discount window credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in the early 1980s, the Fed levied a surcharge on frequent borrowings by large banks to augment the administrative restrictions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Despite these policies to discourage use of the discount window,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide9.png" id="fig9">slide 9</a>&nbsp;shows that discount window borrowing, adjusted for the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, was notable in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting that the discount window was an important marginal source of funding for banks during that period.</p>
<p>That changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when there were notable solvency problems in the banking industry. During this period, the discount window provided support to troubled institutions, while the FDIC sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the failure of these institutions in an orderly manner. The discount window activity that took place while FDIC resolutions proceeded increased the association between use of the discount window and being a troubled institution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;As a result, banks became more reluctant to borrow from the discount window. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective, both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool. That resulted in a series of efforts by the Fed in the early 2000s to change how the discount window operates. Tomorrow, I will discuss those efforts when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><em>A request for information</em><br />Before closing, I'd like to return to where I began. Understanding the history of the discount window is important as we consider ways to ensure it continues to serve effectively in its critical role in providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve. One way to ensure it continues to serve effectively is to collect feedback from the public.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide10.png" id="fig10">Slide 10</a>&nbsp;provides some touch points on the Board's request for information document. The request for information seeks feedback from the public on a range of operational practices for the discount window and intraday credit, including the collection of legal documents; the process for pledging and withdrawing collateral; the process for requesting, receiving and repaying discount window advances; the extension of intraday credit; and Reserve Bank communications practices. My colleagues and I are looking forward to this feedback to inform potential future enhancements to discount window operations. The period for responding to our request for information ends on December 9, 2024.</p>
<p>Thank you to the event organizers and to the Davidson College community for the opportunity to discuss this important topic with you. It has been such a pleasure to be back on campus.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The discount window is a monetary policy facility where depository institutions can request to borrow money against collateral from the Fed. The term "window" originates with the now obsolete practice of sending a bank representative to a Reserve Bank physical teller window when a bank needed to borrow money. The term "discount" refers to how depository institutions borrow money on a discount basis&mdash;interest amount for the entire loan period (plus other charges, if any) is deducted from the principal at the time a loan is disbursed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The Federal Reserve provides intraday credit to depository institutions to foster a safe and efficient payment system. For more information on intraday credit and the Board's Payment System Risk policy, see "Payment System Risk" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. See, for example, Goodhart (1988).</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Illiquidity is a short-term cash flow problem. An illiquid bank cannot pay its current obligations, such as deposit withdrawals, even though the value of the bank's assets exceeds the value of its liabilities. In other words, illiquidity means the bank does not currently have the resources to meet its current obligations. With a short-term loan, an illiquid bank would be able to pay its obligations. Insolvency is a long-term balance sheet problem. Total obligations of an insolvent bank are larger than its total assets. A short-term loan would not help an insolvent bank. Of course, evaluating the quality of a bank's loan book in real time to determine whether a bank is solvent can be extremely challenging during a crisis. In addition, in some cases, illiquidity caused by large deposit withdrawals can lead banks to sell assets at fire-sale prices that then impairs their solvency. Conversely, concerns about insolvency, even if unfounded, can lead to liquidity problems. In the bank run literature, the connections between liquidity and solvency are a key factor that gives rise to runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The panic of 1907 started in October 1907 when three brothers&mdash;F. Augustus Heinze, Otto Heinze, and Arthur P. Heinze&mdash;as well as Charles W. Morse attempted to manipulate the price of United Copper stock by purchasing a large number of shares of the company. Their plan failed, and the stock price of United Copper collapsed. The collapse led to depositor runs on banks and trust companies associated with the Heinzes and Morse. This included a run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose president was connected to Morse. The Knickerbocker Trust Company failed, and the New York Stock Exchange fell nearly 50 percent from its peak of the previous year in the wake of the failure. See Terrell (2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. To aid its thinking on reforming the monetary system, Congress established the National Monetary Commission. The landmark 24 volume report from the commission provides a rich review of the operations of central banks in other countries, a history of financial crises in the U.S., and an appraisal of the state of the contemporary banking system in the U.S. at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. See "History and Purpose of the Federal Reserve" on the St. Louis Fed's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/history-and-purpose-of-the-fed">https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/history-and-purpose-of-the-fed</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See Miron (1986).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. See, for example, Gorton (1988). Willis (1923) and Board of Governors (1922) also suggest that the Fed prevented a crisis from happening in 1920.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. See Carlson (forthcoming).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. See Shull (1971, pp. 33&ndash;34).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. See Board of Governors (1927, p. 4). In 1926, approximately one-third of all banks in the U.S. were member banks, holding about 60 percent of the total loans and investments for all banks; see Board of Governors (1926). Banks receiving charters from the federal government were required to become members of the Federal Reserve System while banks receiving charters from state governments had the option to become members. Discount window borrowing was originally limited to Federal Reserve System member banks. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 opened the window to all depository institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. See Gorton and Metrick (2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. See Anderson (1971, p. 137). In the statement, "direct pressure" refers to the Fed policy of pressuring banks not to borrow from the window. Congress may have shared some of those concerns, as the Federal Reserve Act was amended in 1933 to include a passage in section 4 requiring Reserve Banks to be careful about speculative uses of the Federal Reserve credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. Open market operations are the purchase or sale of securities (for example, U.S. Treasury bonds) in the open market by the Fed. In modern times, the short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the FOMC. For more information, please refer to "Open Market Operations" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. There are several banking acts that do this, but especially the Banking Act of 1932, the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, and the Banking Act of 1935. Yet one more reason why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems of the banking system in the 1930s is that, during this period, nonmember banks did not have access to the discount window. These banks suffered the most during the Great Depression. The ability of nonmember banks to access the window only changed in 1980 with the Monetary Control Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. After the U.S. entered World War II, the Federal Reserve supported efforts by the Treasury to hold down the cost of financing the war by establishing caps on interest rates on Treasury securities (see, for instance, Meltzer, 2003, Chapter 7). The cap pertaining to longer-term interest rates continued to be in place until the 1951 agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. By 1980, the Board's regulations stated that adjustment credit "generally is available only after reasonable alternative sources of funds, including credit from special industry lenders, such as Federal Home Loan Banks, the National Credit Union Administration's Central Liquidity Facility, and corporate central credit unions have been fully used"; seasonal credit was "available only if similar assistance is not available from other special industry lenders"; and other extended credit was available only "where similar assistance is not reasonably available from other sources, including special industry lenders"; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr045/fr045159/fr045159.pdf">Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 45 Fed. Reg. 54009, 54009-54011 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(Aug. 14, 1980). See also Clouse (1994).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. See Meulendyke (1992).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. A congressional inquiry found that this lending likely increased losses to the deposit insurance funds at the time and led to limitations on the ability of the Federal Reserve to provide loans to troubled depository institutions as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group (RCG) for the Americas met on 7 and 8 October in Santiago. The meeting was hosted by the Central Bank of Chile and the Financial Market Commission. FSB Chair, Klaas Knot, joined RCG members for the meeting.</p>
<p>On the first day, members took part in a workshop on macroprudential frameworks and discussed the interaction between micro and macroprudential policies and the institutional arrangements needed for their consistent and effective implementation. Members stressed the importance of coordination and collaboration between financial authorities to respond to financial risks in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>On the second day, members discussed recent developments and shared their thoughts on vulnerabilities they were monitoring in their jurisdictions, including heightened volatility and asset repricing risks. Members exchanged views on potential implications of recent monetary easing on capital flows and exchange rates in the region. Severe weather events have increased in frequency and intensity in the Americas. The group discussed the availability and affordability of climate and natural catastrophe insurance in the region, and implications for financial stability. Members discussed their work to strengthen the reliability and comparability of climate-related financial disclosures and to incorporate climate-related risks into their supervisory frameworks.</p>
<p>Digital innovation in payments has the potential to boost the provision of &ndash; and access to &ndash; finance in the region. Such innovation could help meet the goals of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/">G20&rsquo;s Roadmap</a>&nbsp;for cheaper, faster, more accessible and transparent cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. Members notably discussed issues and developments related to open finance, fast payment systems, central bank digital currencies and crypto-assets, and challenges in fostering digital innovation in payments. Members noted the importance of the FSB&rsquo;s work to promote greater alignment and interoperability in these frameworks within and across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Recent operational incidents, such as the CrowdStrike failure, illustrate the risks from financial institutions&rsquo; reliance on third-party providers. Members discussed their progress in implementing the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">toolkit</a>&nbsp;to help financial institutions to monitor, identify and manage risks arising from third-party services and work to strengthen their cyber resilience. Members acknowledged the FSB&rsquo;s efforts in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/recommendations-to-achieve-greater-convergence-in-cyber-incident-reporting-final-report/">promoting greater convergence in cyber incident reporting</a>&nbsp;and looked forward to participating in the upcoming consultation on a format for incident reporting exchange.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Americas is co-chaired by Kenneth Baker, Managing Director and CEO, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. Membership includes financial authorities from Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States of America and Uruguay. The International Monetary Fund also attended this meeting.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/fsb-americas-group-discusses-macroprudential-frameworks-climate-risks-digital-payments-and-operational-resilience/#aa5dbae1-d2c7-46f1-acd4-2dcfe06a7b98" id="aa5dbae1-d2c7-46f1-acd4-2dcfe06a7b98-link">1</a></span>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>The Derivatives Service Bureau Calls For Participation In Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) - DSB TAC To Commence Its Fourth Charter Term</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-derivatives-service-bureau-calls-for-participation-in-technology-advisory-co-1/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-derivatives-service-bureau-calls-for-participation-in-technology-advisory-co-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DSB, Technology Advisory Committee, OTC derivatives, application deadline, governance<br />
Summary:<br />
DSB's TAC welcomes new applicants for a two-year term. It provides technical stewardship, advises on industry consultation topics, and shapes DSB's technology roadmap. <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today announced that the DSB&rsquo;s Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter is&nbsp;</span><span>welcoming new applicants&nbsp;</span><span>ahead of a new two (2) year term</span><span>, with an application deadline of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>23rd October.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Established in 2018, the TAC provides advisory support to the DSB in recognition of required enhancements and adaptations to its technology base and services. Working alongside the DSB Product and Governance Advisory Committees, the TAC is responsible for the technical stewardship ensuring the DSB technology strategy is aligned with the needs of the markets it serves, including making recommendations to the DSB Board&nbsp;</span>on technology-related DSB industry consultation topics.<br /><br />The TAC is composed of representatives from DSB user organisations, independent experts and regulatory observers within the wider OTC derivatives community and its remit includes matters relating to both the OTC International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) Services.&nbsp;The DSB invites applications from OTC-derivatives technology practitioners from across all jurisdictions and institutional types to contribute to DSB technical governance and development.</span></p>
<p><span>During previous charter terms, the TAC has focused on the DSB&rsquo;s resiliency, including the DSB&rsquo;s disaster recovery arrangements. A key development is the addition of a second &ldquo;as-production&rdquo; UAT environment, introduced to assist users with regression testing of their own IT changes against the DSB. The TAC has also launched specialist subcommittees with the Global Agile Architecture subcommittee having recently overseen the migration of&nbsp;<span>the DSB&rsquo;s infrastructure to&nbsp;</span><span>a globally distributed data repository covering multiple locations in Europe and North America.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Andy Hughes, a member of the DSB Management Team and DDO of the TAC,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;The collaboration with the TAC over the last charter term&nbsp;</span><span>which helped shape UPI implementation and its integration into the OTC ISIN Service</span><span>. This continued collaboration with the TAC members will be essential during this next charter term as the DSB expands into further global jurisdictional regions and adapts to changes in digital operations."<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB&nbsp;</strong>added<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The TAC is instrumental in shaping the DSB technology roadmap. The technical expertise of the TAC continues to play a key part in the evolution of our services. The work of the DSB industry representation groups is highly valued and designed to ensure that all developments continue to best serve industry requirements.&rdquo;</span></p>

Derivatives traded volume achieved single-day records over two consecutive days during the month, reaching as high as 3.46 million contracts across equities, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities on 25 September.</p>
<p>Key highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

AUM of real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs surpassed S$1 billion for the first time on the back of strong third-quarter inflows alongside a rally in the Singapore REIT sector.

<div class="container">
<h2>Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities unique to market-based finance explain why we delivered the most significant reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets in a generation.</li>
<li>Our review of the financial advice and guidance boundary aims to unlock innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs.</li>
<li>We will continue to collaborate as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether in London, in Brussels, Hong Kong or New York, the same discussion is underway: how do we maximise the ability of sustainable, vibrant capital markets to drive greater volumes of investment into the real economy?</p>
<p>That question &ndash; asked by policymakers and industry alike &ndash; is why we brought you all here today and I want to thank all the speakers who have made this conference such a success.</p>
<p>I know that many of you, like me, have had whole careers dedicated to capital markets during an era where globalisation drove a remarkable surge of cross-border investment flows. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>UK equity markets reforms</h2>
<p>I started my career as one of a vast number of very junior lawyers who worked on the UK&rsquo;s gas, water, electricity and telecoms privatisations of the '80s, amid the huge changes brought about by the financial services 'big bang'.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in the astounding development of China&rsquo;s international equity and bond markets. And not long ago I led the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global regulatory standard setter for securities markets.</p>
<p>I have seen first-hand how capital markets can work well. How they can drive business &ndash; with factories built, shops opened, goods delivered, people employed; how they can support long-term risk taking to deliver more secure retirements for millions of people; and how they can spur wider economic growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen how market fragmentation and de-globalisation can stall cross-border capital formation.</p>
<p>But it's the opportunities that are unique to market-based finance which explain why the FCA has just delivered the most significant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-overhauls-listing-rules-boost-growth-and-innovation-uk-stock-markets" title="FCA overhauls listing rules to boost growth and innovation on UK stock markets">reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets</a>&nbsp;in a generation.</p>
<p>These reforms are already having an impact, ensuring that more businesses can get into the shop window. But the harder task is to more effectively mobilise the domestic savings necessary to grow these businesses.</p>
<p>When we talk about listings regimes, stamp duty, accounting rules, or even initial public offerings (IPO&rsquo;s), those outside this room could be forgiven for thinking we&rsquo;re speaking in a foreign language, switching off as a result, unsure how any of it matters to them.</p>
<p>So, we need to make a case for it to matter to a far wider section of the population. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wider inclusion</h2>
<p>In the US, stock market performance routinely features in political debate and retail participation is the norm. Total equity market capitalisation is around 55 trillion dollars, or 200% of GDP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, three quarters of corporate financing in the EU is bank lending and, as we have heard, efforts to promote a capital markets union recognise the implications of this for the real economy.</p>
<p>UK market capitalisation stands at around 3.2 trillion dollars, or 100% of GDP. But since the heady days of the 1980s, structural and other factors have fostered a low-to-no risk culture, which if left unaddressed, has clear implications for our ability to finance future economic growth.</p>
<p>Back in Hong Kong, I saw a very different investment culture. One in which retail participation was far greater than here in the UK, and where people were much more aware of how the market works and the risks involved.</p>
<p>In the UK,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.newfinancial.org/reports/widening-retail-participation-in-equity-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the proportion of households<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;directly owning stocks and shares has halved in 2 decades. According to New Financial, just 4.4% of UK pension funds assets are held in domestic equities. That has a huge opportunity cost for capital hungry businesses, and for the wider economy.</p>
<p>It creates a gap for individuals, too.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/09/the-uk-investment-gap--p430-billion-in-cash-savings-not-invested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barclays reports<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;that 13 million UK adults are missing out by holding &pound;430 billion in cash savings which could be put to more productive use. So, we are looking to address this.</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review</h2>
<p>Our Review with the Government of the boundary between regulated financial advice and guidance is incredibly technical. Unpicking the interplay between our own rules, domestic legislation and consolidated EU law is hard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But its aim is simple: unlocking innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs, in easy-to-access ways, at prices they can afford, so they have the confidence to make the most of their money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in doing this, we boost growth: for personal finances, for those seeking investment, and for the UK as a whole.</p>
<h2>Value for Money Framework</h2>
<p>This goal also underpins our Framework, developed jointly with Government and The Pensions Regulator, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/pensions-value-money" title="Pensions value for money">value for money</a>&nbsp;for workplace pension savers.</p>
<p>This seeks to ensure the &pound;130 billion a year saved into these schemes works harder for people. A focus on value rather than costs should help providers invest in assets that deliver greater long-term returns.</p>
<p>Through these and a raft of other initiatives, we are looking to shift our national view of risk.</p>
<p>Today has shown that many others around the world are grappling with similar issues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to continued collaboration with colleagues, both domestic and global, as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Derivatives have an important role to play in the development of economies and financial markets in emerging jurisdictions. Financial regulation, in turn, is a critical element in shaping the safe, efficient use and growth of risk management activity in these countries. One of the most important elements of the financial regulatory framework for derivatives is margining: the exchange of collateral, or margin, for derivatives transactions. This paper explains what margining is, how it works and the key issues for policymakers in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) to consider when transposing margin-related regulation to their jurisdictions, with a particular focus on non-cleared derivatives.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CanDeal DNA, the premier source for Canadian OTC fixed income and derivatives pricing, is partnering with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to distribute CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates are expected to become key reference rates for the market due to quality and consistency of coverage with inputs provided by, and consensus derived from, CanDeal&rsquo;s partner banks and dealers.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA works closely with industry stakeholders to provide data and solutions to support the Canadian market and global market participants. This product innovation is an extension of CanDeal&rsquo;s collaborative efforts with the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) as the market transitions away from CDOR to the new Term CORRA benchmark. CanDeal DNA publishes statistics and analysis resulting from the transition to Term CORRA in our CanDeal Observations bulletin available at <a href="http://candeal.com/" title="candeal.com">candeal.com</a>.</p>
<p>The CanDeal Consensus CAD OIS (CORRA) Rates product is designed to provide market transparency in the OIS swap curve for out to two years, while the CanDeal Consensus CAD Swap (CORRA) Rates product provides rates from two to 30 years. Each rate represents the market rate for the fixed leg of a swap where the floating leg references the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA).</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates will be available via LSEG Data &amp; Analytics under a global free-trial period until January 1, 2025. Thereafter, the products will become fee liable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal is the premier service for Canadian fixed income and interest rate derivatives data. This extension of our partnership will enable our clients to derive additional value through access to the Consensus OIS and Swap Rates,&rdquo; said Debbie Lawrence, Group Head of Data Strategy and Management at LSEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cessation of the CDOR benchmark has been a turning point for the financial industry,&rdquo; said Andre Craig, President of CanDeal DNA, a division of CanDeal Group, a leading provider of an electronic marketplace and data services for Canadian dollar debt securities and derivatives. &ldquo;In addition to collaborating with CanDeal Benchmark Solutions and market stakeholders to launch the forward-looking Term CORRA benchmark this past year, we are honored to continue to partner with the industry and with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to introduce the Consensus OIS and Swap Curves and provide deeper transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside their award-winning Reference Pricing Service, CanDeal DNA provides intraday and real-time pricing for Canadian fixed income securities, advanced and regulatory analytics, security master, and curves solutions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of a multi-asset class climate transition risk solution, which provides emissions estimates and portfolio analytics across various fixed income asset classes, covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and real estate. This new solution, combined with ICE&rsquo;s existing coverage of sovereign, corporate equity, and private companies, can enable clients to assess and benchmark their financed emissions across a comprehensive range of fixed income asset classes in one integrated offering.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s new multi-asset class transition risk solution addresses gaps in emissions data by covering underserved sub-asset classes, such as RMBS, CMBS, and private corporates. By integrating this data, ICE can provide a unified portfolio metric that tracks financed emissions across multiple asset classes, supporting climate risk reporting, ensuring a holistic portfolio coverage from a physical and transition risk standpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our clients increasingly need quality transition risk data for underserved segments, particularly mortgage-backed securities, where we have applied physics-based simulations with building energy models and ICE&rsquo;s data to provide emissions insights for RMBS and CMBS,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Head of ICE Climate. &ldquo;Mortgages and mortgage securities can represent more than 20 percent of bank balance sheets, leading to a growing need for data to help meet regulatory disclosure and support stress testing to inform decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s multi-asset class transition risk solution provides PCAF-aligned (<a href="https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/about" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials</a>) financed emissions data, encompassing over 110 million US properties and more than 4.2 million fixed income securities globally. With this solution, clients can leverage advanced portfolio analytics to evaluate total emissions across multi-asset class portfolios, assisting clients in transition risk strategies. ICE&rsquo;s methodologies, customized for each asset class, provide comprehensive emissions tracking, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 estimates, as well as carbon intensity metrics, essential to meet climate regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>This new solution is part of the company&rsquo;s climate data offering, which provides data and analytics that help quantify investment impacts posed by transition risks as well as physical climate risks, such as extreme weather events.</p>
