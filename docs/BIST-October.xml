<div> meeting, Financial Stability Oversight Council, update, executive session, transparency
Summary:
The Treasury Department will host a closed executive session of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to discuss financial developments and regulatory issues. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>On Friday, October, 18, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen will preside over a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) at the Treasury Department. The meeting will consist only of an executive session. The preliminary agenda for the executive session includes an update on banking and commercial real estate developments; an update on short-term investment vehicles; an update on Federal Housing Finance Agency proposals related to the Federal Home Loan Banks; an update on private credit; and an update on the Council&rsquo;s 2024 annual report.</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Council to convene no less than quarterly, but the Council has historically convened on a more frequent basis. The meetings bring Council members together to discuss and analyze emerging market developments and financial regulatory issues. The Council is committed to conducting its business as openly and transparently as practicable, given the confidential supervisory and sensitive information at the center of its work. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/webcasts">Open session Council meetings are made available to the public via live webcast and can also be viewed after they occur</a>. Upcoming Council meeting dates and times are posted following the official notification to Council members of an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes and readouts for past Council meetings are available below. Meeting minutes for the most recent Council meeting are generally approved at the next Council meeting and posted online soon afterwards.</p>
<p><small>* In accordance with the Council&rsquo;s Transparency Policy, which is available at&nbsp;</small><a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><small>www.fsoc.gov</small></a><small>, this meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law; and to conduct administrative business of the Council.&nbsp;</small></p>

Summary:<br /> Solactive partners with Themes ETFs to launch the Solactive Transatlantic Aerospace & Defense Index for the Themes Transatlantic Defense ETF (Ticker: NATO). Provides targeted exposure to defense companies in NATO member states. <div>
<p><strong>Solactive is excited to partner again with Themes ETFs in launching the Solactive Transatlantic Aerospace &amp; Defense Index, which serves as the underlying index for the Themes Transatlantic Defense ETF. Responding to evolving international dynamics, this ETF focuses on investment opportunities arising from increased defense spending among NATO nations. Furthermore, it addresses the growing demand for cutting-edge technology and defense systems in these markets. With NATO&rsquo;s collective security commitments and defense partnerships, the sector benefits from a foundation of long-term stability.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0J4B4">Solactive Transatlantic Aerospace &amp; Defense Index</a>&nbsp;represents a rules-based selection of equities headquartered in NATO member countries and classified within relevant aerospace and defense industry segments. Focusing on this core geographic alliance, the index aims to provide targeted exposure to the evolving dynamics supporting long-term demand within these industries.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Index constituents are selected from the Solactive GBS Global Markets All Cap USD Index, based on minimum liquidity criteria.

<div> Consultation, Pillar 3 data hub, IT solutions, EBA, prudential disclosures
Summary:<br /><br />The EBA is consulting on IT solutions for centralizing prudential disclosures through a Pillar 3 data hub on its website to comply with the new Banking Package. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>The consultation paper defines the IT solutions and processes that large and other institutions shall follow to publish Pillar 3 information centrally in the EBA data hub.</em></li>
<li><em>The proposed IT solutions leverage the EBA&rsquo;s past and ongoing work and infrastructures&nbsp; in the area of disclosures and reporting.</em></li>
<li><em>The Pillar 3 data hub will centralise on the EBA website the Pillar 3 disclosures of all EU institutions, thus allowing users to download data and visualize the Pillar 3 information in a standardised format.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on the Pillar 3 data hub, which will centralise prudential disclosures by institutions through a single electronic access point on the EBA website. This project is part of the Banking Package laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6). This consultation runs until 11 November.</span></p>
<p>The draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) present the IT solutions and processes to be followed by large and other institutions when submitting their respective Pillar 3 disclosures. This includes the IT solutions to be used, the data exchange formats to be considered, the technical validations to be performed by the EBA.</p>
<p>The EBA welcomes feedback both from institutions and users of Pillar 3 information.</p>
<p>The current proposals in the consultation paper consider the feedback received from the industry on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">discussion paper</a>&nbsp;published in December 2023. The summary of this feedback and respective EBA analysis is included in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>In parallel, the EBA continues to run a pilot exercise with voluntary institutions to test the process for large and other institutions. Conclusions from the pilot exercise, together with the feedback received during this consultation, will be taken into account when finalising the draft ITS to be submitted to the European Commission for adoption.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation paper can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 11&nbsp;November 2024. All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<p>A public hearing will be organised in the form of a webinar on 21 October from 15:00 to 16:30 CET.&nbsp;Please register for the hearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-its-p3dh">here</a>&nbsp;by 17 October 13:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, backgrounds d next steps</h4>
<p>The new Banking Package (CRR3/CRD6), which will implement the latest Basel III reforms in the EU, includes a mandate to the EBA to develop a Pillar 3 data hub. The EBA&rsquo;s plan on how to implement the mandates included in the banking package is explained in the &lsquo;EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework&rsquo;, published in December 2023.</p>
<p>The CRR3 (Articles 434 and 434a) mandates the EBA to publish on its website all the prudential disclosures for all institutions subject to these disclosure requirements, making it readily available in a centralised manner to all the relevant stakeholders through a single electronic access point on its website. To comply with this mandate the EBA is building a data hub putting together all the disclosures required under Part Eight of the CRR.</p>
<p>The CRD6 (Article 106) mandates the EBA to issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010,&nbsp;to specify the requirements set out in paragraph 1 under which Competent Authorities are empowered to require disclosures more frequently than required under CRR3, set deadlines to institutions to submit the information to EBA and require institutions to use specific media and locations for publication, other than the EBA website for centralised disclosures.</p>
<p>The draft ITS for small and non-complex institutions and on the resubmission policy will be consulted separately, at a later stage.</p>

<div> Community Banks, Regulatory Challenges, Competition, Cybersecurity, Third-Party Risk Management
Summary:
Community banks face challenges in third-party risk management, competition, and cybersecurity. Regulatory reform is needed for tailoring and supervision.
<br /><br />Summary: Thank you for the opportunity to speak at the 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium. I highlighted the challenges facing community banks, such as competition, cybersecurity, and third-party risk management. Regulatory reforms are needed to ensure tailoring and supervision. <div>
<p>Good afternoon, I'd like to begin by thanking the event organizers, including our staff at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors for inviting me to share my thoughts with you at the 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1">1</a>&nbsp;I always enjoy the opportunity to speak to bankers across the country and share perspectives on the issues facing the banking and financial system, especially when it's related to community banks.</p>
<p>Banks are a critical component of the U.S. economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2">2</a>&nbsp;Their work often extends well beyond the provision of credit&mdash; providing services and volunteer and financial support within their community. Among many things, banks offer financial education, sponsorships and funding for community programs and events. Without question, community banks are important and integral to the local economy.</p>
<p>But community banks also face challenges that require proactive risk management, effective and efficient prioritization of compliance resources, and the need to innovate. Today, I would like to briefly highlight some of the issues banks are facing and discuss ways that community banks and regulators can more effectively work together in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges Facing Community Banks</strong><br />As this audience knows well, community banks face a number of challenges. They often rely on third-party service providers to offer products and services to their customers. It may be more difficult for them to hire and retain qualified staff or plan for future leadership with management succession planning. Given limited staffing, they may be overwhelmed by the recent onslaught of new regulations and guidance. And in light of all of this, it may be challenging to prioritize resources in order to appropriately focus on the most important risks facing their businesses. While the headwinds may seem overwhelming, community banks are always resilient in the face of change.</p>
<p>Often, one of the greatest challenges facing a community bank is not about managing any particular risk but rather how to address all of the risks they face&mdash;and how to&nbsp;<em>prioritize&nbsp;</em>the approach to address each of those risks. Regulators have, at times, exacerbated these challenges through policy choices. The risk of mis-prioritization is not limited to community banks. In my mind, this was most recently evident in the events and supervision leading to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Management failed to address growing interest rate risk and funding risks, and supervisors failed to prioritize and escalate these issues. Our goal should be to identify, understand, and learn from these past mistakes, and to avoid repeating them.</p>
<p>Both regulators and banks should be working toward a common goal&mdash;a banking system that supports economic activity throughout the country, in which banks operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer laws and regulations. In considering the challenges facing community banks, both regulators and banks have an important role to play.</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong><br />Community banks face competitive pressures from many sources. These pressures may result from local or regional economic conditions, the needs of retail and business customers, and the products and services available in the market. Competitors can take the form of traditional banks, internet banks, and non-banks like fin-techs and mortgage companies. While fin-tech partnerships can be beneficial to both the customer and the bank, if the relationship is not managed according to safe and sound banking principles, serious problems can result. When deposits are accepted through fin-tech relationships but not handled appropriately, deposit insurance can be jeopardized and the ability to access deposited funds may be impacted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3">3</a></p>
<p>Competition can also come from other local competitors like credit unions, large banks with a broader operational footprint, payday lenders, or other nonbank credit sources. As bank customers grow increasingly comfortable and familiar with new mechanisms for doing business, the use of online banking has continued to expand. This has tended to increase the footprint of non-local banks or lenders, enabling them to effectively compete for business outside of their geographic area. Even against this backdrop, research shows that community banks have maintained an important role in many banking markets, including in small- and medium-sized business lending.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4">4</a></p>
<p>The regulatory framework establishes expectations for how community banks can compete, and often creates an unlevel playing field with many of these competitors. This includes whether they are subject to the same regulation as banks that engage in the same activities and how competition is evaluated.</p>
<p>A core concept in financial regulation is to impose the same regulation&mdash;and I suggest we expand this to include the same regulation, guidance, and supervisory expectations&mdash;on entities that are engaged in the same activities. Banks compete against many non-bank providers, including financial technology firms, credit unions, and other non-bank lenders. In some of these head-to-head competitions, community banks face distinct disadvantages that can pose challenges when competing for the same banking opportunities. For example, banks are subject to taxes and additional regulatory requirements (including the Community Reinvestment Act). They are also subject to a broader range of restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements or the "soft" power of supervision. In all of these cases, the disparity in the legal framework can have a distortive effect on competition. In short, where the financial regulatory framework can provide for parity of treatment, it should do so. The regulatory framework should not knowingly distort competition, or effectively impose a regulatory allocation of credit.</p>
<p>The framework also plays an important role in assessing competition among banks. The mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) approval process can have a disproportionate impact on community banks because the "screens" that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger often result in a finding that M&amp;A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5">5</a>&nbsp;Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects&mdash;which is grounded in the effect of proposed transactions on the control of deposits within individual banking markets&mdash;often requires additional review or analysis, and can lead to delays in the regulatory approval process.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br />Community banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are costly and time-consuming experiences, and they pose unique challenges for community banks. For example, the maintenance of and the technology resources required to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident "resilience" and response capabilities by identifying resources and opportunities for banks to develop "muscle memory" in cyber incident response.</p>
<p>Recent incidents, like the Crowdstrike-related outage, have highlighted the heavy dependence many banks have on technology, third-party providers, and the broader supply chain. In the current risk environment, it is important for banks of all sizes to implement sound operational resilience, cybersecurity, and third-party risk-management practices. One important resource for community banks is the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk management practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop, with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6">6</a>&nbsp;Over the past two years, this workshop has provided a forum to further cyber risk discussions among community bankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Today's Symposium also includes an interactive cyber workshop, during which participants will participate in a cyber exercise, working through the various decisions that would be required in responding to a hypothetical cyberattack.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7">7</a></p>
<p>We know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system. We also recognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to cyber threats. Therefore, regulators should ensure that a range of resources are available to support community banks and seek further opportunities to help build community bank resilience against these threats.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Risk Management</strong><br />Third-party risk management can pose an additional challenge for community banks. Due to their size and scale, community banks often leverage centralized resources&mdash;technical experts who have greater expertise than the bank could fully maintain on staff&mdash;to advise and assist on a range of issues. Often these third-party service providers are significantly larger, and their bank clients&mdash;including smaller banks&mdash;may lack leverage in conducting due diligence and negotiating the terms of the relationship.</p>
<p>In 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-party risk management, which was expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the time it was issued, the guidance included shortcomings that were known and identified but not addressed in advance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8">8</a></p>
<p>What many of you may not know is that after nearly a year from the original publication, the regulators published a guide to assist community banks&nbsp;<em>interpret&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>apply&nbsp;</em>the guidance to their third-party risk management activities. The guide was intended to provide additional context for the guidance&mdash;including step-by-step examples of how to address third-party risk management&mdash;making the guidance more useful. While I am pleased that the community bank implementation guide was eventually published, the delays in its publication suggest a shortcoming in our regulatory approach. We must ensure new guidance provides clarity to regulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the time the guidance is published.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Compliance</strong><br />Like third-party risk management, consumer compliance can be another area that may present challenges to community banks given their size and scale. An effective and well-run consumer compliance program balances consumer protection with the complexity and cost to establish a robust compliance management program. One challenge for community banks is the difficulty in retaining qualified consumer compliance experts. Notwithstanding these challenges, community banks devote significant time and resources to their consumer compliance risk management programs. Compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, is essential to ensuring that the banking system provides fair and broad access to credit and financial services.</p>
<p>Community banks take these responsibilities seriously, and the overwhelming majority of banks that we supervise invest in strong compliance management systems to prevent violations and detect problems before they occur. When consumer compliance concerns arise, banks address them by making their customers whole and adopting the necessary changes to ensure that issues do not persist or reoccur. In a very small subset of cases, banks fall short of their obligations, and we hold those institutions accountable through enforcement actions or other supervisory actions.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision program is risk-focused and tailored to a bank's compliance risk, focused on the activities that present the greatest risk. One example related to third-party risk management is our recent system supervisory focus on consumer compliance risks associated with fin-tech relationships. As a result of this work, our supervisors seek to identify the parties to relationships that pose the greatest risk of consumer harm. This effort promotes our understanding of higher risk fin-tech partners across the Federal Reserve System, and helps supervisors proactively identify relationships that pose greater risk of consumer harm.</p>
<p><strong>Other Core Risks</strong><br />There are a number of "core" risks that are essential for bank management to address. These "core" risks&mdash;including funding, liquidity and credit risk&mdash;should already be integrated into management priorities, since they pose the greatest threats to a bank's operations.</p>
<p>Focusing on core risks is second nature for community banks. In contrast, supervision can be susceptible to diversion from core to non-core risks leading supervisors to neglect the build-up of traditional risk. Diverting resources to non-core risks can often leave a bank vulnerable, especially when regulators direct banks to allocate resources in other ways, whether by regulation, guidance, or through supervisory expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigating Risks to Community Banks</strong><br />The design of regulation, guidance, and supervisory approach regulators rely upon for community banks&mdash;and the intentional policy choices that underpin this framework&mdash;are important for ensuring their effectiveness in supporting the safety and soundness of the banking system. These design choices can enable community banks to operate successfully while mitigating risks, leveraging tailoring, transparency, and consistency across institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9">9</a>&nbsp;I have spoken at length about these themes in the past, but I would like to reiterate just a few of the critical elements of a regulatory agenda that will allow community banks to thrive in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to revisit size thresholds over time as inflation and economic growth slowly erode our regulatory categories. The bank regulatory framework is built largely upon asset-based size thresholds, and these thresholds should reflect a deliberate policy choice. But, over time, these fixed thresholds effectively result in more firms being "scoped in" to higher compliance tiers over time, even when there has been no change in a bank's underlying risk profile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10">10</a></li>
<li>We need to have a regulatory system in which M&amp;A transactions and de novo bank formations are possible for banks, not one in which regulatory approval requirements are used to impose additional (and extra-regulatory) requirements on firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11">11</a>&nbsp;Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes are necessary to avoid creating a "barbell" of the very largest and very smallest banks in the banking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time. Left unchecked, an applications process that imposes additional costs and delays on healthy and appropriate banking transactions will result in a reduction in available credit and services, an increase in the number of unbanked or underbanked communities, and economic harm.</li>
<li>We should prioritize direct experience in our regulatory efforts, giving greater voice and opportunities for input from policymakers with banking or state supervisory experience currently at the Federal banking agencies, and by soliciting and accepting feedback from our state banking counterparts. Greater coordination and participation by a wider set of policymakers in regulatory reform efforts would bring several benefits. For example, discussion of competing ideas and compromise in the drafting of regulatory proposals often results in a more moderate approach, reducing dramatic swings of the regulatory pendulum. And in many instances, we can better anticipate the unintended consequences of reform proposals if policymakers engage in good faith discussions and coordination of these efforts.</li>
<li>While regulatory reform brings many benefits, we should also shift our mindset to focus on the tradeoffs of regulation, guidance, and supervision. Changes to the regulatory framework often yield benefits in terms of greater visibility into the workings of the banking system, additional capital that can absorb losses and promote financial resiliency, and more conservative risk-management standards for interest rate risk and funding risk. But we need to evaluate not only the benefits of proposals but also the costs and unintended consequences. How will banks adjust their activities in response? Will they raise prices on lending activities or for other banking products or services? Will they exit certain low-margin businesses, resulting in greater concentration and increased financial stability risk? By considering the cumulative burden, we can better address and acknowledge these concerns.</li>
<li>And finally, we must incorporate "tailoring"&mdash;calibrating the regulatory framework based on the size and complexity of banks' activities&mdash;as a required input for regulatory consideration. Tailoring helps us to better allocate finite resources both in banks and among regulators and helps us avoid threatening the long-term viability of community banks by simply adding to the mass of existing regulations, guidance, and other supervisory material. We simply cannot ignore the "cumulative" or "compounding" effect of increasing the complexity of the regulatory framework and we must make room in our reform agenda for the unglamorous work of "maintenance" in promoting an efficient framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>By no means is this proposal for regulatory reform exhaustive, but these critical components must be integrated into our future approach to ensure a diverse banking system for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and for your commitment to community banking. You serve a critical role within the banking system, and in support of the U.S. economy. Your work to leverage the power of the community banking model enables you to serve your customers, promote financial inclusion and expand access to banking services. But policymakers have an important responsibility to make sure that the community banking model remains viable into the future. To function effectively, the banking system requires the presence of banks of all sizes&mdash;larger, regional, and community banks. This diversity of our financial institutions is the greatest strength of our banking system, and it can easily be imperiled by insufficiently targeted regulation, supervision, and guidance.</p>

Summary:<br />
BSX supports World Investor Week, promoting financial literacy. Bell ringing ceremony with Bermuda College and CFA Society Bermuda. Workshops from Oct 30-Nov 13. <div>
<p>The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), a wholly owned subsidiary of Miami International Holdings, Inc., hosted a ceremonial &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy&rdquo; event as part of the World Federation of Exchanges&rsquo; (WFE) support for World Investor Week. This initiative is led by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and aims to raise awareness about the importance of investor education and protection on a global scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BSX is pleased to once again participate in IOSCO&rsquo;s World Investor Week and the WFE&rsquo;s Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy global initiative,&rdquo; said Greg Wojciechowski, BSX President and CEO. &ldquo;Promoting financial literacy while supporting our local community by encouraging investment in domestic and international markets is an important initiative for BSX. We were delighted to host the CFA Society Bermuda and Bermuda College at the bell ringing ceremony and help raise visibility for their financial literacy programs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As one of 63 stock exchanges worldwide participating in the bell ringing ceremony, BSX teamed up with Bermuda College and the CFA Society Bermuda to promote the Society&rsquo;s Building Financial Literacy workshop series as part of the College&rsquo;s Athora Division of Professional and Career Education (APACE) programme. The three-week programme aims to drive financial literacy across Bermuda by teaching fundamental money and financial concepts including the basics of budgeting and savings, income and expenses, and planning for retirement. The workshops begin on 30 October.</p>
<p>"Money influences our lives directly and indirectly every day and building financial literacy helps to improve confidence and reduce anxiety when facing financial decisions,&rdquo; noted Romari Tucker, Education Chair of the CFA Society. &ldquo;The CFA Society Bermuda has promoted financial literacy within the community through this course since 2019, with the goal being to empower individuals to make informed financial decisions. We are pleased to continue offering this program in partnership with the Bermuda College."</p>
<p>Tawana Flood, Director of the Athora Division of Professional and Career Education stated, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s bell ringing is a signature moment for Bermuda College. Money is often referred to as the global language of success and it is important that everyone learns how to speak that language, regardless of one&rsquo;s economic status or standing. A strong foundation in financial literacy is key and Bermuda College&rsquo;s Financial Literacy Series, in partnership with the CFA Society Bermuda, is proud to provide access to that financial literacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s workshops run from 30 October to 13 November.&nbsp; For more information or if you are interested in registering for this year&rsquo;s series, please visit <a href="http://www.college.bm/">www.college.bm</a><a href="http://www.college.bm/">.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<div> publishing, Basel Committee, liquidity risk, empirical analysis, supervision<br />
Summary:<br />
Basel Committee updates G20 on banking turmoil analysis, focusing on liquidity risk dynamics and plans to strengthen supervisory effectiveness. <div>
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee provides update to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on its analytical work of the 2023 banking turmoil.</li>
<li>Report summarises empirical analysis on liquidity risk dynamics observed during the turmoil.</li>
<li>Committee will continue work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness and assess whether specific features of the Basel Framework performed as intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is today publishing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d582.htm"><span class="firstword">progress</span>&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on its analytical work of the 2023 banking turmoil. The report, requested by the G20 Brazilian Presidency, provides an update on the Committee's analytical work on liquidity risk dynamics observed during the turmoil. It builds on the Committee's stocktake report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d555.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">published</span></a>&nbsp;in October 2023.</p>
<p>The progress report includes updated empirical analysis on the liquidity outflow rates experienced by distressed banks during the turmoil and assesses the materiality of liquidity risk factors that are not explicitly covered by the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The report also analyses the impact of the accounting treatment and valuation of liquid assets eligible to meet the LCR and other potential impediments to banks' ability and willingness to draw down their liquidity buffer. It also assesses the use and role of supervisory monitoring tools and other stress indicators.</p>
<p>Drawing on the findings of this progress report, the Committee is continuing to pursue a series of follow-up initiatives related to the turmoil, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>prioritising work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness and identify issues that could merit additional guidance at a global level; and</li>
<li>pursuing additional follow-up analytical work based on empirical evidence to assess whether specific features of the Basel Framework, such as liquidity risk and interest rate risk in the banking book, performed as intended during the turmoil and assess the need to explore policy options over the medium term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This follow-up work is fully in line with the imperative of implementing the Basel III standards in a full and consistent manner, and as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>Background</em></h4>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>SEC Charges U.S.-Based Moog Inc. With FCPA Violations For Subsidiary’s Role In Indian Bribery Scheme</title>

<div> SEC, Moog Inc., FCPA, India, bribery
Summary:
Moog Inc. agreed to pay a $1.1 million civil penalty for violating the FCPA by bribing Indian officials through its subsidiary. The SEC found Moog violated recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions. Moog consented to cease future violations and pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. <br /><br />Summary: The SEC found Moog Inc. violated the FCPA by bribing Indian officials through its subsidiary Moog Motion Controls and agreed to pay a $1.1 million civil penalty. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Moog Inc., a New York-based global manufacturer of motion controls systems for aerospace, defense, industrial and medical markets, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.1 million to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of bribes paid by its wholly owned Indian subsidiary, Moog Motion Controls Private Limited (Moog Motion Controls).</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, from 2020 through 2022, Moog Motion Controls employees bribed a variety of Indian officials to win business and also used a variety of schemes to make the improper payments, including by funneling them through third-party agents and distributors. These same Moog Motion Controls employees also offered cash bribes to Indian officials in an attempt to cause public tenders in India to favor Moog&rsquo;s products and exclude competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s action against Moog highlights the need for issuers operating internationally to have appropriate compliance and internal accounting controls over third parties and third-party payments, as weaknesses in those systems heighten corruption risk,&rdquo; said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Moog violated the recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Moog consented to the entry of the SEC&rsquo;s order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations and agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling nearly $600,000, and a civil penalty of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Irene Gutierrez, Michelle L. Ramos, Maria F. Boodoo, and Tracy L. Price of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>

<div> September 2024, CUSIP issuance report, decrease, new identifiers, corporate, municipal<br />
Summary:<br />
September 2024 CUSIP issuance report shows a decrease in new corporate and municipal identifier requests. Overall, there is a positive trend in volume. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y_d034Z-mnePzVSEe1vuUCeXMwe9KN41yjurc9yA0B4uNple1N5Qx78emULMkwYdJKtQi4NTKYWkOnt8q05C8a9EQuZ_FQQPjzBDzVgY83QtHuDoWv6LdLHQrcxAo94R" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a><span>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for September 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a decrease in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</span></p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,160 in September, which is down 5.8% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 4.3%. The monthly decline in volume was driven by a 7.7% decrease in request volume for U.S. corporate equity identifiers and a 10.0% decrease in request volume for Canadian corporate identifiers. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-5.4%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-19.1%) also fell in September.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 10.2% versus August totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 7.2%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 167 new CUSIP requests in September, followed by New York (134) and California (69).</p>
<p>&ldquo;While CUSIP request volume is down across most asset classes, this month, that is largely a reflection of difficult comparisons to last month, where we saw a significant surge in new issuance activity,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;On an annualized basis, we&rsquo;re seeing a positive trend in CUSIP request volume as we turn the corner to the fourth quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 9.5% in September and international debt CUSIP requests rose 13.2%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 2.4% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 100.3%.</p>

<div> Scams, Retirement planning, Investor protection, InvestSmart® Fest, Financial education
Summary:
InvestSmart® Fest 2024 focuses on retirement planning and protecting investors from scams, with rising scam complaints and an Anti-Scam Zone featured. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today kicked off its annual investor education event InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> Fest 2024, focusing on retirement planning and safeguarding investors from scams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent SC study<sup>1</sup> found that 54% of respondents believe their savings are insufficient for retirement with only 16% confident their funds will last over 20 years after retirement. Alarmingly, 18% of respondents feel their saving can only be sustained for five years or less.</p>
<p>Investor protection also remains a pressing issue, with 3,380 scam related complaints and enquiries received by the SC as of the third quarter of this year. This trend has been on the rise, with a 28%<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; increase last year, proving the evolving sophistication of fraudulent schemes despite regulatory interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As such, InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> Fest 2024 highlights SC&rsquo;s efforts in increasing awareness and knowledge on the benefits of safe investing as well as saving earlier in life.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi stressed that staying vigilant in an increasingly digital world is no longer a priority for investors, but a necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SC remains committed to safeguarding investors, but vigilance is key. Through InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest, we are equipping Malaysians with the tools to recognise threats and make secure financial decisions,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SC Executive Director and General Counsel Yew Yee Tee warned of rising digital scams involving deepfakes, fraudulent pre-IPO schemes and the mislabeling of Shariah compliant products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public must practice caution and ensure they deal with licensed individuals or companies before making any investment decisions," she said in her opening speech at the event.</p>
<p>In response to the growing influence of financial influencers (finfluencers) on social media, the SC has updated the Guidance Note on the Provision of Investment Advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC also cautioned against mule account scams, where victims are persuaded to rent out their bank accounts, leading to serious consequences.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Bursa Malaysia, InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest 2024 will also participate in the &lsquo;Ring the Bell for World Investor Week&rsquo; campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This global initiative organised by the World Federation of Exchanges and spearheaded by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, brings together stock exchanges worldwide to promote investor education and protection.</p>
<p>InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest 2024, expected to draw over 11,000 visitors to Mid Valley Exhibition Centre (MVEC), will feature 40+ exhibitors and 600 free financial planning sessions under <b>#FinPlan4u</b>.

<title>ESMA Publishes First Consolidated Report On Sanctions</title>

<div> regulator, supervisor, administrative sanctions, financial sectors, convergence 
Summary:<br />The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its report on administrative sanctions imposed by National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in EU Member States in 2023. The report highlights the large number and value of administrative fines across EU Member States in the financial sector, with a focus on the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). The report also emphasizes the need for more convergence between NCAs in the exercise of their sanctioning powers. ESMA aims to foster consistent implementation of capital markets rules and ensure similar breaches lead to similar enforcement outcomes across the EU. The underlying data is available for download, and a snapshot of the key findings is published. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1333_Annual_Sanctions_Report.pdf">first consolidated report on sanctions and measures</a>&nbsp;imposed by the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in Member States in 2023.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>In 2023, more than 970 administrative sanctions and measures were imposed across EU Member States in financial sectors under ESMA&rsquo;s remit. The aggregated value of administrative fines amounted to more than 71 million EUR. The highest amounts of administrative fines were imposed under the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Overall, the report highlights that there is still room for more convergence between NCAs in the exercise of their sanctioning powers.</p>
<p>The use of sanctions is only one of multiple tools in the NCA&rsquo;s supervisory toolkit, and supervisory effectiveness cannot be measured solely based on the number or value of the sanctions imposed in a Member State. The consolidated report does not provide a full picture of national enforcement activities; for example, these may also include more informal actions, and not all criminal sanctions are included in the scope of the report.</p>
<p>The data on the use of sanctions included in this report was reported to ESMA by the NCAs. In line with the ESMA Strategy 2023-2028, the consolidated report contributes to supervisory and enforcement convergence and facilitates greater transparency on sanctions.</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p>Building on this report, ESMA will further foster the effective and consistent implementation of capital markets rules and ensure similar breaches lead to similar enforcement outcomes across the EU.</p>
<p>The underlying data is available in excel format and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1508_Consolidated_Sanctions_Report_-_Table_of_Sanctions.xlsx">here</a>. In addition, a snapshot of the report&rsquo;s key findings is published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1551_Enforcement_Snapshot.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<div> Global Business Optimism Insights Report, Q4 2024, Dun & Bradstreet, business optimism, inflation, monetary policies<br />
Summary:<br />
Business optimism increased by 7%, driven by easing inflation and favorable borrowing conditions. U.S., U.K., and Spain saw notable recoveries. Supply chain and financial confidence also improved. ESG initiatives increased. <div>
<p>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, today released its Q4 2024 Global Business Optimism Insights report. The report, fielded in Q3 2024, found a 7% increase in business optimism quarter-over-quarter, driven by gradual easing of inflation rates and favorable borrowing conditions.</p>
<p>Nearly four in five businesses are expressing increased optimism in domestic and export orders, capital expenditures and financial risk due to a combination of easing financial pressures, shifts in monetary policies, robust regulatory frameworks and higher participation in sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>U.S. businesses recorded a nearly 9% rise in optimism, aided by falling inflation and expectations of further rate cuts. Similarly, business optimism in the U.K. and Spain showed notable recoveries as their respective central banks initiated monetary easing, rising by 13% and 9%, respectively. Emerging economies, such as Argentina and India, saw jumps in optimism levels due to declining inflation and increased domestic demand respectively.</p>
<p>"While overall global business optimism has increased and inflation has abated, it's important to recognise that geopolitics contribute to economic uncertainty," said Neeraj Sahai, President of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International. "Industry-specific regulatory risks and more stringent data requirements have emerged as the top concerns among a third of respondents. To mitigate these risks, businesses are considering diversifying their supply chains and markets to manage regulatory risk." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key findings from the Q4 report's five indices include:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Business Optimism Index</b>&nbsp;increased by 7.3% over Q3 2024. This is a significant increase with 75% of businesses, especially smaller businesses, expressing confidence in sales and domestic and export orders ahead of the holiday season. The real estate (12.5%) and utilities (10.4%) sectors saw the highest jumps in optimism levels.</li>
<li><b>The Global Supply Chain Continuity Index</b>&nbsp;improved 6.8%, stemming from businesses reducing burdens on their supply chains by adopting nearshoring, using alternative and less-congestive routes, and relying on domestic supplies. One in four businesses in the U.S., as well as Switzerland and Spain, are considering diversifying supply chains and markets as their preferred strategy to manage their regulatory risk.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business Financial Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;increased 6.3% due to expectations of improved financial conditions and reduced borrowing costs as many economies have started to cut interest rates. Confidence in the U.S. and South Korea notably improved by 5.2% and 11.2%, respectively, on indications of their central banks pivoting towards looser monetary policies.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business Investment Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;improved 3.6%, showcasing optimism in capital spending centered around signs of global monetary policies becoming more accommodative, along with improvement in macroeconomic activities.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business ESG Index</b>&nbsp;increased by 6.1%, stemming from businesses' efforts to meet regulatory requirements, stricter disclosure mandates and heightened investor awareness. Globally, stricter environmental regulations, such as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, are among top concerns for 29% of businesses, resulting in almost one in four conducting risk assessments or implementing regulatory compliance strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Descriptions and information about the indices can be found on page 24 of the report.</p>
<p>"Businesses are increasingly confident as borrowing costs decline, boosting optimism for higher sales, stronger exports, and reduced financial risks," said Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. "This confidence is driving capital investments, with easing supply chain pressures supporting growth in the year's final quarter."</p>
<p><b>About the Global Business Optimism Insights Report</b></p>
<p>The Global Business Optimism Insights report is a synthesis of data from a comprehensive survey encompassing 32 economies, covering approximately 10,000 businesses and 17 sectors, alongside insights from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, leveraging the firm's proprietary data and economic expertise. The report is an amalgamation of five indices which reflect overall business optimism and expectations about supply chain continuity, financial and investment conditions and ESG initiatives. An index reading above 100 indicates an improvement in optimism relative to the base year (Q3 2023 to Q2 2024), while an index reading below 100 signifies a deterioration in optimism.</p>

<div> awards, BMLL, data science, hedge funds, market data
Summary:
BMLL won "Best Data Science Solution Provider" at HedgeWeek US Awards 2024, recognized for providing high-quality historical market data and analytics. Their platform supports start-up and large hedge funds. Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, highlighted the challenges that hedge funds face in obtaining high-quality historical market data and how BMLL addresses this issue by providing high-quality, Level 3, 2, and 1 historical order book data. BMLL’s platform not only simplifies access to deep market insights but also scales with the growing data needs of users. <div>
<p><span>We are delighted to announce that BMLL has won &ldquo;Best Data Science Solution Provider&rdquo; at the HedgeWeek US Awards 2024. These awards recognise excellence among fund managers and service providers in the US across a wide range of categories.</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL was awarded for providing harmonised, Level 3, Level 2 and Level 1 historical data and analytics to hedge funds, helping them improve predictability, quality and speed of alpha through a scalable, managed data and analytics service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The award recognises BMLL&rsquo;s support for start-up hedge funds such as Aleto, who leverage BMLL&rsquo;s data science platform to reduce set-up costs and shorten time to market, as well as BMLL&rsquo;s capabilities for supporting large systematic hedge funds with alpha generation and operational needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Specifically, BMLL helps quant teams deliver predictive alphas: using BMLL&rsquo;s suite of predictive analytics and scalable research, they can unlock patterns in market behaviour, improve signal generation and optimise algorithm performance at a fraction of the cost of building the capabilities in-house.</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL&rsquo;s ready-to-use, quant-built data science platform, provides hedge funds with the necessary research infrastructure to support their specific operation and growth from the outset, without the high upfront costs and lengthy timelines normally associated with launching a quantitative or systematic fund.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are thrilled to be named Best Data Science Solution Provider at the Hedgeweek US Awards 2024. Hedge funds face significant challenges in obtaining high-quality historical market data, as incumbent real-time data providers often only supply commoditised historical data that lacks the granularity and accuracy needed for effective quantitative strategy development. These data gaps can negatively impact strategy performance and lead to excessive resource allocation for data cleansing and normalisation.</span></p>
<p><span>At BMLL, we address this issue by providing hedge funds with high-quality, Level 3, 2, and 1 historical order book data that captures and displays the trading intentions of all market participants. This enables our clients to access clean, reliable data without the need for extensive in-house infrastructure, allowing them to focus on research and development. Our platform not only simplifies access to deep market insights but also scales with the growing data needs of our users, helping them optimise their strategies and stay competitive in a fast-evolving market.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>ASIC has cancelled two Australian financial services licences (AFS licence) and 11 Australian credit licences (collectively, the Licensees).</p>
<p>The Licensees were required by law to be a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). AFCA membership gives consumers access to a free, fair, and independent dispute resolution scheme if a complaint cannot be resolved internally by a Licensee.</p>
<p>ASIC works with AFCA to identify AFS licence and credit licence holders that do not comply with their obligation to maintain their AFCA membership.</p>
<p>If an entity is expelled from the scheme or requests to withdraw membership, AFCA must notify ASIC. Where an entity fails to comply, or is otherwise in breach of general conduct obligations, ASIC will continue to take action to cancel AFS licence or credit licences.</p>
<p>The Licensees have, varyingly:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>failed to be a member of AFCA</li>
<li>failed to lodge annual compliance certificates on time (credit licence holders)&nbsp;</li>
<li>failed to prepare and lodge an annual profit and loss statement and balance sheet (AFS licence holders)</li>
<li>failed to comply with a condition on the licence</li>
<li>failed to pay industry funding levies owed to ASIC</li>
<li>ceased to carry on a financial services business (AFS licence holders), and/or</li>
<li>ceased to engage in credit activities (credit licence holders).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the period 4 July 2024 and 10 July 2024, ASIC cancelled the AFS licences of:&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Under section 55 of the Credit Act, ASIC has the power to cancel a credit licence if a credit licence holder has contravened its general conduct obligations under section 47. This includes the obligation to be a member of AFCA and the obligation to comply with the credit legislation.

<div> Licensing, Registration, ASIC, Financial services, Professional<br />
Summary:<br />
ASIC provides an update on licensing and professional registration activities. It received 1,531 applications and granted 280 new AFS licences. It aims to improve its licensing processes using a new digital portal. <div>
<p>ASIC has provided an update on its licensing and professional registration activities to assist current and prospective Australian financial services (AFS), and credit licensees understand the licensing regime.</p>
<p>Report 797&nbsp;<em>Licensing and professional registration activities: 2024 update&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-797-licensing-and-professional-registration-activities-2024-update/" title="REP 797 Licensing and professional registration activities: 2024 update">REP 797</a>) provides the latest information on registration and licence applications from the 2023-24 financial year and key changes to licensing processes.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, &lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s licensing and professional registration function plays a key gatekeeping role by ensuring new licensees and registered professionals meet the necessary thresholds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The report provides guidance to AFS and credit licensees and financial services industry professionals about ASIC&rsquo;s rigorous licensing and professional registration decision-making processes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s licensing report also discusses current and emerging licensing issues including in relation to digital (crypto) assets, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services, and payments systems.</p>
<p>Between July 2023 and June 2024, ASIC:</p>
<ul>
<li>received 1,531 licensing and registration applications</li>
<li>finalised 1,246 applications for new and varied AFS and credit licences</li>
<li>granted 280 new AFS licences and 143 new credit licences</li>
<li>approved 495 AFS and credit licence variation applications from existing licensees</li>
<li>registered 113 company auditors, 45 self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) auditors and 17 liquidators, and</li>
<li>decided on 80% of new AFS licence applications and 75% of AFS licence variation applications within 150 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same period, 239 AFS licences and 204 credit licences were cancelled or suspended. In addition, 44 professional registration applications were withdrawn and two were refused.</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said, &lsquo;This year we are continuing to improve ASIC&rsquo;s licensing processes and systems through our stakeholder and applicant engagement process.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re also building a new digital portal for AFS licensees and applicants to make it easier and more efficient to apply for, maintain, and vary their licence, enabling a modern and user-friendly application process.&rsquo;</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Consults On Improving Retail Investor Access To Long-Term Asset Investments</title>

<div> Framework Proposal, Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund, Retail Investors, Investment Fund, Illiquid Assets
Summary:<br /><br />The Ontario Securities Commission proposed the Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund to allow retail investors access to illiquid assets through a new investment fund structure. The aim is to provide opportunities for diversification and potential higher returns while protecting investors and fostering capital formation. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/8/81-737/osc-consultation-paper-81-737-opportunity-improve-retail-investor-access-long-term-assets-through">published a consultation paper</a>&nbsp;aimed at improving retail investor access to illiquid investments through a framework proposal for a long-term asset investment fund product structure.</p>
<p>The consultation proposes the creation of a new investment fund category, the Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund (OLTF), which would allow Ontarians to invest in assets they may not traditionally have exposure to. These assets include venture capital, private debt and equity, and infrastructure and natural resource projects. OLTFs could offer opportunities for more retail investors to participate in capital-intensive projects, while enabling businesses to lower funding costs and raise the capital necessary for growth.</p>
<p>Investors would have an opportunity to diversify their portfolio across assets, but also across different types of businesses or projects. There are existing investment vehicles that would allow access to these assets, but many are privately funded and unavailable to retail investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long-term assets provide a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and potentially achieve higher returns over an extended period,&rdquo; said Raymond Chan, Senior Vice President, Investment Management. &ldquo;Through this consultation, we hope to identify how to broaden investor access to these benefits while also mitigating the risks inherent in illiquid assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-term assets are illiquid assets that cannot be readily disposed of, may be difficult to value, and generally have longer investment time horizons than other assets. An investment fund would provide retail investors with an investment vehicle whose regulatory framework is more specifically tailored to their needs.</p>
<p>The proposed new framework would allow retail investors to gain exposure to these long-term assets through the professional management of a registered investment fund manager and registered portfolio manager. Distribution through a prospectus-qualified investment fund product would mean that suitability, &ldquo;know-your-client&rdquo; (KYC) and &ldquo;know-your-product" (KYP) requirements would generally apply. The consultation also seeks feedback on investor access to OLTFs through order-execution-only, or &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; dealers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The long-term asset fund proposal aims to create a framework that protects investors while fostering innovation and capital formation,&rdquo; continued Chan.</p>
<p>The feedback received will guide the next phase of the proposal, which is anticipated to be the publication for comment of proposed rule amendments and policy changes.</p>
<p>Please submit comments in writing on or before February 7, 2025.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Office Hours With SEC Chair Gary Gensler: Fraud And Deception In Artificial Intelligence</title>

<div> fraud, manipulation, securities law, artificial intelligence, investor protection
Summary: Under securities law, AI can be used for fraud and manipulation. Deployers must ensure guardrails to prevent harm and be held accountable. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Tym3pO261Gc">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-transcript-fraud-deception-artificial-intelligence-101024#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>



</p>
<p>In 1950, the famous mathematician Alan Turing asked, &ldquo;Can machines think?&rdquo; What does that mean for securities law, particularly the laws related to fraud and manipulation?</p>
<p>Bad actors, ever since antiquity, have found new ways to deceive the public. With artificial intelligence, fraudsters have yet a new tool to exploit. But make no mistake. Under the securities law, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>Former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein recently wrote about what happens when you combine AI, finance and the law of fraud. She spoke of three types of harm.</p>
<p>The first: Programmable Harm. It's kind of straightforward. If someone uses an algorithm and is optimizing to manipulate or defraud the public, that's just fraud.</p>
<p>Gets interesting when we get to the second category: Predictable Harm. Again, I think it's reasonably straightforward. In essence, has someone recklessly or knowingly disregarded a foreseeable risk in deploying a particular AI model? In essence, did they act reasonably?</p>
<p>You see, under the securities law, you aren't supposed to trade in front of your customers. That's called front running. You aren't supposed to spoof. In other words, place a fake order. You aren't supposed to lie to the public. Well, it's equally important that the robots, I mean AI models, don't do these things either. Investor protection requires that the humans who deploy the model put in place appropriate guardrails.</p>
<p>Some might ask, what if the AI models themselves are self-learning? They're changing. They're adapting. What if the AI models hallucinate, which we all know sometimes they do. I still believe that those who deploy the AI models should have appropriate guardrails for that as well.</p>
<p>That brings up the third category. In essence, when firms might deploy an AI model that create Unpredictable Harm. How do we hold those firms responsible? While some of that might play out in court, I think right now the harms are mostly either programmable or predictable, because we do know that these models may self-learn, may hallucinate. We do know that there are things that you're not supposed to do, like lie to the public.</p>
<p>You know, there was a famous early movie executive, Joseph Kennedy. He also went on to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And his son became president. Well, what did Chair Kennedy say in this seat 90 years ago? He said, &ldquo;The Commission will make war without quarter on any who sell securities by fraud or misrepresentation.&rdquo; And I think he meant the AI model deployers as well.</p>

<br />
Private equity investments offer high returns in exchange for taking a certain level of risk. Manufacturing and natural resources have different volatility and Value at Risk (VaR). privateMetrics uses asset-level private equity indices. Proper private asset risk measurement requires different data that genuinely takes account of the evolution in the risk premia to which the investments are exposed. Indices and benchmarks reflect the level of market prices and the risk of each segment over time.
<br /><br />Summary: Private equity investments offer high returns but come with a certain level of risk. Manufacturing and natural resources have different volatility and Value at Risk. Asset-level private equity indices are used for proper risk measurement. <div>
<p><span>Private equity investments offer high returns in exchange for taking a certain level of risk. These risks result first and foremost in considerable return dispersion and sometimes, despite the long-term investment horizon, in exits in less favourable conditions than anticipated by investors. Private companies can also go bankrupt, but they are more likely to do so in certain segments of the private market. Stratifying the PE universe using the PECCS taxonomy, a range of risk/return profiles appears that suggest a wide range of risk-taking and return-seeking strategies (figure 1).</span><br /><br /><i>Figure 1: Dispersion of 10-year Volatility and Value at Risk (confidence interval 97.5%) of PECCS Activities in Europe</i></p>

<title>FinCEN Assesses Record $1.3 Billion Penalty Against TD Bank</title>

<div> settlement, TD Bank, violations, AML program, FinCEN
Summary:
The largest penalty of $1.3 billion was imposed on TD Bank by FinCEN for BSA violations and AML program failures. Independent monitorship and remediation required. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) assessed a record&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2024-10-10/FinCEN-TD-Bank-Consent-Order-508FINAL.pdf">$1.3 billion penalty</a>&nbsp;against TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (collectively, TD Bank, or the Bank) for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the primary U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) law that safeguards the financial system from illicit use. TD Bank is among the largest banks in the United States.</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s $1.3 billion settlement is the largest penalty against a depository institution in U.S. Treasury and FinCEN history. FinCEN&rsquo;s action also imposes a four-year independent monitorship to oversee TD Bank&rsquo;s required remediation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of financial institutions have partnered with FinCEN to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system. TD Bank did the opposite. From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank&rsquo;s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system,&rdquo; said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. &ldquo;Our historic action represents a significant step in safeguarding our country and communities from criminal activity like fentanyl and human trafficking by requiring TD Bank to fix the vast deficiencies in its safeguards against money laundering. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to taking action to keep our communities safe from the sort of behavior facilitated by illicit finance and enabled by TD Bank&rsquo;s lax oversight, and we are making clear that financial institutions will face severe repercussions if they fail to maintain necessary safeguards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For over a decade, TD Bank allowed its AML program to languish, making TD Bank a target for illicit actors&mdash;including its own employees,&rdquo; said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki. &ldquo;The magnitude of FinCEN&rsquo;s action is consistent with the harm that TD Bank&rsquo;s failures caused. This historic action should serve as a powerful reminder that we will not tolerate financial institutions who flagrantly violate their obligation to safeguard our financial system from criminal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, TD Bank admits that it willfully failed to implement and maintain an AML program that met the minimum requirements of the BSA and FinCEN&rsquo;s implementing regulations. FinCEN&rsquo;s investigation revealed that TD Bank knew that its AML program was neither appropriately designed nor adequately resourced to mitigate the actual illicit finance risks that it faced on multiple fronts. Among other failures, TD Bank&rsquo;s processing of peer-to-peer transactions (e.g., Venmo and Zelle), including transactions indicative of human trafficking, was insufficient, and as a result, TD Bank failed to identify and timely report these transactions to FinCEN. TD Bank also allowed significant backlogs of potentially suspicious activity to persist, thereby depriving law enforcement of necessary information. TD Bank knew that it was the subject of significant funnel account activity involving high-risk countries yet failed to take timely action to address this substantial risk.</p>
<p>TD Bank also failed to timely detect suspicious activity involving its own employees. For example, in 2021, a TD Bank employee facilitated the laundering of narcotics proceeds in exchange for bribes. This employee opened numerous accounts, including for shell companies, that then engaged in millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of funnel account activity in a high-risk jurisdiction where TD Bank maintained no operations. TD Bank knew that this type of activity was not subject to appropriate controls and failed to mitigate this glaring risk.</p>
<p>As a result of these failures, TD Bank allowed trillions of dollars in transactions annually to go unmonitored for potentially suspicious activity that would require reporting to FinCEN. Specifically, during the time period covered by the Consent Order, TD Bank willfully failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on thousands of suspicious transactions&mdash;totaling approximately $1.5 billion. Additionally, TD Bank&rsquo;s Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) of large cash transactions were often delayed, and, in some instances, misleading to law enforcement.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to properly limit or report suspicious transactions and cash activity that included substantial criminal activity, as further detailed in the Consent Order. For example, from 2017 to 2021, TD Bank facilitated over $400 million in transactions for Da Ying Sze (Sze), who pled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/queens-man-admits-orchestrating-653-million-money-laundering-conspiracy-operating" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guilty to money laundering</a>&nbsp;in 2022 for his role in conspiring to hide proceeds of narcotics trafficking. Sze conducted most of these transactions in large sums of cash (often in bags that Sze brought into TD Bank branches), yet the Bank failed to timely limit or restrict Sze&rsquo;s activity. TD Bank failed to timely file SARs on a substantial portion of this activity and also failed to identify Sze in more than 500 CTRs totaling more than $400 million, which hindered FinCEN and law enforcement.</p>
<p>TD Bank has agreed to engage an independent consultant, who, under the auspices of FinCEN&rsquo;s monitor, would conduct a historical analysis of TD Bank&rsquo;s transaction data, often referred to as a &ldquo;SAR lookback,&rdquo; to remediate the SAR filings that TD Bank missed due to its extensive control gaps. TD Bank has also agreed that the monitor will oversee an independent, end-to-end review of its AML Program. For the first time, FinCEN is imposing accountability and data governance reviews. The accountability review will independently assess the involvement or failure to escalate by TD Bank personnel in conjunction with certain conduct described in the Consent Order&rsquo;s Statement of Facts. The accountability review will provide corresponding recommendations to the Bank, including recommendations related to the culture of compliance at TD Bank. The data governance review will help to ensure that TD Bank identifies and fixes the root causes of many gaps in its AML program.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will also announce settlements in parallel investigations today.</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s Enforcement and Compliance Division is responsible for investigating serious violations of the BSA. For additional information regarding the facts and circumstances associated with this enforcement action, including the specific BSA violations and their underlying causes, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2024-10-10/FinCEN-TD-Bank-Consent-Order-508FINAL.pdf">Consent Order</a>&nbsp;between FinCEN and TD Bank.</p>

<div> Treasury Department, sanctions, AML laws, TD Bank, FinCEN<br />
Summary:<br />
Treasury Department penalizes TD Bank $1.3 billion for AML failures enabling drug trafficking, requiring remedial measures and a four-year monitor. Collaboration across agencies emphasized. <div>
<p>Thank you. I am glad to join Attorney General Garland, Deputy Attorney General Monaco, and the rest of you here today. I applaud DOJ&rsquo;s efforts. I won&rsquo;t speak to its case, but to the separate investigation that Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network undertook and the action we&rsquo;ve taken.</p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury utilizes sanctions and the enforcement of our country&rsquo;s anti-money laundering (AML) laws to protect our national security from illicit actors. From drug trafficking to combatting Russian aggression, the Treasury Department is committed to using all of the tools available to us to protect the American people.</p>
<p>We are proud of the public-private partnership we have formed with the financial sector to protect our national security. The vast majority of financial institutions work hand-in-hand with Treasury to keep our country and our communities safe.</p>
<p>TD Bank has done the exact opposite. For more than a decade, through deliberate actions&mdash;and inaction&mdash;TD Bank failed to meet its responsibilities.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to implement or maintain a sufficient AML compliance program.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to monitor trillions of dollars in transactions each year, including those the Bank knew posed a high-risk for abuse.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to conduct adequate due diligence on high-risk customers, ignoring glaring red flags.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to live up to its responsibilities to the American people.</p>
<p>I want to be clear, these systemic failures did not just create hypothetical vulnerabilities, but they resulted in actual, material harm to American citizens and communities. Time and again, unlike its peers, TD Bank prioritized growth and profit over complying with the law.</p>
<p>The bank enabled drug trafficking. In one example from FinCEN&rsquo;s investigation, TD Bank facilitated over $400 million in transactions to launder money on behalf of criminals that were selling fentanyl and other deadly drugs that are poisoning our neighborhoods. In exchange for filing false or misleading reports on these transactions, TD Bank tellers accepted gift cards as bribes. In another example, TD Bank failed to detect the suspicious activities of one of its own employees who was accepting bribes in exchange for opening accounts in the name of shell companies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why today we are announcing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&rsquo;s (FinCEN) $1.3 billion penalty on TD Bank, the largest civil monetary penalty against a bank in Treasury&rsquo;s history.<br />In addition to a historic penalty, TD Bank has agreed to a four-year monitor to oversee its extensive remedial measures, including end-to-end review of its AML program. The bank will also be required to provide missing suspicious activity reports and, for the first time, FinCEN will require additional accountability and data governance reviews to provide recommendations for changing TD Bank&rsquo;s culture of noncompliance.</p>
<p>Together, these requirements hold TD Bank accountable for its egregious and willful disregard of the law and the real harm it caused. This action demonstrates that we are committed to holding individuals and institutions accountable.</p>
<p>Let me end by thanking FinCEN, the IRS Criminal Investigation team, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of Justice for their collaboration. We look forward to continuing to work together to enforce our nation&rsquo;s laws and protect our national security.</p>

<div> fined, Toronto-Dominion Bank, anti-money laundering, U.S. operations, compliance<br />
Summary: 
The Federal Reserve fined TD Bank $123.5 million for anti-money laundering violations, requiring enhanced measures to comply with U.S. regulations. Canada's OSFI can assist in implementation. Various U.S. agencies are also taking regulatory actions. TD is pleading guilty to criminal charges. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday fined Toronto-Dominion Bank $123.5 million for violations related to anti-money laundering laws. The Board is also requiring TD to implement enhanced measures to comply with anti-money laundering laws and to correct its risk management deficiencies.</p>
<p>TD failed to conduct adequate risk management and oversight of its retail banking operations in the United States, resulting in a U.S. subsidiary being used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds. The Board's action will help ensure that TD operates in compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Board is requiring TD to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a new office in the United States dedicated to remediating the deficiencies identified in the order;</li>
<li>Relocate to the United States the parts of its anti-money laundering compliance program that are responsible for complying with U.S. law. This program will be subject to oversight by U.S. regulators;</li>
<li>Certify that sufficient resources and attention are allocated to correcting the firm's anti-money laundering deficiencies prior to issuing any dividends or capital distributions; and</li>
<li>Undertake a thorough and independent review of the firm's board of directors and management to ensure adequate oversight of the U.S. operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the home country supervisor of TD, can act in the implementation of these requirements as permitted by its legal authority.</p>
<p>This action is being taken in conjunction with criminal and regulatory actions that are being taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The penalties announced by the agencies total approximately $3.09 billion. The bank is also pleading guilty to criminal charges brought by law enforcement authorities.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Cumberland DRW For Operating As An Unregistered Dealer In The Crypto Asset Markets</title>

<div> charged, Cumberland DRW LLC, crypto assets, securities, registration
<br />
Cumberland DRW LLC charged with unregistered dealing of over $2 billion crypto assets as securities. SEC seeks injunction, disgorgement, and penalties.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="article-location-publishdate">The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Chicago-based Cumberland DRW LLC with operating as an unregistered dealer in more than $2 billion of crypto assets offered and sold as securities, in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws that are designed to protect investors.</p>
<p class="article-location-publishdate">According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, since at least March 2018 through the present, Cumberland has acted as an unregistered dealer by buying and selling crypto assets offered and sold as securities for its own accounts as part of its regular business. As alleged in the complaint, Cumberland publicly calls itself &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s leading liquidity providers&rdquo; in crypto assets and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week by trading with counterparties by the telephone or through its online trading platform, Marea. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint further alleges that Cumberland engages in trading crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts on third-party crypto asset exchanges as part of its regular business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal securities laws require all dealers in all securities to register with the Commission, and those who operate in the crypto asset markets are no exception,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU). &ldquo;Despite frequent protestations by the industry that sales of crypto assets are all akin to sales of commodities, our complaint alleges that Cumberland, the respective issuers, and objective investors treated the offer and sale of the crypto assets at issue in this case as investments in securities, and Cumberland profited from its dealer activity in these assets without providing investors and the market with the important protections afforded by registration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Cumberland with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Andrew McFall of the SEC&rsquo;s Market Abuse Unit and Kathleen Hitchins of the CACU and supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Paul Kim, and Mr. Tenreiro of the CACU. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Christopher Martin and Timothy Stockwell and supervised by Jack Kaufman and Mr. Tenreiro.</p>

<title>SEC Issues $12 Million Award To Joint Whistleblowers</title>

<div> whistleblowers, SEC, enforcement action, award, investor protection fund
Summary:<br />SEC awards $12 million to three whistleblowers for assisting in enforcement action. Whistleblower program offers awards of 10-30% for credible information leading to successful enforcement. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $12 million award to be split among three joint whistleblowers who provided critical information and assistance in an SEC enforcement action.</p>
<p>The joint whistleblowers provided the SEC significant information and extensive cooperation, which helped expand the scope of the investigation and the charges brought in the enforcement action and also saved the agency substantial time and resources. The joint whistleblowers met numerous times with SEC&rsquo;s enforcement staff and certain of the joint whistleblowers suffered hardships due to their whistleblowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whistleblowers play a key role in helping the SEC hold wrongdoers accountable,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower. &ldquo;Even where an investigation is already open, whistleblowers may contribute by providing new information about misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Payments to whistleblowers are made out of an investor protection fund, established by Congress, which is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.&nbsp;Whistleblower awards can range from 10 to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<title>OCC Issues Cease and Desist Order, Assesses $450 Million Civil Money Penalty, and Imposes Growth Restriction Upon TD Bank, N.A. for BSA/AML Deficiencies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced a cease and desist order and a $450 million civil money penalty against TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (bank), for deficiencies in the bank&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance program. Today&rsquo;s action also imposes a restriction on the growth of the bank and a measure designed to ensure that the bank invests sufficient resources to remediate its BSA/AML deficiencies in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TD Bank&rsquo;s persistent prioritization of growth over controls allowed its employees to break the law and facilitate the laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank&rsquo;s blatant risk management failures attracted illicit actors and are egregious and unacceptable,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;The OCC&rsquo;s coordinated and comprehensive action, including the imposition of an asset cap, will ensure that the bank focuses on building proper controls commensurate with its risk profile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC determined that the bank failed to develop and maintain a BSA/AML program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA and its implementing regulations. Deficiencies in the bank&rsquo;s BSA/AML program included those related to internal controls and risk management practices; risk assessments; customer due diligence; customer risk ratings; suspicious activity identification, evaluation, and reporting; governance; staffing; independent testing; and training, among others.</p>
<p>The OCC found that the bank had significant, systemic breakdowns in its transaction monitoring program. The bank processed hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions with clear indicia of highly suspicious activity, creating a potential for significant money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit financial transactions. The bank repeatedly failed to take appropriate and timely corrective action to address the highly suspicious activity and failed to properly emphasize BSA/AML compliance.</p>
<p>The bank had a systemic breakdown in its processes to identify and report suspicious activity, and a pattern or practice of noncompliance with the suspicious activity report filing requirement, resulting in numerous violations. The bank also violated currency transaction reporting requirements on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>The OCC action is being taken in coordination with concurrent actions by the Department of Justice, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The OCC-assessed penalty will be directed to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Rimar Capital USA, Inc. (Rimar USA), Rimar Capital, LLC (Rimar LLC), Itai Liptz, and Clifford Boro for making false and misleading statements about Rimar LLC&rsquo;s purported use of artificial intelligence, or AI, to perform automated trading for client accounts and numerous other material misrepresentations. The parties agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges and pay $310,000 in total civil penalties.</p>
<p>According to the SEC order, Liptz, owner and CEO of Rimar LLC and Rimar USA, with the help of Boro, a Rimar USA board member, raised nearly $4 million from 45 investors for the development of Rimar LLC, an investment adviser that was falsely described as having an AI-driven platform for trading securities. The order found that the Rimar entities, Liptz, and Boro also made misrepresentations about Rimar LLC&rsquo;s assets under management and its investment returns. In addition, the order found that Rimar LLC and Liptz obtained advisory clients using the misleading statements and that Liptz misappropriated company funds for personal expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through entities he controlled, Liptz lured investors and clients with multiple fabrications, including with buzzwords about the latest AI technology,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;As AI becomes more popular in the investing space, we will continue to be vigilant and pursue those who lie about their firms&rsquo; technological capabilities and engage in &lsquo;AI washing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Rimar USA, Rimar LLC, Liptz, and Boro consented to the entry of an order finding antifraud violations and to cease and desist from violating the charged provisions.

<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is to launch a set of Irish Base Power Futures as first for this market, and extend expiries for a series of products for the Japanese French and Dutch power derivatives markets from 25 November 2024.</p>
<p>Steffen Koehler, COO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>This current portfolio extension is our response to the calls from our markets in Europe and Japan. We are proud to be the first to launch power futures for the Irish market, as well as expand our already successful offering in Japan. In addition, we believe that the new long-term maturities for selected European markets will bring further support for renewables integration and, on the larger scale, the energy transition.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>With the launch of the new Irish offering, market participants will be able to trade EEX power derivatives products across 23 European EEX markets.</p>
<p>The new Japanese season expiries, extended from four to eight seasons, will provide additional opportunities to trade on this rapidly growing market.</p>
<p>In addition, the extension of expiries from six to ten calendar years for the French and Dutch power markets will complement the existing long-term futures offering of EEX, in support of PPA hedging on the exchange and renewables integration.</p>
<p>Long-term deals on the Spanish, Italian and German power markets have been growing in number and traded volume over the past two years, surpassing 10 TWh in 2024 so far.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>European Energy Exchange (EEX)</span>&nbsp;is a leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers. As part of EEX Group, a group of companies serving international commodity markets, it offers contracts on power, natural gas and emission allowances as well as freight and agricultural products.

<div> Civil Rights Movement, South Carolina, Entrepreneurship, Economics, Women
Summary:
- Dr. Lisa D. Cook shares her story of growing up, experiences in economics, and the role of entrepreneurs in the economy. She emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship, innovation, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her personal narrative adds a human touch to the discussion of economics and policymaking. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction, Jennet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Let me start by saying my thoughts are with all the people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia who have felt the force of Helene's and Milton's impact. I am saddened by the tragic loss of life and widespread disruption in this region. The Federal Reserve Board and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area. As we normally do in these unfortunate situations, we are encouraging institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the needs of their communities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>It is an honor to stand before you and speak to this group of audacious, innovative women. I am also very happy to be back in Charleston. I grew up in Milledgeville, Georgia, just about 250 miles down the road. Some of my fondest childhood memories of traveling in the South, especially as a Girl Scout, include South Carolina.</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk with you about the important role startups, new businesses, and entrepreneurship play in our economy from the perspective of a Federal Reserve policymaker. I also want to share a bit of my story. Just like many of you&mdash;including those who have started a business or those who dream of doing that someday&mdash;I have faced and overcome hurdles along a winding path.</p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong><br />I was born and raised in Milledgeville, where my mother, Professor Mary Murray Cook, was a faculty member in the Nursing Department of Georgia College and State University. She was the first tenured African American faculty member at that university. My father, Rev. Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain and then in senior leadership at the hospital there. My family lived through the events that brought Milledgeville out of a deeply segregated South. My sisters and I were among the first African American students to desegregate the schools we attended. I drew strength from the example set by my family, others in the Civil Rights Movement, and the village that raised me and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that was not the initial field of study I pursued. I entered Spelman College in Atlanta as a physics and philosophy major. After graduation, I had the honor of studying at the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar.</p>
<p>After Oxford, I continued my education at the University of Dakar in Senegal in West Africa. However, at the end of my year in Africa, it was the chance to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in East Africa where I discovered my love of economics. I hiked alongside a British economist, and, by the end of the trek, he convinced me that studying economics would provide me with the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time.</p>
<p>I went on to earn my Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley<a name="f1"></a>. Entering the economics profession came with its usual challenges, and, for women, a few more challenges existed. To this day, women are still underrepresented in economics. Women earned just 34 percent of bachelor's degrees in economics and 36 percent of Ph.D.'s in economics in 2022, the most recent available data from the U.S. Department of Education. The share of women earning those degrees rose only modestly from 1999, when women earned about 32 percent of economics bachelor's degrees and 27 percent of Ph.D.'s. The data stand in sharp contrast to all science and engineering degrees, including in social science fields, where women earned roughly half of degrees granted in 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Education was paramount in my family and was construed as a means of realizing the promise of the Civil Rights Movement and continual improvement of our society and economy. Of course, economics, like physics, is a field where math skills are vitally important. Between my mother, my aunts, and my extended family, I had essentially understood STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)-related jobs to be women's work. I was grateful to have these role models in my orbit to give me the confidence to undertake study in a STEM field.</p>
<p>Access and encouragement for girls to pursue study in math and science are a significant concern. Economist Dania V. Francis's research shows that Black girls are disproportionately under-recommended for Advanced Placement calculus.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The course is often a gateway for economics, for STEM classes, and for college preparation, in general.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>My mentors and role models encouraged careful study, teaching, and scholarship and helped me block out the voices saying I did not belong at each juncture. They encouraged my work and have been champions for me. As a result, I have been committed to serving as a mentor, as well. For several years, I was the director of and taught in the American Economic Association's Summer Program, an important training ground for disadvantaged students considering economics careers. Each year, the share of students who are women oscillated between 41 percent and 67 percent, much higher than the enrollment in undergraduate economics courses nationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;I told those students&mdash;and continue to tell them as they make their way through graduate programs in economics and through the economics profession&mdash;"You belong here. Your insights are unique, and the profession will benefit from them."</p>
<p>In my career as an economist, I studied, researched, and taught in roles at universities and worked in the private sector and in government before I was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate to become a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 2022. I am honored and humbled to serve in this role and proud to be the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors. As Fed policymakers, we make decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American by focusing on the dual mandate given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurs' Vital Role in the Economy</strong><br />In my years of conducting research and while at the Board, I have met many inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs who made important contributions to the economy. Many of them happened to be women who were very knowledgeable, creative, and inspiring. So I want to discuss the vital role entrepreneurship and new business creation play in our economy.</p>
<p>You might ask what interest I have in this subject, as a monetary policymaker focused closely on the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Well, this topic has interested me for a long time, and I conducted a fair amount of research on entrepreneurship and innovation before joining the Board. But the topic is also important precisely because of our dual mandate. To convince you of this, I will explain a few of the ways in which economists think about entrepreneurship, and how they relate to the dual mandate.</p>
<p>The first is the most basic: For many people&mdash;many millions, in fact&mdash;entrepreneurship or self-employment is a career choice.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;It is their preferred way of participating in the labor market and obtaining income for themselves and their families. They prefer to be their own bosses, with all the benefits and risks that entails.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;But whether they end up hiring others or not, self-employed individuals support the labor market by providing a job for themselves.</p>
<p>A second way economists think about entrepreneurship is a little broader: New business creation is a large contributor to overall job growth. In fact, new businesses punch above their weight. For example, during the handful of years before the pandemic, in a typical year only about 8 percent of all employer firms were new entrants, but these new entrants accounted for about 15 percent of annual gross job creation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;And research has found that this job creation effect is long lasting. Even though many new firms do not survive, those that do survive tend to grow rapidly over 5 to 10 years, largely offsetting the job losses from those firms that shut down.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A third way economists think about entrepreneurship, which I have explored in my own research, is that a small but critical subset of new firms are innovators&mdash;they introduce new products or business processes that change how we consume or produce.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;As such, they make large contributions to overall productivity growth over time. That is, innovative entrepreneurs help enable us to do more with less&mdash;and even more so if access to innovation participation is equitable.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;It is important that everyone, including women, historically underrepresented groups, people from certain geographic regions, and other diverse representative groups, can participate in the entrepreneurship and innovation economy. In my research, I have found that investors underrate the prospects of Black-founded, or simply outsider-founded, startups in early funding stages. Better assessment of the early stages of invention and innovation could broaden the range of new entrants and the ideas they contribute to their local communities and the broader economy.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the Dual Mandate</strong><br />So let's return to the dual mandate. You can now understand that self-employment and entrepreneurial job creation are relevant for our employment mandate. Indeed, one could argue that entrepreneurs are critical to Fed policymakers' efforts to promote maximum employment. And the productivity gains we reap from entrepreneurship are like productivity growth from any other source. When the pace of productivity growth increases, it allows for economic activity and wage growth to be robust while also being consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>The importance of business startups to our dual mandate objectives is why I have watched closely as various measures of new business formation have surged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Applications for new businesses jumped to a record pace shortly after the pandemic struck the U.S.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The pace of applications has remained elevated above pre-pandemic norms all the way from the summer of 2020 to the most recent data, even though the pace appears to be cooling some this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;At first, it might have seemed like these business applications were mainly being submitted by people who lost their jobs, or perhaps by an increase in "gig economy" work. There was doubtless some of that going on, but research and data since then have painted a more optimistic picture.</p>
<p>When researchers look across areas of the country, the pandemic business applications had only a weak connection with layoffs. The surge in applications persisted long after overall layoffs fell to the subdued pace we have seen since early 2021. The applications did have a strong relationship with workers voluntarily leaving their jobs. Some quitting workers may have chosen to join these new businesses as founders or early employees. And surging business applications were soon followed by new businesses hiring workers and expanding. Over the last two years of available data, new firms created 1.9 million jobs per year, a pace not seen since the eve of the Global Financial Crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>The industry patterns of this surge reflect shifts in consumer and business needs resulting from the pandemic and its aftermath. For example, in large metro areas, new business creation shifted from city centers to the suburbs, perhaps because of the increase in remote work. Suddenly, people wanted to eat lunch or go to the gym closer to their home, rather than close to their downtown office. Likewise, consumer and business tastes for more online purchases, with the shipping requirements that entails, are evident in the surge of business entry in the online retail and transportation sectors. But this is not only about moving restaurants closer to workers or changing patterns of goods consumption. There was also a particularly strong entry into high-tech industries, such as data processing and hosting, as well as research and development services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That may have more to do with developments like artificial intelligence than with the pandemic specifically, as I discussed in a speech in Atlanta last week.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Economists will spend years debating the various causes of the surge in business creation during and soon after the pandemic. Perhaps strong monetary and fiscal policy backstopping aggregate demand played some role, or pandemic social safety net policies, or simply the accommodative financial conditions of 2020 and 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Indeed, more research is needed and will be the subject of many dissertations in the near future.</p>
<p>I do think a large part of the story is ultimately a case of resourceful and determined American entrepreneurs, perhaps including some of you, responding to the tumultuous shocks of the pandemic. They, like some of you, stepped in to meet the rapidly changing needs of households and businesses. This points to a fourth way economists like to think about entrepreneurship, which is that entrepreneurship plays a big role in helping the economy adapt to change. Research suggests that entrepreneurs and the businesses they create are highly responsive to big economic shocks, and the COVID-19 pandemic was certainly a seismic shock.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;To be sure, the future is uncertain. It is unclear what the productivity effects of the pandemic surge of new businesses, particularly in high tech, will be.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;And whether that surge will continue is an open question; after all, the pre-pandemic period was a period of declining rates of new business creation, and the pandemic surge itself does appear to be cooling off recently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />For now, let me say that I am grateful that entrepreneurs continue to give us a hand in meeting our employment mandate, and whatever productivity gains we may reap in coming years as a result may help ease tradeoffs with inflation as well.</p>
<p>Finally, I will share one last story about why South Carolina will always hold a special place in my and my sisters' hearts. Every summer and at Thanksgiving, we would travel through the Palmetto State to our grandparents' house in Winston-Salem. Sitting in the back seat of the station wagon, we were entranced by the many colorful signs along Interstate 95 advertising what I, as a child, viewed as South Carolina's number one attraction: the South of the Border roadside amusement park. We begged our parents to stop every time. It was an epic struggle that went on for more than a decade. Once or twice they did relent, a sweet childhood victory! And here is the funny thing about travels&mdash;paths can cross. The timing is such that my sisters and I may have even been helped by a waiter named Ben, a young man from Dillon, South Carolina, who would go on to be Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke!<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></span>&nbsp;Perhaps it was the world's way of foreshadowing.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me here in Charleston. It is inspiring to meet this group of bold, entrepreneurial women in South Carolina, and I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>

<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. There is no single way to measure the number of self-employed individuals and related businesses, but it certainly numbers in the millions. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey indicates there are roughly 10 million unincorporated and 7 million incorporated self-employed individuals. Separate data on businesses from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that, as of 2021, there were about 25 million nonemployer and 800,000 employer sole proprietorships (<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nonemployer-statistics.html">Nonemployer Statistics</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html">Statistics of U.S. Businesses</a>).</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Gross job creation refers to all jobs created by entering and expanding establishments. Data are from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics, averaged for 2015&ndash;19. New firms' share of net job creation is much higher, but this is partly an artifact of measurement practices: Firms with an age less than one measured in annual data cannot contribute negatively to net job creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. "Business applications" refers to applications for new Employer Identification Numbers submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. The last period of robust productivity growth in the U.S., the late 1990s and early 2000s, was preceded by several years by strong business creation in high-tech industries; see Lucia Foster, Cheryl Grim, John C. Haltiwanger, and Zoltan Wolf (2021), "Innovation, Productivity Dispersion, and Productivity Growth," in<em>&nbsp;</em>Carol Corrado, Jonathan Haskel, Javier Miranda, and Daniel Sichel, eds.,&nbsp;<em>Measuring and Accounting for Innovation in the Twenty-First Century</em>&nbsp;(Chicago: University of Chicago Press).&nbsp;</p>

<div> fined, TSB Bank plc, arrears, controls, redress
Summary:<br />TSB Bank plc fined £10,910,500 for unfair treatment of customers in arrears, lacked suitable controls, paid £99.9m in redress, breached FCA Principles. <br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined TSB Bank plc (TSB) &pound;10,910,500 for failing to ensure customers who were in arrears were treated fairly.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>It also lacked suitable systems and controls to secure fair outcomes. TSB has paid &pound;99.9m in redress to the 232,849 mortgage, overdraft, credit card and loan customers affected.</span></p>
<p>Between June 2014 and March 2020, TSB&rsquo;s inadequate processes created a real risk that repayment plans were not realistic. Its training did not fully support its staff in understanding customers&rsquo; circumstances. Staff were potentially encouraged by incentive schemes to prioritise the number of plans made over taking enough time to assess individual customer circumstances.</p>
<p>As a result of its failings, TSB risked agreeing unaffordable payment arrangements with customers in difficulty or charging them inappropriate fees. This risked increased uncertainty and stress, including for vulnerable customers.</p>
<p>The extent of the failings were identified by an independent review into TSB&rsquo;s treatment of customers who had fallen into arrears, which had been ordered by the FCA in July 2020.</p>
<p>TSB had become aware of potential problems with its collections and recoveries in December 2016. However, it was not until the review in 2020 that TSB took effective action to fully address them.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, commented:</p>
<p>'If you get into difficulty, you hope for &ndash; and we expect &ndash; fair treatment so a stressful situation isn&rsquo;t made worse. TSB&rsquo;s woeful systems and controls exposed its customers to risk of harm and meant it missed opportunity after opportunity to do the right thing. While it did take action, it took us instigating a review before it acted effectively to address all the issues.'</p>
<p>TSB has worked closely with the independent reviewer and the FCA and has concluded a comprehensive programme to resolve these issues, costing &pound;105m. The FCA continues to supervise all firms to ensure that they have suitable processes in place to support struggling customers.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<li>TSB would have been fined &pound;15,586,500 but it agreed to resolve these matters so qualified for a 30% discount under the FCA&rsquo;s processes.</li>
<li>The FCA requested that a Skilled Person be appointed to review TSB&rsquo;s collections and recoveries in September 2019, following concerns raised both during its own supervision work and by TSB itself. This work was carried out between 2020 and 2023.</li>

Summary:
The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) report discusses financial risks, global conditions, and policy recommendations for regional stability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The&nbsp;ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) today launched its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.SH2rn1fYDrsFUom0sxl58FhGbWqFSIYaLL4F7TPOgCtWp8pDETO-2F3Ern4JGcBTtj4P4hzbL2D-2BqyfopJRXRuohIOCeszmuIF0VToLDgTtCA-3Dl-4L_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ-2FbfYjrnmw7FS9tH-2Ft9pdIxIDlVc0RCVS1lpR9yQYOBxZqBfK-2Bl1M3bAsJCgy0pMaEB7J86WZsZu7En5jqaO1OcsE418csKCdEZ29qeIXFRQPgmADFmz2VFKnS8llrGhW4d2KK9s4YWNsMPD6qyc29aTfUHOvpwE8qeqvVGMk8ZgqsQC0ry5-2B0F6HsGShevYzmFfJNM5WVZzRViACIEGskAavBz-2FY4sBJnp6X-2BJSmHqQ64f7La9wyMp2TRKMhLh5QNPQXISjae4Xf4OzxQt6WD3qJZJLqyC1DE9HeFxIfPAg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>ASEAN+3 Financial Stability Report (AFSR 2024)</b></a>, which analyzes the latest market developments and potential risks within the ASEAN+3 region, while offering comprehensive analyses on some key challenges confronting the region.&nbsp;Since December 2023, financial risks in the ASEAN+3 region have evolved: while some risks (high inflation, higher for longer interest rate) have subsided, others (geopolitical tensions) have intensified. The region is poised to face a wide range of risks and challenges to financial stability in the near- to long-term.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgfbd2left"><img align="middle" alt="   " id="prnejpgfbd2left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2048913/AMRO_ColorRGB_FA_Logo.jpg" title="   " /></div>
<p>The first half of 2024 experienced an easing in global financial conditions as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) concluded its policy rate hiking cycle. Market movements were primarily influenced by expectations around the Fed's actions. However, in the third quarter of 2024, uncertainties about the US growth outlook, compounded by the unwinding of yen carry trades, sparked notable market volatility. The Fed commenced its monetary easing in September, which has led to an easing of monetary conditions, but uncertainties around inflation and growth outlook linger. Moreover, the geopolitical situation in the Middle East remains fragile and the result of the upcoming US presidential election remains a major source of uncertainties for financial markets.</p>
<p>"Overall, the risk to financial stability across ASEAN+3 in 2024 appears lower than in 2023. The current climate of robust growth and disinflation presents regional policymakers an opportunity to reduce debt, rebuild policy space, and strengthen fiscal capacity to better manage potential shocks. Replenishing foreign exchange reserves during times of capital inflows can further enhance market confidence and provide a buffer against extreme market volatility," said AMRO Chief Economist Hoe Ee Khor.</p>
<p>The thematic studies in AFSR 2024 provide an in-depth analysis of the specific risks confronting the region. ASEAN+3 remains vulnerable to macro-financial shocks from major advanced economies and other external factors, while&nbsp;the growing interconnectivity of ASEAN+3 financial systems underscores the need to take a holistic macroeconomic and financial view of the region to safeguard against systemic risks.</p>
<p>The real estate market downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and high inflation has raised additional concerns, as weakened demand and tighter financial conditions in several economies have severely impacted the financial health of property developers, leading to declining profitability, liquidity, and debt servicing capacity. Robust capital buffers in the banking sector appear to have mitigated spillover risks from the property market, but less visible threats from smaller local banks and shadow banking activities related to the property sector lurk, requiring close monitoring and may necessitate regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>The region's heavy reliance on the US dollar for cross-border financial activities poses two major risks: 1) a potential shortage of US dollar funding, which could destabilize financial markets and intermediaries; and 2) the transmission of global shocks through the US dollar, particularly during periods of monetary tightening or geopolitical tension.</p>
<p><b>Policy recommendations</b></p>
<p>In the near term, ASEAN+3 economies should remain vigilant against the risks of a resurgence of inflation, escalating geopolitical tensions, and a global growth slowdown. Continuous monitoring of international spillovers is crucial, alongside enhancing regional macroeconomic and financial surveillance and cooperation. Critical measures include strengthening cross-border surveillance and data sharing, conducting regional stress testing, enhancing home-host supervision, and strengthening the regional financial safety net.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measures to stabilize the property sector should be implemented to prevent fundamentally sound companies from defaulting due to tight credit conditions&nbsp;driven by a worsening market, while enhancing&nbsp;the soundness&nbsp;of financial institutions&nbsp;with significant exposure, especially smaller banks and nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).</p>
<p>To strengthen resilience against external shocks in a dollar-dependent environment, ASEAN+3 economies should reinforce their economic and financial fundamentals, enhance surveillance frameworks for monitoring US dollar liquidity, fortify macroprudential measures for banks and NBFIs, and provide financing support to member economies experiencing US dollar liquidity stresses. Furthermore, reducing structural reliance on the US dollar in the medium- to long-term by promoting the use of local currencies and developing cross-currency payment systems should be a key priority.</p>
<p>"To tackle the near- to long-term risks and challenges to ASEAN+3's financial stability, the region must come together as one and strive for resilience and stability," emphasized Dr. Khor.</p>

<title>Acuiti And SGX Group Launch Global Derivatives Market Sentiment Index</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acuiti-and-sgx-group-launch-global-derivatives-market-sentiment-index/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acuiti and Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released the SGX Global Market Sentiment Index, a barometer of sentiment from across the global derivatives market.</p>
<p>The Sentiment Index is based on a quarterly poll of Acuiti&rsquo;s Expert Networks, comprising senior, derivatives-focused executives from hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms and the sell-side.</p>
<p>Each quarter, Acuiti surveys Expert Network members on their outlook for the next three months to compile the benchmark. The report also draws on data compiled by Acuiti over the past 12 months to build the historic data.</p>
<p>Going forward, the report will provide a temperature check on sentiment across the market, with an analysis of what is driving change across company types.</p>
<p>This first report found that overall industry sentiment was positive in Q3 2024 with 68% of respondents feeling optimistic about the three months ahead. This was an increase from 65% last quarter.</p>
<p>The increase in optimism was driven by a strengthening of sentiment from the sell-side and proprietary trading firms.</p>
<p>However, for some, particularly asset managers, the volatility experienced during the quarter came as an unwelcome development as fears for performance over the rest of the year dented confidence.</p>
<p>Overall, however, 2024 is shaping up to be another record year for volumes across the global derivatives market and sentiment generally remains positive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with SGX Group to launch the SGX Global Market Sentiment Report. The report aggregates data that we collect from across our global networks and provides in one report a snapshot of sentiment across the derivatives market,&rdquo; says Will Mitting, founder of Acuiti.</p>

<title>SET Market Report For September 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Federal Open Market Committee, interest rate cut, U.S. stock markets, Thai equities, SET Index<br />
Summary:<br />
FOMC announced a rate cut, boosting U.S. stock markets. Thai equities rallied on domestic tailwinds, with SET Index closing at a 6.6% gain. TFEX daily trading volume increased in September. Thai stock market's forward P/E ratio and dividend yield ratio at the end of September. Newly listed companies on SET and mai in September. <div>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 0.5 percentage point cut in its policy interest rate to the target range of 4.75 percent &ndash; 5.0 percent. This marked the first rate cut in over four years, aimed at balancing risks to employment and inflation target. U.S. stock markets reacted positively, signaling that investors no longer expect a recession. Historically, The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts have boosted emerging market equities. Recent foreign capital inflows into ASEAN bourses spurred rallies in most regional stock indices in September, led by Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore, in descending order.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that Thai equities rallied on domestic tailwinds, including a clearer political landscape following the new Prime Minister's appointment, stronger-than-expected Thai economic growth, and increased institutional investment driven by stock market-related measures. This performance coincided with a strong rebound of foreign buying volume, which reached a 22-month high and triggered a rapid appreciation of Thai baht. However, the sensitivity analysis suggests that the currency strength may hurt future earnings forecasts of export and tourism stocks, while domestic pure-plays and import-intensive manufacturers may benefit from lower costs. The SET Index registered a notable upswing with heavy trading volume in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for</b><b> </b><b>September</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2024, the SET Index closed at 1,448.83 points, up 6.6 percent from the previous month - the highest gain since August 2021. The benchmark index rose 2.3 percent from the end of 2023. </li>
<li>Thai stocks rose across the board. For the nine months to September, industry groups that outpaced the SET Index were Technology, Consumer Products, and Agro &amp; Food Industry.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in September 2024 increased 26.4 percent over the same period last year and 35.8 percent from the preceding month to THB 62.5 billion (approx. USD 1.94 billion). For the first nine months of 2024, the daily trading value averaged at THB 46.48 billion.&nbsp; </li>
<li>In September, one newly listed company on SET was Petchsrivichai Enterprise pcl (PCE), and two newly listed on mai were SEI Medical pcl (SEI) and PMC Label Materials pcl (PMC).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of September 2024 was 15.8 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 13.0 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.5 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 15.6 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of September 2024 was 3.28 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.04 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in September 2024 averaged 707,472 contracts, up 41.9 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first nine months of 2024, TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume dropped 13.5 percent over the same period last year to 474,728 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

Earlier this year, Arf merged with Huma Finance, integrating its liquidity solutions into Huma's PayFi network.

<div> Keywords: Interbrand, brand value, Apple, automotive brands, luxury brands<br />
Summary: Interbrand's 25-year analysis emphasizes the importance of long-term brand investment, with Apple leading despite a drop and automotive and luxury brands showing resilience.

<ul type="disc">
<li><b>25 years of Interbrand data shows the financial consequence of focusing on performance marketing over long-term brand investment</b></li>

<p>Global brand&nbsp;consultancy Interbrand today launched its annual&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.wrLxKGHf-2BZMfLEH6Xvy2ArSC-2BvkHhlFIcSIHhZQQ4Dii6cfNRlsXeMCMFWHLLlb7H15f_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ0Zm7xgpZDmgntgaaDlv19Yj4MGJEXqupF5q0ONFDV0Yz1sE7CcqIumt0B1BEBMvaNlZDPYwKOS6Agyr08YK4HjjNa-2FHw6-2BcTFQZoLS7UuOUFZuNpIVzTzoZzljDpSBFp3DaqcadFtE4bUFEXtsMb-2F3hnB6CRqW8PZQZXQD6CLS0X1g4lWNKd8Ebaq0LecQq0njJjM-2B2fEzYZRHpugMnS1cy066mEeORXPmrY0M43M2l2bzoV73jrnzhtHjbxQ-2Fe7VBT4LXPzh9N9SZ-2BKGCcpqVdAnBWBHp46LPUdejZkXqk-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Best Global Brands</a>&nbsp;ranking, marking a quarter of a century of brand valuation analysis.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpge8ebleft"><img align="middle" alt="Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2024" id="prnejpge8ebleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526717/Interbrand_Best_Global_Brands_2024_Infographic.jpg" title="Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2024" /></div>
<p>Since 2000, Interbrand's longitudinal study has tracked and reported on the value of the world's biggest brands. A quarter century of analysis reveals that while performance marketing tactics can drive short-term financial gains, a lack of investment in long-term brand strategy has left the Best Global Brands with at least $3.5T of unrealized value. For this last year, this equates to $200B of lost revenue.</p>
<p>The cumulative value of the world's most valuable brands has increased 3.4x since Interbrand first published its ranking (from $988B USD to $3.4T USD).</p>
<p>Gonzalo Bruj&oacute;, Global CEO, Interbrand said: "If these brands had been treated and managed as strategic growth assets, then this table could be worth as much as $6.9T. The growth we see hides a staggering missed opportunity."</p>
<p><b>Apple holds the top spot</b></p>
<p>Apple remains the most valuable brand, but its brand value has dropped for the first time in over two decades (-3%).</p>
<p>Commenting on Apple, Greg Silverman, Global Director of Brand Economics, Interbrand said: "While others rushed into AI, Apple took a more deliberate path to ensure its AI releases matched its values. This slower-moving act of leadership has put long-term trust ahead of short-term revenue gains. Following these brand moves, Apple's stock has moved up 20% YTD and we anticipate that Apple's value will increase in the 2025 rankings."</p>
<p><b>Automotive brands dominate 2024</b></p>
<p>14 of the top 100 brands of 2024 are automotive, making up more than any other sector in the ranking. Three auto brands &ndash; Toyota (#6), Mercedes-Benz (#8) and BMW (#10) &ndash; appear in the top 10. However, not all auto brands have achieved such success. Tesla (#12) has one of this year's largest declines in brand value (-9%). Meanwhile, Kia (#86), Hyundai (#30) and Toyota (#6) achieved double digit growth.</p>
<p><b>Top-tier luxury shows resilience through innovation</b></p>
<p>Luxury's brand value continued an upward trajectory (+7%, up from + 6.5% last year), extending relevance by creating new consumer experiences and expanded digital touchpoints, demonstrating powerful creativity that taps into the human condition.</p>
<p>Ferrari (#62) captured this year's spot as the top-rising brand, with +21% brand value growth. Louis Vuitton jumped three places (#14 to #11) with Herm&egrave;s (#22) and Prada (#83) two of the biggest luxury brand risers this year, seeing brand value growth of +15% and +14% respectively.</p>
<p><b>Meet the 2024 new entrants</b></p>
<p>Nvidia (#36), Pandora (#91), Range Rover (#96), and Jordan (#99) are this year's new entrants &ndash; and Jordan is the first personality brand to make it onto the table. Uber (#78) and LG (#97) re-enter.</p>
<p><b>Marketing landscape changes over 25 years</b></p>
<p>Over the past 25 years, Interbrand has observed a significant shift in the ways company boardrooms approach growth. C-Suites are prioritizing lower total investments with more immediate returns. Strategies that integrate long-term brand equity with short-term revenue gains are becoming the gold standard &ndash; but these strategies are still surprisingly rare.</p>
<p>Bruj&oacute; said: "Performance tools, capabilities and systems have evolved over the past quarter century. As these tools shift, so do the pressures and expectations placed on brand and marketing leaders. Today, CMOs are expected to deliver greater revenue returns, in shorter time frames, for a&nbsp;lower investment.</p>
<p>"Many of the world's most valuable brands are missing out on significant earning potential by over-investing in short-term gains. Our analysis shows these gains, when tied predominantly to short-term tactics, can undermine a company's mid- to long-term revenue potential."</p>

<div> sentenced, fraud, false statements, securities, Telegram chat groups
Summary: 
Mr Oon Yun Cong was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment and fined for making false statements to induce others to deal in shares in Telegram chat groups. Investigations were conducted by MAS and Singapore Police. Mr Goh was also convicted for similar offences. <div>
<p>Mr Oon Yun Cong was yesterday sentenced to 16 months&rsquo; imprisonment and fined $12,105.70 for fraudulently inducing others to deal in shares under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA).</p>
<p>2.<span> </span>Between 30 April and 23 November 2020, Mr Oon made false statements on 10 occasions in two Telegram chat groups<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2024/court-convicts-oon-yun-cong#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;to induce members in these chat groups to purchase shares in the securities held by him. His false statements included overstating his target sell price for the securities and claiming that he had purchased shares in the securities when he had not.</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>During this period, Mr Oon also conspired with his friend, Mr Goh Jia Poh, Kenneth<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2024/court-convicts-oon-yun-cong#2">[2]</a></span>, to make similar false statements on six other occasions in the same Telegram chat groups to induce members to purchase shares in securities counters where he and/or Mr Goh held shares.</p>
<p>4.<span> </span>On 12 August 2024, Mr Oon pleaded guilty to and was convicted of two charges of making false statements to induce others to trade under section 200(1)(a) of the SFA. One other charge under section 200(1)(a) of the SFA was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.</p>
<p>5.<span> </span>Mr Oon&rsquo;s conviction was a result of a joint investigation conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force. The investigations against Mr Oon arose from referrals by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> CFTC-regulated, options, VIX futures, volatility, Cboe <br />
Summary:
Cboe launches new Options on VIX Futures physically settling into front-month VIX futures, offering risk management tools for managing market volatility. The launch complements existing volatility offerings. IMC US, Prime Trading, and Melqart KEAL Macro Fund welcome the expansion and will incorporate the new product in their portfolios. The contracts will have European-style exercise, P.M. settlement, and will be regulated by the CFTC and cleared by the OCC. A webinar will be held on October 11 to discuss the trading ease and accessibility of Options on VIX Futures. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>New&nbsp;CFTC-regulated options on futures will physically settle into front-month Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) Futures</li>
<li>Designed to offer market participants the ability to more granularly manage volatility</li>
<li>Further expansion of Cboe's volatility complex following launch of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced its new Options on Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) Futures (Ticker: UX) are planned to begin trading on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) on Monday, October 14.</p>
<p>The new Options on VIX Futures will provide investors an additional tool to help manage U.S. equity market volatility, complementing Cboe's existing securities-based VIX Index options, which are designed to provide similar risk management and yield enhancement capabilities. Utilizing an option-on-future structure, the new product may allow more market participants, including those restricted from accessing securities-based options, to trade a VIX options product.</p>
<p>Cboe's VIX Index options have seen record trading volumes during the last two years, with average daily volumes reaching over 851,000 contracts in 2024, up approximately 60% from 2022, as more investors have sought utility the options offer.</p>
<p>"Investors have long utilized VIX options and VIX futures to help hedge and manage volatility exposure, and Cboe is proud to expand our volatility product suite at such a critical time," said Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "With its options-on-futures structure, the new Options on VIX Futures will look to meet growing customer demand as Cboe works to provide an efficient and seamless experience to both existing and new CFE market participants. The launch will complement our existing volatility offerings, including the recently launched Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance futures, and enable more investors with the ability to help manage volatility and risk through the election season and beyond."</p>
<p>"20 years after Cboe launched VIX futures, followed by VIX options, and helped establish volatility as an asset class, we continue to prioritize product innovation, engage with our customers and bring new exchange-traded volatility derivatives to market," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "We believe there is a strong demand for risk management tools, especially as investors prepare for the upcoming election and the recent change in the Fed's monetary policy. We've seen a shift in how investors are using options on a day-to-day basis, and with Options on VIX Futures having a mid-curve structure and the ability to offer short-term exposure, investors are expected to be able to manage short-term volatility with greater precision."</p>
<p>Christine Hansen, CEO at IMC US, said: "We are proud to support the expansion of listed volatility offerings from Cboe to meet the varying needs of investors"</p>
<p>Tom Chlada, Chief Operating Officer at Prime Trading, said: "Prime's investment philosophy is to protect and grow capital, and Cboe's new Options on VIX Futures will be a very welcomed addition to our toolkit, enabling us to better express views on volatility and fine-tune our risk management approach. We believe the new options will help boost participation and trading opportunities in the volatility space, and we look forward to incorporating this tool in our portfolios."</p>
<p>Keith DeCarlucci, Chief Investment Officer at Melqart KEAL Macro Fund, said: "VIX futures and options play an important role when managing portfolios, and we welcome Cboe's further expansion of its exchange-traded volatility tools with Options on VIX Futures. Combined with the recent variance futures launch, we have two new products to leverage."</p>
<p>Options on VIX futures will have European-style exercise, P.M. settlement and physically settle into front-month VIX future. At launch, CFE will list contract expirations for every day the week of October 21 with two additional Friday expirations. Each weekday beginning October 21, CFE plans to list a new contract for trading expiring on the same weekday in the week or weeks following.</p>
<p>The contracts will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and cleared by The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC).</p>
<p>The upcoming launch of Options on VIX Futures follows the recent launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4274862-1&amp;h=3145069619&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Ftradable_products%2Fvariance_futures%2F&amp;a=Cboe+S%26P+500+Variance+(VA)+futures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures</a>, which are designed to offer a streamlined approach to trading the spread between implied and realized volatility. Both products add to Cboe's existing volatility suite and provide investors with exchange-traded solutions to manage market volatility ahead of and following the U.S. election.</p>
<p>On Friday, October 11 at 8:30 am ET, Cboe will be hosting a webinar with speakers from Allspring Global, IMC Financial Markets, and Golden Horse Fund Management on how Options on VIX Futures can enhance trading ease and accessibility. To register for the webinar, please&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4274862-1&amp;h=1124207522&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2F6217271956347%2FWN_Rg95Lf3vQpigZP5lca4c_g&amp;a=click+here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<title>SEC Charges Three So-Called Market Makers And Nine Individuals In Crackdown On Manipulation Of Crypto Assets Offered And Sold As Securities</title>

<div> fraud charges, market manipulation, crypto assets, securities, retail investors
Summary: SEC announces fraud charges against companies and individuals for manipulating markets for crypto assets offered as securities to retail investors. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against three companies purporting to be market makers and nine individuals for engaging in schemes to manipulate the markets for various crypto assets being offered and sold as securities to retail investors. As alleged, the schemes were intended to induce investor victims to purchase the crypto assets by creating the false appearance of an active trading market for them.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaints, crypto asset promoters Russell Armand, Maxwell Hernandez, Manpreet Singh Kohli, Nam Tran, and Vy Pham (Promoters) hired so-called market makers ZM Quant and Gotbit to provide market-manipulation-as-a-service, which included generating artificial trading volume or manipulating the price of crypto assets that the Promoters offered and sold as securities to retail investors in unregistered transactions. The SEC also alleged that ZM Quant and a third so-called market maker, CLS Global, undertook similar schemes to manipulate the market of a crypto asset offered and sold as a security that was created at the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of its parallel investigation into potential market manipulation in the crypto asset industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s enforcement actions demonstrate, once more, that retail investors are being victimized by fraudulent activity by institutional actors in the markets for crypto assets,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;With purported promoters and self-anointed market makers teaming up to target the investing public with false promises of profits in the crypto markets, investors should be mindful that the deck may be stacked against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that ZM Quant and its employees Baijun Ou and Ruiqi Lau, Gotbit and its employee Fedor Kedrov, and CLS Global and its employee Andrey Zhorzhes manipulated markets on behalf of the Promoters by self-trading (commonly referred to as &ldquo;wash trading&rdquo;) on popular crypto asset trading platforms or by engaging in other trading practices that likewise served no economic purpose, and that they used algorithms (or bots) that, at times, generated quadrillions of transactions and billions of dollars of artificial trading volume each day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remain concerned about the ease with which the market for a crypto asset can be manipulated and are committed to rooting out instances of such misconduct when it involves securities,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit (CACU). &ldquo;The wrongdoers behind these schemes are profiting handsomely at the expense of investors that have been deceptively lured into these markets and lost their hard-earned savings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s five complaints, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, allege that all defendants violated the antifraud and market manipulation provisions of the securities laws and that certain defendants violated registration provisions. The complaints seek permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties against all the defendants, as well as officer and director bars against certain defendants. Armand, Hernandez, and Pham consented to bifurcated settlements, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining them from further violations of the federal securities laws, subjecting them to conduct-based injunctions, and barring them from acting as officers or directors. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and any civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, which today announced parallel criminal actions.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations were conducted by David D&rsquo;Addio, Amy Harman Burkart, Ivan Panchenko, Jeffrey Cook, and John McCann in the SEC&rsquo;s Boston Regional Office, as well as Colin Missett and Joy Guo of the CACU. They were supervised by Amy Gwiazda, Michael Brennan, Donald Battle, and Mr. Tenreiro of CACU and by Celia Moore and John T. Dugan of the Boston Regional Office. The team also thanks the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology for their assistance. The litigations will be led by Mr. D&rsquo;Addio and Ms. Burkart.</p>

<title>SEC Charges “Magic Mushroom” Company And Two Individuals With Multimillion Dollar Pump-And-Dump Scheme</title>

<div> SEC, Minerco Inc., pump-and-dump scheme, fraudulent activities, stock manipulation <br />
Summary: SEC charges Minerco Inc., Shumake, and Jenge for pump-and-dump scheme, defrauding investors, false statements, seeks injunctions and penalties.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Minerco Inc. (former over-the-counter ticker: MINE), Bobby Shumake Japhia, and Julius Makiri Jenge, for their roles in an alleged pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors out of approximately $8 million while generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten proceeds from sales of Minerco stock.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, in the fall of 2019, Shumake, who was formerly known as Robert Samuel Shumake, Jr., secretly gained control of a large stock position in Minerco, an inactive penny stock company, and then arranged for Jenge to assume control of Minerco. The defendants then began pumping Minerco&rsquo;s stock price by promoting Minerco as the &ldquo;first publicly traded company focused on the research, production, and distribution of psilocybin mushrooms.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/psilocybin">Psilocybin</a>&nbsp;is the principal psychoactive component in &ldquo;magic mushrooms,&rdquo; a plant-based hallucinogen.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2021, the defendants allegedly continued to pump Minerco stock by making public statements and disclosures that contained false and misleading information. For example, Shumake and Minerco allegedly issued press releases falsely suggesting that an independent third party had valued Minerco at $1 billion and that Minerco had partnered with a Jamaican company that would lend expertise in growing a unique strain of psilocybin and bequeath to Minerco its Jamaican cannabis licenses. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleges that Jenge and Minerco falsely claimed in public disclosures that Minerco was an active Nevada company when, in reality, its charter had been revoked. Finally, Shumake allegedly engaged an offshore company to &ldquo;dump&rdquo; his Minerco shares and ultimately transfer at least $3.4 million in ill-gotten gains to an entity Shumake controlled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged here, pump-and-dumps often begin when cheap stock of dormant companies is suddenly touted by a promoter as the next big thing,&rdquo; said Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action serves as an important reminder that the SEC will remain steadfast in its efforts to root out of the market stock offerings that are more about hype than substance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC previously obtained an Order compelling Jenge to produce documents and appear for testimony pursuant to an investigative subpoena issued by the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Minerco, Shumake, and Jenge with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties against each defendant, as well as conduct-based injunctions and penny stock and officer-and-director bars against Shumake and Jenge.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by Adam Eisner, Brittany Garmyn, Keith O&rsquo;Donnell, and Zachary Scrima and supervised by C. Joshua Felker and Ms. Hodgman. Damon Taaffe will lead the litigation team under the supervision of David Nasse. The SEC appreciates the assistance of FINRA, OTC Markets Group, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Jamaica Financial Services Commission, the Qu&eacute;bec Autorit&eacute; des March&eacute;s Financiers, the Capital Markets Board of T&uuml;rkiye, and the Belize Financial Services Commission.</p>
<p>The SEC encourages investors to take&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-0">certain steps to identify</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/pump-and-dump-schemes">pump-and-dump schemes</a>&nbsp;involving the stocks of dormant shell companies.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Publishes Gamification Research And Launches New Trading Simulation Tool For Investor Education Month</title>

<div> report, OSC, gamification, investors, trading simulation<br />
<br />
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) released a report on the impact of gamification on investors, launching a trading simulation tool to test online trading behaviors. Summary: OSC report on gamification impact, new trading tool, social engagement influences behavior, findings guide regulatory response.<br /> <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today released a new report that studied the impact of gamification on investors. Along with this research, the OSC launched a new trading simulation tool for investors to test how online gamification tactics can influence their investing behaviour.</p>
<p>The report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/gamification-revisited-new-experimental-findings-retail-investing">Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span>&nbsp;looks at whether promoting certain assets on digital investing platforms presents a risk to investors. The tool,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://getsmarterabouttrading.ca/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">GetSmarterAboutTrading.ca<span>&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">provides people with a chance to participate in a simulated stock market and practice online trading. It exposes users to gamification techniques to show them what could be influencing their investing behaviour.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Digital investing platforms are increasingly popular and make it easier for retail investors to participate in financial markets, but there is growing regulatory concern over the use of gamification techniques on these platforms,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;The research we published today, along with the GetSmarterAboutTrading tool will help people better understand the impact of gamification techniques on their trading behaviour and help investors make more informed decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OSC conducted an experiment where participants received virtual &ldquo;money&rdquo; to invest in fictional stocks on a made-up trading platform. Participants took part in simulated trading where stocks were promoted in different ways. The research found two types of promotion had a significant impact on participants&rsquo; trading behaviours; those who saw promoted stocks featured on a social feed traded 12% more in those stocks, and those who had the option to copy the trades of a &ldquo;high performing&rdquo; user traded 18% more in the promoted stocks.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that these social engagement techniques can influence investor behaviours by encouraging trading in specific assets. This influence is likely to have a negative impact, potentially through under-diversification or excessive risk taking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/gamification-revisited-new-experimental-findings-retail-investing">Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</a>&nbsp;builds on the work of an earlier OSC research report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-796/digital-engagement-practices-retail-investing-gamification-other-behavioural-techniques"><em>Digital Engagement Practices in Retail Investing: Gamification and Other Behavioural Techniques</em></a><em>.</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The 2022 report included the results of an online experiment showing the impact of &ldquo;points&rdquo; and &ldquo;top-traded lists&rdquo; on user trading.The experiment found participants rewarded with points for buying and selling stocks made 39% more trades and those who saw a list of top traded stocks were 14% more likely to buy and sell those stocks. More frequent trading generally has a negative impact on investor returns.</p>
<p>The OSC&rsquo;s research into gamification is an important example of taking evidence-informed approaches to securities regulation. This report also contains several recommendations for how regulators and authorities in Canada and abroad might respond to the ongoing use of digital engagement practices by online investing platforms. This could include updates to regulations and guidance for digital trading platforms and potentially limiting problematic digital engagement practices that research indicates can compromise investor protection.</p>
<p>October marks Investor Education Month in Canada, and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/?p=home" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">World Investor Week</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>a global initiative of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, takes place October 7-13. Today&rsquo;s launch is part of OSC efforts to raise awareness about the importance of investor education and protection.</p>

<p><span>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a><span>.</span></p>

<div> Guidelines, redemption, token holders, crisis, issuer
Summary: 
The EBA published final Guidelines on token holder redemption in issuer crises, covering ARTs and EMTs, with amendments for clarity and flexibility. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Guidelines on the orderly redemption of token holders in case of crisis of the issuer. The Guidelines, which are addressed to competent authorities designated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), cover issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and of e-money tokens (EMTs).</span></p>
<p>The Guidelines&nbsp;specify the content of the redemption plan to be developed by issuers of ARTs and EMTs in going concern, including the liquidation strategies of the reserve of assets, the mapping of critical activities, the content of the redemption claims, the main steps of the redemption process, and the elements that may lead to the trigger of the plan by the competent authority.</p>
<p>Considering the feedback received during the public consultation, a&nbsp;few targeted amendments have been made to streamline the wording and provide further clarity on some specific aspects. For instance, some clarifications allow for flexibility so that the guidance addressed to issuers of ARTs relating to the liquidation of the reserve of assets can be used, to some extent, also by issuers of EMTs.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The Guidelines on redemption plans&nbsp;have been developed according to Article 47(5) of MiCAR. By virtue of the cross-reference set out in Article 55 MiCAR, the Guidelines also cover&nbsp;issuers of e-money tokens, as applicable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, Steve, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>Yesterday I shared my historical perspective on the discount window at Davidson College.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In 1913, when the Federal Reserve was established, the discount window was the main tool it used to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. More than 110 years later, the discount window continues to play an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and the effective implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today I would like to discuss with you how the discount window has evolved in the 21st century, including recent steps the Federal Reserve Board has taken to solicit feedback from the public on discount window operations. Before I address our most recent efforts, however, I will review some important episodes in discount window history that brought us to where we are today.</p>
<p>First, I will recount briefly events in the 1980s and early 1990s that provide important context for the reappraisal of the discount window in the early 2000s. Second, I will summarize revisions to the discount window that the Fed made in 2003 and some additional changes made since then. Third, I will describe efforts that the Fed has taken to ensure that the discount window remains effective today, including the request for information that the Board recently issued on operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit. After completing my discussion of the discount window, I will conclude with my outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>Events before the 2003 Discount Window Revisions</strong><br />I would like to pick up today where I left off yesterday in my speech at Davidson College: the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a period of widespread problems in the commercial banking sector. Troubled institutions borrowed from the discount window for extended periods of time as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the closure of these institutions. As a result, the discount window became associated strongly with lending to troubled institutions. Healthy banks' reluctance to borrow from the discount window increased. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This led to a reassessment of the discount window in the early 2000s and to eventual revisions implemented in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>A Reassessment of the Discount Window in the Early 2000s</strong><br />The key challenge in the reassessment of the discount window was to establish a lending program that would not only operate effectively and support monetary policy implementation, but also mitigate moral hazard and provide sufficient controls to minimize risk to Reserve Banks and, ultimately, to American taxpayers. After the reassessment, the Fed implemented several changes aimed to achieve the right balance.</p>
<p>The Board replaced the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a below-market rate, with a new type of discount window credit called primary credit. This new type of discount window credit became effective in 2003.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It is available as a backup source of liquidity to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition at an above-market rate. Making the discount rate a penalty rate is more consistent with the long-standing practice of other major central banks. This feature was intended to reduce the need for administrative pressures based on Reserve Bank staff judgment of inappropriate usage when the discount rate was below market rates. Although those measures effectively limited usage that was deemed inappropriate at the time, they also presented communication challenges regarding when it was appropriate to use the discount window and perpetuated the perception that the Fed discouraged its use.</p>
<p>Primary credit is a "no questions asked" facility in which eligible depository institutions are no longer required to have exhausted other sources of funding or be subject to restrictions on the use of the borrowed funds. The Fed initially set the primary credit rate 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Since March 2020, the Fed has set the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>At the same time primary credit was established, another new program, called secondary credit, replaced the extended credit program. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It was initially available at an interest rate 50 basis points higher than the primary credit rate, which is the spread in effect today. In contrast to primary credit, extensions under secondary credit are subject to higher collateral discounts and may involve ongoing oversight on the use of funds obtained under the program, reflecting the less-sound condition of secondary credit borrowers. Typically, Reserve Banks review a depository institution's plan to repay the loan and return to market sources of funding.</p>
<p>This two-tiered structure of providing the no-questions-asked primary credit program for healthy depository institutions and the secondary credit program for less-than-healthy depository institutions was designed primarily to instill public confidence in the health of institutions borrowing from the primary credit program and to reduce the reluctance of healthy depository institutions to borrow.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In addition, having two separate facilities would reinforce the notion that healthy and troubled depository institutions alike should regard borrowing from the Fed as an option in the event of a need for additional funds.</p>
<p>In the early years of the switch to the new facilities, there were signs that healthy depository institutions became more willing to borrow from the discount window. For example, some research found that after the 2003 discount window revisions, banks borrowed more from the discount window when the federal funds rate spiked than they had previously.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This finding suggests that the redesign of the discount window was effective in reducing banks' reluctance to borrow. As a result, the discount window may have been more effective in placing a ceiling on short-term funding rates, aiding the implementation of monetary policy, and serving as a liquidity tool when needed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to measure reluctance to borrow from the discount window. When the interest rate on primary credit is above the target federal funds rate and the federal funds rate is close to its target, the aggregate volume of primary credit is expected to be low. In other words, a low average level of discount window borrowing does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow; instead, it could simply reflect a situation in which depository institutions do not currently need to borrow. In addition, when there is an abundance of liquidity in the banking system, as is the case in the current ample-reserves monetary policy regime, depository institutions may have less need to obtain additional liquidity via the discount window. Again, this does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow. Conversely, the presence of discount window borrowing does not necessarily reflect the absence of a reluctance to borrow. It could be the case that, although aggregate usage increases, there are still some depository institutions that are willing to pay well above the primary credit rate even when they could have borrowed readily from the discount window. For these reasons, it is important that we complement data with market outreach information to assess the effectiveness of the discount window.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and Challenges since the Introduction of Primary and Secondary Credit</strong><br />Primary and secondary credit exist today, but some changes have been made to primary credit since its inception. For example, although the discount window was used extensively and played an important role in the emergency measures taken during the financial crisis of 2007&ndash;09, some depository institutions during this period still were willing to borrow funds from the market at rates above the discount rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This suggested that there was a reluctance to borrow before the crisis, and that reluctance appeared to grow over the course of the crisis. To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets and provide depository institutions with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding, the Board approved temporary changes to its primary credit discount window facility during the crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in late 2007, the Board established the Term Auction Facility (TAF).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Concerns about lending to troubled depository institutions reemerged after the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 2010, Congress required the Fed to publish detailed individual institution borrowing data with a two-year lag.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This action was intended to enhance the transparency and accountability of Federal Reserve lending while still preserving a measure of confidentiality to avoid discouraging depository institutions from borrowing.</p>
<p>More recently, in March 2020, the Fed announced changes to the provision of primary credit that were intended to encourage depository institutions to use the discount window to meet demands for credit from households and businesses in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes included setting the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the federal funds target range&mdash;a step that enhanced the ability of the discount window to support trading within the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate&mdash;and communicating the terms of borrowing as 90 days, prepayable and renewable on a daily basis. To further encourage depository institutions to use the discount window, the Fed also made changes to its reporting of Reserve Bank&ndash;level aggregate weekly discount window borrowing. It consolidated amounts previously reported as "loans," which include discount window borrowing, into a broader category of assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The changes made in 2020 remain in effect.</p>
<p>During and after the spring 2023 stress events, the discount window again played an important role in supporting both monetary policy and financial stability. Depository institutions that came under severe stress turned to the discount window. The discount window also served an important role in providing ready access to funding, especially for depository institutions experiencing spillovers from the bank failures. To further ensure that depository institutions had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, the Board announced the creation of a new emergency program, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). Although the BTFP was established pursuant to the Board's emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the BTFP used the discount window infrastructure to lend to eligible depository institution borrowers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;By relying on the existing discount window infrastructure, the BTFP was able to begin operating right away. The program ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024, as scheduled.</p>
<p>Today the discount window continues to be an effective tool, but it is important to acknowledge that economic and banking conditions continue to evolve. Since the 2003 discount window reassessment, we have seen an increased focus on liquidity in banking regulation, including the advent of quantitative liquidity requirements for large banking organizations; technological changes in the banking system; a general trend toward faster and 24-7-365 payment systems; changes in the composition and posture of Federal Home Loan Bank lending; and the move to an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve System has taken important steps to ensure that the discount window performs its functions successfully in the 21st-century economy. For example, last year the Board, along with the other federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration, issued guidance on contingency funding plans that encouraged depository institutions to be ready to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;This includes taking steps to establish borrowing relationships with the Federal Reserve, such as providing certain legal documentation and ensuring that collateral to secure loans is ready to pledge. In connection with interagency initiatives, Reserve Banks have conducted outreach to depository institutions and made efforts to guide them in using the discount window.</p>
<p>Data suggest that this encouragement is working. By the end of 2023, 3,900 banks, or roughly 80 percent of all banks, had completed the legal documentation required to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Of those, nearly 2,000 banks had pledged collateral, with an aggregate lendable value of over $2.6 trillion after applying appropriate discounts. These figures are notably above their levels at the end of 2021 and 2022. Although I am pleased to see the improvements in discount window readiness statistics, continued outreach is still important. To that effect, this summer, Federal Reserve Banks hosted an Ask the Fed&reg; session to discuss the purpose of the discount window, its facilities, and recommendations for depository institutions on how to prepare to borrow from the Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Reserve System has made important investments to enhance the technology that supports discount window activities. Earlier this year, the System launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to request and prepay loans as well as securely message their local Reserve Bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Discount Window Direct generally is accessible 24 hours a day. We are actively encouraging the use of Discount Window Direct.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking Feedback on the Discount Window</strong><br />To complement our efforts to enhance discount window operations, the Federal Reserve Board recently announced that it is collecting feedback from the public on operational frictions associated with the discount window and intraday credit through the issuance of a request for information. As some of you may know, a request for information is a formal document through which a government agency solicits feedback. Members of the public can submit comments in response to the request for information until December 9, 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a></p>
<p>The Board requests input on various discount window and intraday credit operational practices, such as the process for requesting, receiving, and repaying discount window loans as well as Reserve Bank discount window and intraday credit communications practices. Through the request for information, the Board hopes to gain further insight into the operational aspects that are the most costly or burdensome for depository institutions. This will help the Fed consider further improvements to promote efficiency and reduce burden on depository institutions. Ultimately, the Fed's goal is to build on the current discount window operations and processes so that the discount window will continue to provide ready access to funding against a wide range of collateral in the future. I encourage members of the public to submit comments on the request for information, and I look forward to considering the feedback that we receive.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />Before concluding, let me share with you a summary of my outlook for the U.S. economy, as I did yesterday with the audience at Davidson. Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Jefferson (2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For more details about this period, see Clouse (1994). In response to the wave of depository institution failures, Congress placed legal limitations on Federal Reserve lending to troubled institutions. Specifically, section 142 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) amended section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act to place restraints on discount window lending to undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized insured depository institutions. FDICIA also imposed liability on the Board of Governors for excess losses incurred by the FDIC that are attributable to lending beyond those limits. The provisions of FDICIA were intended to reduce moral hazard in the banking system and limit taxpayer losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For more details, see the October 31, 2002, Federal Reserve press release (Board of Governors, 2002b) and the final rule implementing the changes (Board of Governors, 2002a).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In 2003, when primary credit was implemented, there was a single federal funds target rate. The Federal Open Market Committee adopted a federal funds target range on December 16, 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For details on the change to the rate spread announced in March 2020, see the press release (Board of Governors, 2020). As will be discussed in greater detail later, before 2020, the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate (or top of the target range) had changed a few times to address economic conditions during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. This design feature also would help Reserve Banks manage risk more easily by establishing a standardized approach and risk controls when lending through a facility reserved for troubled depository institutions. Loans to troubled depository institutions entail more risk to the lending Reserve Bank, and depository institutions that are undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized are subject to lending limitations under FDICIA.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See Bernanke (2009a) and Madigan (2009) for a retrospective that elaborates on some of the emergency measures taken during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the reasoning for discount window rate changes during the financial crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Throughout this crisis, the Board approved numerous reductions in the primary credit rate and narrowed the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate twice. With the narrowing of the spread in August 2007 from 100 basis points to 50 basis points and in March 2008 to 25 basis points, the Board announced that the maximum term for primary credit loans would be extended, first to 30 days and then to 90 days, respectively. As economic conditions improved, in 2010, the Board increased the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate to 50 basis points and shortened the maximum term for primary credit loans to overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. The TAF provided fixed quantities of term credit to depository institutions through an auction mechanism and seemed to have largely addressed banks' concern that borrowing from the Federal Reserve would imply weakness. According to Bernanke (2009b, paragraph 7), this was "partly because the sizable number of borrowers provides a greater assurance of anonymity, and possibly also because the three-day period between the auction and auction settlement suggests that the facility's users are not using it to meet acute funding needs on a particular day."&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. As with the discount window, an eligible institution participated in the BTFP through its local Reserve Bank. The legal agreements and process for pledging securities in the BTFP also relied on those used in discount window lending. Nevertheless, the BTFP differed from the discount window in various ways, including the term of lending, scope of eligible collateral, collateral valuation, and interest rate. For more information on the differences between the BTFP and the discount window, see the response to question A.3 in Board of Governors (2024a, p. 3).

<div> Report, Investor Education, Crypto-Assets, Risks, Regulation
<br />
IOSCO released a report on crypto-asset investor education. It highlights risks, regulatory changes, and the need for financial literacy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>IOSCO is pleased to release its Final Report on Investor Education surrounding Crypto-Assets. This Report summarizes the results of a survey distributed to members of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee for Retail Investors (C8) in autumn last year about retail investor behaviour, demographics, and experiences with crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Crypto-assets have been a key priority for IOSCO for some time and in 2022 it established a Board-level FinTech Task Force to develop, oversee, deliver and implement IOSCO&rsquo;s work with respect to FinTech and crypto-assets. Early work has shown that investors are drawn to invest in crypto-assets for three key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of missing out&rdquo;      (&ldquo;FOMO&rdquo;) or as a speculative investment;</li>
<li>Low cost of entry; and</li>
<li>Advice from friends      and/or social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD769.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917581430%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0LGr%2FUUPTFWUWuvBLJfCCSztwgdjVWxYIWvxS%2FIPvug%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Final Report</a> highlights examples of regulatory changes and enforcement activity by C8 members since the <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD668.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917610936%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=PiFrAW5%2B2uHm6z6G9UO6%2BqDc%2BXU7p2pA0C7tjbdiXEQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">related 2020 report</a>, as well as current priority issues around investor education in the crypto-asset space, such as relationship investment scams and the need to communicate with retail investors on, and about, social media.</p>
<p>The Report suggests specific investor education messages which C8 members could consider when driving forward education of crypto-assets in their local jurisdiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Investments in crypto-assets can be      exceptionally risky and these assets are often volatile.</em></li>
<li><em>Investors should be wary of investments      promoted on social media and use skepticism when following &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>Crypto-asset investments might lack basic      investor protections, as those offering crypto-asset investments or      services may not be complying with applicable law, including registration      and licensing requirements.</em></li>
<li><em>Investments offered in compliance with a      jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory framework confers investors with certain      investor protections.</em></li>
<li><em>Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising      popularity of crypto-assets to lure retail investors into scams, often      leading to devastating losses.</em></li>
<li><em>Understanding the nature of investing      generally, including having an investing plan, and understanding risk      tolerance and time horizon, as well as understanding the nature of      investing in crypto-assets, can be critical to overall and long-term      investing success.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO, commented: &ldquo;<em>With such growing widespread interest in crypto-assets, retail investors are subject to unique risks. Market events have shown that the industry carries high levels of volatility, failures, and bad actors causing harm to investors and the markets.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is not surprising, therefore, that crypto-asset education is one of IOSCO&rsquo;s top priorities and forms a big part of this year&rsquo;s World Investor Week, which highlights a number of common challenges that we all face as financial regulators and as financial consumers.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking place over the course of this week, IOSCO&rsquo;s annual World Investor Week is a platform to promote financial education and literacy. <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldinvestorweek.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917627842%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=htx%2F5VgIUb3S92SUDfTE%2F%2F%2FYCzuCRQ58uUsC%2Fypzcek%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Servais added: &ldquo;<em>Financial education is a complementary tool to regulation and supervision to enhance investors&rsquo; awareness, critical sense and rational behaviour. Financial literacy must go hand in hand with appropriate investor protection measures, fair advice, supervision and enforcement of rules.</em>&rdquo;</p>

Summary:<br />
Eventus and Bitnomial announce partnership for trade surveillance. Bitnomial selects Eventus Validus platform to enhance market surveillance capabilities. Bitnomial Exchange sees record growth. <br />Summary:<br /> <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions,&nbsp;and Bitnomial, Inc. a digital asset derivatives exchange company that operates CFTC regulated exchange, clearinghouse and settlement businesses, today announced that Bitnomial Exchange has selected the Eventus Validus platform for all of its trade surveillance needs. Bitnomial sought a comprehensive, scalable trade surveillance solution as the firm has grown extensively and expanded into new products and business lines.</p>
<p>Bitnomial and Eventus have had a strategic partnership since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">May 2021</span>, when Eventus began providing seamless integration of order and execution flow on behalf of two large futures commission merchant (FCM) clients that are members of the exchange. Bitnomial Exchange's decision to deploy Validus followed a review of both internal trade surveillance capabilities and the offerings of Eventus and other external providers as the exchange decided how best to build on its internal surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Michael Dunn</span>, President of Bitnomial Exchange, commented on the news: "We are thrilled to adopt Eventus' Validus platform to enhance our market surveillance capabilities. This partnership builds on our years of collaboration to support our mutual customers and deliver a secure, transparent and highly efficient trading experience. Integrating Eventus' advanced surveillance tools with our proprietary, in-house surveillance system strengthens our commitment to compliance and transparency, while reinforcing the trust our clients place in Bitnomial Exchange."</p>
<p>Eventus CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Travis Schwab</span>&nbsp;said: "Bitnomial continues to see phenomenal growth as an exchange business that can meet the needs of the most discerning institutional investors. Our extensive experience in digital assets globally, combined with internal markets and regulatory expertise and a best-of-breed solution, all played a role in this selection. We're excited to build on our relationship and serve as a trusted partner supporting Bitnomial's continued growth and the integrity of its markets."</p>
<p>In August, Bitnomial Exchange announced record growth for the quarter ending on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">June 30</span>&nbsp;and over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$130 million</span>&nbsp;in notional value traded during the first half of 2024, representing a 1,081% increase during the same period in 2023. The&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>-based exchange offering physically settled&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;futures and options was founded in 2014 to provide a regulated, secure environment for institutional and professional traders to participate in&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;derivatives markets. Late last year, the CFTC approved Bitnomial's clearinghouse, and the exchange recently introduced Hashrate futures in partnership with Luxor targeting&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;miners.</p>

<div> technology, ISDA Ops, risk management, automation, Validus<br />
Summary:<br />
Validus introduces ISDA Ops for automated ISDA ATE and CSA Threshold calculation, real-time risk management, enhanced reporting, scenario analytics, and integration with existing platforms. <div>
<p>Validus Risk Management (&lsquo;Validus&rsquo;), a leading independent financial risk advisory and technology firm, has introduced ISDA Ops, a groundbreaking solution aimed at automating the calculation and monitoring of complex ISDA Additional Termination Events (ATEs) and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) Thresholds.</p>
<p>The solution provides an intelligent and scalable approach to constructing ATE and CSA Threshold conditions. The new platform significantly enhances efficiency by simplifying the management of ISDA and CSA terms, offering a streamlined approach for handling counterparty and liquidity risks.</p>
<p>The complexity of monitoring ATEs and CSA Thresholds has historically presented significant challenges for financial institutions. Using Validus&rsquo; proprietary technology, ISDA Ops was developed taking into consideration over 2,000 trading lines across more than 40 major counterparties, providing a monitoring platform, which allows users to analyse and test conditions using live and forecasted data. The tailor-made design of the Expression Builder provides complete flexibility, allowing full customisation and accommodating all possible terms. ISDA Ops empowers real-time proactive decision-making, enabling firms to manage collateral requirements and counterparty risk more effectively.</p>
<p>Key benefits of ISDA Ops include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Automated Tracking and Calculation:</b>&nbsp;ISDA Ops provides automatic calculation and tracking of ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds across all counterparties, ensuring seamless risk management.</li>
<li><b>Real-Time Risk Management:</b>&nbsp;Users can proactively make decisions in real time, significantly improving the management of counterparty and liquidity risks by identifying potential collateral calls early.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Reporting:</b>&nbsp;The platform provides intelligent reporting tools that simplify the process of tracking and updating ISDA terms, boosting transparency.</li>
<li><b>Scenario Analytics:</b>&nbsp;With the ability to test conditions using both live and forecasted data, ISDA Ops enable users to simulate potential future scenarios and proactively address potential risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ISDA Ops integrates with Validus&rsquo; Horizon platform, including RiskView, a configurable hedging monitoring and reporting framework, TradeView, a front-office hedging platform, and PortfolioView, a portfolio-level risk management platform. The new features enable&nbsp;CSA Thresholds to be updated and monitored within RiskView, proactively identifying potential collateral calls, while PortfolioView data is integrated for condition testing.</p>
<p><b>Alain Smith, Head of Client Engagement at Validus Risk Management, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Monitoring and managing ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds are crucial risk management functions but has historically proven a major challenge due to the scale and complexity of the task. ISDA Ops therefore represents a significant breakthrough for risk management teams &ndash; presenting a clear, consolidated view of the data and allowing users to identify breaches and model for future risks. Cutting-edge technology has made processing huge volumes of data possible, looking to the future our aim is to keep ISDA Ops at the forefront &ndash; deploying generative AI to deepen the capabilities of our game-changing solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Validus is scheduled to deliver further enhancements to ISDA Ops before the end of the year, using generative AI to efficiently parse complex language, scale the offering and drive faster data retrieval. The launch follows the announcement in June that Validus delivered several upgrades to TradeView, enabling automation pre-trade checks.</p>

</ul>
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, has published the results of its annual country classification review for countries monitored by its global equity and fixed income indices.</p>
<h4><span>Fixed Income</span></h4>
<p>FTSE Russell is pleased to announce that&nbsp;<span>South Korea</span>&nbsp;will be reclassified from Market Accessibility 1 to 2, and South Korean government bonds will be added to the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI), effective with November 2025 index profiles and phased in over a one-year period on a quarterly basis. Since being placed on the Watch List in September 2022, several initiatives intended to improve the accessibility of South Korean government bonds for international investors have been implemented by market authorities. Most recently, these efforts have facilitated connectivity with International Central Securities Depositaries in June 2024 for the South Korean bond market and permitted third-party foreign exchange for South Korean won starting in July 2024. Following this confirmatory announcement regarding index inclusion, FTSE Russell encourages global financial market infrastructure providers to continue their readiness activities to support future investment in the South Korean government bond market by WGBI users and leverage the benefits of the market structure reforms. FTSE Russell continues to welcome feedback from index stakeholders on such process to ensure a frictionless inclusion of the South Korea government bond market in the WGBI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nikki Stefanelli, Head of Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Index Policy at FTSE Russell, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We congratulate South Korean market authorities on their efforts to expand and encourage global investment in their local government bond market. FTSE Russell have closely monitored the capital markets reforms that have been implemented by South Korean market authorities over the past two years and their effectiveness in achieving the rigorous accessibility criteria for WGBI inclusion. We look forward to continuing to support the market as it undertakes readiness activities ahead of index inclusion at the end of next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mr. Sang-mok Choi, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Korea comments:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Over the last two years, the South Korean government has announced a series of initiatives to strengthen its capital markets for both domestic and international investors, which have now been successfully implemented. Over this time, we have had a positive engagement with FTSE Russell and international market participants on the impact of these efforts and their ability to facilitate inclusion of South Korean government bonds in the FTSE WGBI, which requires the highest level of market accessibility. We are pleased with the process, and more importantly the outcome with FTSE Russell&rsquo;s decision today.&nbsp; The MOEF are committed to continuing and strengthening its engagement with market participants to ensure a smooth index inclusion starting in November 2025, which will bring a welcomed increase in international investment in our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTSE Russell announces that the Market Accessibility Level for&nbsp;<span>India&nbsp;</span>will be reclassified from 0 to 1, and Indian government bonds will be included in the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI), starting in September 2025. This decision reflects the continued progress in the accessibility of the market for these securities for international investors and the growing importance of the Indian government bond market in mainstream global emerging markets bond portfolios. FTSE Russell thanks the Reserve Bank of India for its continued dialogue and commitment to facilitating international investment in its local market.</p>

Tradeweb FTSE closing bond prices are based on bid-side and offer-side price quotes supplied by market makers to Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic trading platform for institutional dealer and clients during a pre-determined collection window each day. The closing prices, which are derived from these quotes, offer index users a more representative, transparent and robust approach to valuing fixed income securities. In its role as benchmark administrator for these closing prices, FTSE Russell is in a unique position to ensure they are calculated in line with its rigorous governance standards.&nbsp;</p>

<title>A History Of The Fed's Discount Window: 1913–2000, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson, At Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hicks and Tara Boehmler, for the kind introduction.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected, including those in the Davidson College family. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>I am happy to be back at Davidson College. This is a special community. I am bound to it by a shared experience defined not by its length, but by its intensity. As I visited with you today, and as I look around this hall, I see the faces of colleagues who became dear friends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, we spoke often about the unprecedented uncertainty we faced. Amidst that uncertainty, however, we supported each other on this campus. Now, looking back, we can attest that this mutual support was vital. I am grateful to have been amongst you during that unprecedented time. Today, I am proud to see that Davidson is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>I am excited to be here with you this evening and to talk to you about the history of the Federal Reserve's discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The discount window is one of the tools the Fed uses to support the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and to implement monetary policy effectively. It was created in 1913 when the Fed was established. Today, more than 110 years later, this tool continues to play an important role. At the Fed, we always look for ways to improve our tools, including our discount window operations. Recently, the Fed published a request for information document to receive feedback from the public regarding operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Today, I will do three things. First, I will discuss briefly my outlook for the U.S. economy. Second, I will offer my historical perspective on the discount window, starting in 1913 and ending in 2000. Finally, I will provide a few details about the request for information the Fed recently published.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will say more about the discount window when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide3.png" id="fig3">slide 3</a>, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. A shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide4.png" id="fig4">slide 4</a>, the unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide5.png" id="fig5">slide 5</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p><strong>Discount Window History</strong><br /><em>1913: The Fed was established</em><br />Now, I will turn to my perspective on the history of the discount window. Understanding this history is important as we consider ways to ensure the discount window continues to serve effectively in its critical role of providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve.</p>
<p>Before the Federal Reserve was founded, the U.S. experienced frequent financial panics. One example is illustrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide6.png" id="fig6">slide 6</a>&nbsp;with a newspaper clipping from the Rocky Mountain Times printed on July 19, 1893. It depicts panic swirling against banks at a time when bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. The illustration shows how waves of panic hit public confidence, the rocks in the picture, and how banks have a fortress mentality. They stand strong against the panic, but they are not lending, and they are isolated.</p>
<p>Back then, the supply of money to the economy was inelastic in the short term, in part because the monetary system in the U.S. was based on the gold standard. Demand for cash, however, varied over the course of the year and was particularly strong during harvest season, when crops were brought to the market. The surge in demand for cash, combined with the inelastic supply of money in the short term, caused financial conditions to tighten seasonally. The banking system was fairly good at moving money to where it needed to go, but it had little scope to expand the total amount of money available in response to the U.S. economy's needs. So if a shock hit the economy when financial conditions were already tight, then the banking system struggled to provide the extra liquidity needed. Banks would seek to preserve liquidity by reducing their investments and denying loan requests, for example. Depositors, fearful that they might not be able to access their funds when they needed them, would rush to withdraw their money. Of course, that caused the banks to conserve further on liquidity. In some cases, they simply closed their doors until the storm passed. When banks closed their doors, economic activity would contract.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Activity would recover when the banks reopened, but the economic suffering in the meantime was meaningful.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply of money in the economy being inelastic in the short term, two prominent frictions, asymmetric information and externalities, made banks and private markets vulnerable to systemic crises. Here, asymmetric information refers to the fact that customers do not have access to all the information they need to evaluate whether a bank is insolvent, illiquid, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, customers rely on imperfect signals, such as news reports about another bank failing, to decide whether to withdraw their money from their own bank.</p>
<p>Then there are externalities, in the sense that an individual bank may not consider how an innocent bystander may be negatively impacted by its actions. When a financial institution fails, that may lead depositors to withdraw money from other unrelated banks, which may in turn cause those banks to fail. Contagion can transform a single bank failure into a systemic crisis, where many banks fail, credit evaporates, the stock market collapses, the economy enters a recession, and the unemployment rate increases dramatically.</p>
<p>The severe financial panic of 1907 stands out as an example of market failure due to these two prominent frictions. The panic was triggered by a series of bad banking decisions that led to a frenzy of withdrawals caused by asymmetric information and public distrust in the liquidity of the banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Banks in many large cities, including financial centers such as New York and Chicago, simply stopped sending payments outside of their communities. The resulting disruption in the payment system and to the flow of liquidity through the banking system led to a severe, though short-lived, economic contraction. This experience led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This act created the Federal Reserve System, composed of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In 1913, the main monetary policy tool at the Fed's disposal was the discount window. At that time, the Fed did not use open market operations&mdash;the buying and selling of government securities in the open market&mdash;to conduct monetary policy. Instead, the Fed adjusted the money supply by lending directly to banks that needed funds through the discount window. The Fed's ability to provide funds to banks as needed made the money supply of the U.S. more elastic and considerably reduced the seasonal volatility in interest rates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This ability also enabled the Fed to provide stability in times of stress, helping banks that experienced rapid withdrawals to satisfy their customers' demand for liquidity and thereby potentially preventing banking panics.</p>
<p><em>1920s: The Fed began to discourage strongly use of the discount window</em><br />In fact, many researchers have argued that the existence of the Fed's discount window prevented a financial crisis in the early 1920s, when the banking sector came under pressure as the U.S. economy transitioned to a peacetime economy following the end of World War I.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;There had been an agricultural boom during the war and a significant accumulation of debt within that sector. Farmers came under pressure as the prices of agricultural goods dropped from wartime highs. The banks sought to support their customers, and the Fed sought to support the banks. There were serious concerns about the condition of several banks in parts of the country. The Fed's discount window lending provided critical support that saved many banks but also resulted in habitual use of the discount window by some banks during the 1920s.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide7.png" id="fig7">Slide 7</a>&nbsp;shows that as of August 1925, 593 member banks, 6 percent of the total, had been borrowing for a year or more from Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, there were real solvency problems, and several banks failed with discount window loans outstanding. These challenges resulted in the Fed strongly discouraging banks from continuous borrowing from the discount window and the adoption of a policy of encouraging a "reluctance to borrow."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>By 1926, the Fed was explicit that borrowing at the discount window was meant to be short term. As I emphasize in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide8.png" id="fig8">slide 8</a>, the Federal Reserve's annual report for 1926 stated that while continuous borrowing by a member bank may be necessary, depending on local economic conditions, "the funds of the Federal reserve banks are primarily intended to be used in meeting the seasonal and temporary requirements of members, and continuous borrowing by a member bank as a general practice would not be consistent with the intent of the Federal reserve act."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>The late 1920s also highlighted Fed concerns about the purpose of the borrowing. The Fed sought to distinguish between "speculative security loans" and loans for "legitimate business."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;A staff reappraisal of the discount mechanism stated that "[t]he controversy over direct pressure intensified in the latter part of the 1920s as an increasing flow of bank credit went into the stock market."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;In short, the Fed observed that some banks were becoming habitual borrowers from the discount window. It was concerned that an overreliance on discount window borrowings would weaken banks and make them more prone to failure.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, the Fed switched to open market operations as its primary tool for conducting monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That allowed the Fed to determine the aggregate amount of liquidity in the system and to rely on private financial markets to distribute it efficiently. The discount window would thus serve as a safety valve if there was a shock that caused conditions to tighten unexpectedly or if individual banks experienced idiosyncratic shocks or somehow lost access to interbank markets.</p>
<p>The intention of this set-up was for banks to use the discount window to borrow from the Fed only occasionally. Ordinarily and predominantly, financial institutions were supposed to rely on private markets for their funding. This set-up was designed to limit moral hazard&mdash;the possibility that institutions take unnecessary risks when there is no market discipline. This is the key balancing act. The Fed needs to be a reliable backstop to prevent financial crises, but it also needs to minimize moral hazard that comes from always standing ready to provide support.</p>
<p><em>1930s&ndash;1940s: The Great Depression and WWII</em><br />During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the banking system experienced severe stress, including many bank runs. There are many reasons why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems in the banking system in the 1930s. I will highlight only two. First, many banks were insolvent rather than illiquid. Central bank lending is not a fundamental solution in those circumstances. When banks are insolvent, it is important to manage the closure in as orderly a manner as possible. The establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 gave bank regulators increased ability to do that. Relatedly, the challenging experiences of lending to troubled banks in the 1920s likely made the Fed more reluctant to lend in circumstances in which solvency concerns were material. Second, the types of collateral that the Fed was initially able to accept when lending to banks were quite limited.</p>
<p>In response, in the early 1930s Congress expanded the range of banking assets that could serve as collateral for discount window loans and added a variety of new Fed emergency lending authorities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;These new lending authorities were used in the 1930s to help alleviate distress. Some were also used in the early 1940s as the Fed helped support the World War II mobilization effort.</p>
<p>The period following the war was relatively calm. The role of the discount window shifted from addressing distress in the banking system to acting as a safety valve to manage tightness in money markets and support monetary policy operations.</p>
<p><em>1950&ndash;2000: Measures to discourage discount window borrowing</em><br />In March 1951, the U.S. Treasury and the Fed reached an agreement to separate government debt management from the conduct of monetary policy, thereby laying the foundation for the modern Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s, the Fed set the interest rate on discount window loans above market rates. Thus, it served as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate. The Fed continued to discourage extensive use of the discount window, but the relatively high interest rate also made its sustained use less attractive.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the Fed placed greater emphasis on open market operations to set its monetary policy stance. Concurrently, the Fed shifted to a policy of setting the interest rate on discount window loans below the market rates. Because the interest rate no longer deterred use of the window, the Fed turned increasingly to other measures, such as administrative pressures and moral suasion, to limit the frequency with which banks requested loans from the discount window. Indeed, between the late 1920s and the 1980s, the Fed adopted and amended numerous restrictions on discount window borrowing. Whenever discount window usage increased too much, the Fed tightened the restrictions to suppress borrowing.</p>
<p>For example, in the 1950s, the Fed defined appropriate and inappropriate discount window borrowing. In particular, the Board's regulations in 1955 stated that "[u]nder ordinary conditions, the continuous use of Federal Reserve credit by a member bank over a considerable period of time is not regarded as appropriate" and provided more details on how Reserve Banks should evaluate the "purpose" of a credit request.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;By 1973, the Board had made additional changes to its regulations on discount window use and defined three distinct discount window programs: adjustment credit, intended to help depository institutions meet short-term liquidity needs; seasonal credit, intended to help small depository institutions manage liquidity needs that arise from seasonal swings in loans and deposits; and extended credit, intended to help depository institutions that have somewhat longer-term liquidity needs resulting from exceptional circumstances.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Over time, the Board added provisions in its regulations requiring banks to exhaust other sources of funding before using discount window credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in the early 1980s, the Fed levied a surcharge on frequent borrowings by large banks to augment the administrative restrictions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Despite these policies to discourage use of the discount window,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide9.png" id="fig9">slide 9</a>&nbsp;shows that discount window borrowing, adjusted for the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, was notable in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting that the discount window was an important marginal source of funding for banks during that period.</p>
<p>That changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when there were notable solvency problems in the banking industry. During this period, the discount window provided support to troubled institutions, while the FDIC sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the failure of these institutions in an orderly manner. The discount window activity that took place while FDIC resolutions proceeded increased the association between use of the discount window and being a troubled institution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;As a result, banks became more reluctant to borrow from the discount window. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective, both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool. That resulted in a series of efforts by the Fed in the early 2000s to change how the discount window operates. Tomorrow, I will discuss those efforts when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><em>A request for information</em><br />Before closing, I'd like to return to where I began. Understanding the history of the discount window is important as we consider ways to ensure it continues to serve effectively in its critical role in providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve. One way to ensure it continues to serve effectively is to collect feedback from the public.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide10.png" id="fig10">Slide 10</a>&nbsp;provides some touch points on the Board's request for information document. The request for information seeks feedback from the public on a range of operational practices for the discount window and intraday credit, including the collection of legal documents; the process for pledging and withdrawing collateral; the process for requesting, receiving and repaying discount window advances; the extension of intraday credit; and Reserve Bank communications practices. My colleagues and I are looking forward to this feedback to inform potential future enhancements to discount window operations. The period for responding to our request for information ends on December 9, 2024.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The discount window is a monetary policy facility where depository institutions can request to borrow money against collateral from the Fed. The term "window" originates with the now obsolete practice of sending a bank representative to a Reserve Bank physical teller window when a bank needed to borrow money. The term "discount" refers to how depository institutions borrow money on a discount basis&mdash;interest amount for the entire loan period (plus other charges, if any) is deducted from the principal at the time a loan is disbursed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The Federal Reserve provides intraday credit to depository institutions to foster a safe and efficient payment system. For more information on intraday credit and the Board's Payment System Risk policy, see "Payment System Risk" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Illiquidity is a short-term cash flow problem. An illiquid bank cannot pay its current obligations, such as deposit withdrawals, even though the value of the bank's assets exceeds the value of its liabilities. In other words, illiquidity means the bank does not currently have the resources to meet its current obligations. With a short-term loan, an illiquid bank would be able to pay its obligations. Insolvency is a long-term balance sheet problem. Total obligations of an insolvent bank are larger than its total assets. A short-term loan would not help an insolvent bank. Of course, evaluating the quality of a bank's loan book in real time to determine whether a bank is solvent can be extremely challenging during a crisis. In addition, in some cases, illiquidity caused by large deposit withdrawals can lead banks to sell assets at fire-sale prices that then impairs their solvency. Conversely, concerns about insolvency, even if unfounded, can lead to liquidity problems. In the bank run literature, the connections between liquidity and solvency are a key factor that gives rise to runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The panic of 1907 started in October 1907 when three brothers&mdash;F. Augustus Heinze, Otto Heinze, and Arthur P. Heinze&mdash;as well as Charles W. Morse attempted to manipulate the price of United Copper stock by purchasing a large number of shares of the company. Their plan failed, and the stock price of United Copper collapsed. The collapse led to depositor runs on banks and trust companies associated with the Heinzes and Morse. This included a run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose president was connected to Morse. The Knickerbocker Trust Company failed, and the New York Stock Exchange fell nearly 50 percent from its peak of the previous year in the wake of the failure. See Terrell (2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. To aid its thinking on reforming the monetary system, Congress established the National Monetary Commission. The landmark 24 volume report from the commission provides a rich review of the operations of central banks in other countries, a history of financial crises in the U.S., and an appraisal of the state of the contemporary banking system in the U.S. at the time.&nbsp;</p>

In 1926, approximately one-third of all banks in the U.S. were member banks, holding about 60 percent of the total loans and investments for all banks; see Board of Governors (1926). Banks receiving charters from the federal government were required to become members of the Federal Reserve System while banks receiving charters from state governments had the option to become members. Discount window borrowing was originally limited to Federal Reserve System member banks. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 opened the window to all depository institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. See Gorton and Metrick (2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. See Anderson (1971, p. 137). In the statement, "direct pressure" refers to the Fed policy of pressuring banks not to borrow from the window. Congress may have shared some of those concerns, as the Federal Reserve Act was amended in 1933 to include a passage in section 4 requiring Reserve Banks to be careful about speculative uses of the Federal Reserve credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. Open market operations are the purchase or sale of securities (for example, U.S. Treasury bonds) in the open market by the Fed. In modern times, the short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the FOMC. For more information, please refer to "Open Market Operations" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. There are several banking acts that do this, but especially the Banking Act of 1932, the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, and the Banking Act of 1935. Yet one more reason why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems of the banking system in the 1930s is that, during this period, nonmember banks did not have access to the discount window. These banks suffered the most during the Great Depression. The ability of nonmember banks to access the window only changed in 1980 with the Monetary Control Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. After the U.S. entered World War II, the Federal Reserve supported efforts by the Treasury to hold down the cost of financing the war by establishing caps on interest rates on Treasury securities (see, for instance, Meltzer, 2003, Chapter 7). The cap pertaining to longer-term interest rates continued to be in place until the 1951 agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn19"></a>19. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr020/fr020008/fr020008.pdf">Advances and Discounts by Federal Reserve Banks, 20 Fed. Reg. 261, 263 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(Jan. 12, 1955).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr038/fr038068/fr038068.pdf">Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 38 Fed. Reg. 9065, 9076-9077 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(April 10, 1973).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. By 1980, the Board's regulations stated that adjustment credit "generally is available only after reasonable alternative sources of funds, including credit from special industry lenders, such as Federal Home Loan Banks, the National Credit Union Administration's Central Liquidity Facility, and corporate central credit unions have been fully used"; seasonal credit was "available only if similar assistance is not available from other special industry lenders"; and other extended credit was available only "where similar assistance is not reasonably available from other sources, including special industry lenders"; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr045/fr045159/fr045159.pdf">Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 45 Fed. Reg. 54009, 54009-54011 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(Aug. 14, 1980). See also Clouse (1994).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. See Meulendyke (1992).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. A congressional inquiry found that this lending likely increased losses to the deposit insurance funds at the time and led to limitations on the ability of the Federal Reserve to provide loans to troubled depository institutions as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group (RCG) for the Americas met on 7 and 8 October in Santiago. The meeting was hosted by the Central Bank of Chile and the Financial Market Commission. FSB Chair, Klaas Knot, joined RCG members for the meeting.</p>
<p>On the first day, members took part in a workshop on macroprudential frameworks and discussed the interaction between micro and macroprudential policies and the institutional arrangements needed for their consistent and effective implementation. Members stressed the importance of coordination and collaboration between financial authorities to respond to financial risks in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>On the second day, members discussed recent developments and shared their thoughts on vulnerabilities they were monitoring in their jurisdictions, including heightened volatility and asset repricing risks. Members exchanged views on potential implications of recent monetary easing on capital flows and exchange rates in the region. Severe weather events have increased in frequency and intensity in the Americas. The group discussed the availability and affordability of climate and natural catastrophe insurance in the region, and implications for financial stability. Members discussed their work to strengthen the reliability and comparability of climate-related financial disclosures and to incorporate climate-related risks into their supervisory frameworks.</p>
<p>Digital innovation in payments has the potential to boost the provision of &ndash; and access to &ndash; finance in the region. Such innovation could help meet the goals of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/">G20&rsquo;s Roadmap</a>&nbsp;for cheaper, faster, more accessible and transparent cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. Members notably discussed issues and developments related to open finance, fast payment systems, central bank digital currencies and crypto-assets, and challenges in fostering digital innovation in payments. Members noted the importance of the FSB&rsquo;s work to promote greater alignment and interoperability in these frameworks within and across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Recent operational incidents, such as the CrowdStrike failure, illustrate the risks from financial institutions&rsquo; reliance on third-party providers. Members discussed their progress in implementing the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">toolkit</a>&nbsp;to help financial institutions to monitor, identify and manage risks arising from third-party services and work to strengthen their cyber resilience. Members acknowledged the FSB&rsquo;s efforts in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/recommendations-to-achieve-greater-convergence-in-cyber-incident-reporting-final-report/">promoting greater convergence in cyber incident reporting</a>&nbsp;and looked forward to participating in the upcoming consultation on a format for incident reporting exchange.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Americas is co-chaired by Kenneth Baker, Managing Director and CEO, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DSB, Technology Advisory Committee, OTC derivatives, application deadline, governance<br />
Summary:<br />
DSB's TAC welcomes new applicants for a two-year term. It provides technical stewardship, advises on industry consultation topics, and shapes DSB's technology roadmap. <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today announced that the DSB&rsquo;s Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter is&nbsp;</span><span>welcoming new applicants&nbsp;</span><span>ahead of a new two (2) year term</span><span>, with an application deadline of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>23rd October.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Established in 2018, the TAC provides advisory support to the DSB in recognition of required enhancements and adaptations to its technology base and services. Working alongside the DSB Product and Governance Advisory Committees, the TAC is responsible for the technical stewardship ensuring the DSB technology strategy is aligned with the needs of the markets it serves, including making recommendations to the DSB Board&nbsp;</span>on technology-related DSB industry consultation topics.<br /><br />The TAC is composed of representatives from DSB user organisations, independent experts and regulatory observers within the wider OTC derivatives community and its remit includes matters relating to both the OTC International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) Services.&nbsp;The DSB invites applications from OTC-derivatives technology practitioners from across all jurisdictions and institutional types to contribute to DSB technical governance and development.</span></p>
<p><span>During previous charter terms, the TAC has focused on the DSB&rsquo;s resiliency, including the DSB&rsquo;s disaster recovery arrangements. A key development is the addition of a second &ldquo;as-production&rdquo; UAT environment, introduced to assist users with regression testing of their own IT changes against the DSB. The TAC has also launched specialist subcommittees with the Global Agile Architecture subcommittee having recently overseen the migration of&nbsp;<span>the DSB&rsquo;s infrastructure to&nbsp;</span><span>a globally distributed data repository covering multiple locations in Europe and North America.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Andy Hughes, a member of the DSB Management Team and DDO of the TAC,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;The collaboration with the TAC over the last charter term&nbsp;</span><span>which helped shape UPI implementation and its integration into the OTC ISIN Service</span><span>. This continued collaboration with the TAC members will be essential during this next charter term as the DSB expands into further global jurisdictional regions and adapts to changes in digital operations."<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB&nbsp;</strong>added<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The TAC is instrumental in shaping the DSB technology roadmap. The technical expertise of the TAC continues to play a key part in the evolution of our services. The work of the DSB industry representation groups is highly valued and designed to ensure that all developments continue to best serve industry requirements.&rdquo;</span></p>

Derivatives traded volume achieved single-day records over two consecutive days during the month, reaching as high as 3.46 million contracts across equities, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities on 25 September.</p>
<p>Key highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities unique to market-based finance explain why we delivered the most significant reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets in a generation.</li>
<li>Our review of the financial advice and guidance boundary aims to unlock innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs.</li>

<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether in London, in Brussels, Hong Kong or New York, the same discussion is underway: how do we maximise the ability of sustainable, vibrant capital markets to drive greater volumes of investment into the real economy?</p>
<p>That question &ndash; asked by policymakers and industry alike &ndash; is why we brought you all here today and I want to thank all the speakers who have made this conference such a success.</p>
<p>I know that many of you, like me, have had whole careers dedicated to capital markets during an era where globalisation drove a remarkable surge of cross-border investment flows. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I started my career as one of a vast number of very junior lawyers who worked on the UK&rsquo;s gas, water, electricity and telecoms privatisations of the '80s, amid the huge changes brought about by the financial services 'big bang'.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in the astounding development of China&rsquo;s international equity and bond markets. And not long ago I led the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global regulatory standard setter for securities markets.</p>
<p>I have seen first-hand how capital markets can work well. How they can drive business &ndash; with factories built, shops opened, goods delivered, people employed; how they can support long-term risk taking to deliver more secure retirements for millions of people; and how they can spur wider economic growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen how market fragmentation and de-globalisation can stall cross-border capital formation.</p>
<p>But it's the opportunities that are unique to market-based finance which explain why the FCA has just delivered the most significant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-overhauls-listing-rules-boost-growth-and-innovation-uk-stock-markets" title="FCA overhauls listing rules to boost growth and innovation on UK stock markets">reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets</a>&nbsp;in a generation.</p>
<p>These reforms are already having an impact, ensuring that more businesses can get into the shop window. But the harder task is to more effectively mobilise the domestic savings necessary to grow these businesses.</p>
<p>When we talk about listings regimes, stamp duty, accounting rules, or even initial public offerings (IPO&rsquo;s), those outside this room could be forgiven for thinking we&rsquo;re speaking in a foreign language, switching off as a result, unsure how any of it matters to them.</p>
<p>So, we need to make a case for it to matter to a far wider section of the population. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wider inclusion</h2>
<p>In the US, stock market performance routinely features in political debate and retail participation is the norm. Total equity market capitalisation is around 55 trillion dollars, or 200% of GDP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, three quarters of corporate financing in the EU is bank lending and, as we have heard, efforts to promote a capital markets union recognise the implications of this for the real economy.</p>
<p>UK market capitalisation stands at around 3.2 trillion dollars, or 100% of GDP. But since the heady days of the 1980s, structural and other factors have fostered a low-to-no risk culture, which if left unaddressed, has clear implications for our ability to finance future economic growth.</p>
<p>Back in Hong Kong, I saw a very different investment culture. One in which retail participation was far greater than here in the UK, and where people were much more aware of how the market works and the risks involved.</p>
<p>In the UK,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.newfinancial.org/reports/widening-retail-participation-in-equity-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the proportion of households<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;directly owning stocks and shares has halved in 2 decades. According to New Financial, just 4.4% of UK pension funds assets are held in domestic equities. That has a huge opportunity cost for capital hungry businesses, and for the wider economy.</p>
<p>It creates a gap for individuals, too.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/09/the-uk-investment-gap--p430-billion-in-cash-savings-not-invested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barclays reports<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;that 13 million UK adults are missing out by holding &pound;430 billion in cash savings which could be put to more productive use. So, we are looking to address this.</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review</h2>
<p>Our Review with the Government of the boundary between regulated financial advice and guidance is incredibly technical. Unpicking the interplay between our own rules, domestic legislation and consolidated EU law is hard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But its aim is simple: unlocking innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs, in easy-to-access ways, at prices they can afford, so they have the confidence to make the most of their money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in doing this, we boost growth: for personal finances, for those seeking investment, and for the UK as a whole.</p>
<h2>Value for Money Framework</h2>
<p>This goal also underpins our Framework, developed jointly with Government and The Pensions Regulator, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/pensions-value-money" title="Pensions value for money">value for money</a>&nbsp;for workplace pension savers.</p>
<p>This seeks to ensure the &pound;130 billion a year saved into these schemes works harder for people. A focus on value rather than costs should help providers invest in assets that deliver greater long-term returns.</p>
<p>Through these and a raft of other initiatives, we are looking to shift our national view of risk.</p>
<p>Today has shown that many others around the world are grappling with similar issues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to continued collaboration with colleagues, both domestic and global, as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>ISDA: Derivatives, Margining And Risk In Emerging Market And Developing Economies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Derivatives have an important role to play in the development of economies and financial markets in emerging jurisdictions. Financial regulation, in turn, is a critical element in shaping the safe, efficient use and growth of risk management activity in these countries. One of the most important elements of the financial regulatory framework for derivatives is margining: the exchange of collateral, or margin, for derivatives transactions. This paper explains what margining is, how it works and the key issues for policymakers in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) to consider when transposing margin-related regulation to their jurisdictions, with a particular focus on non-cleared derivatives.</p>

<title>CanDeal Data &amp; Analytics (DNA) To Distribute Consensus Canadian OIS And Swap Rates Via LSEG</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/candeal-data-and-analytics-dna-to-distribute-consensus-canadian-ois-and-swap-rat/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CanDeal DNA, the premier source for Canadian OTC fixed income and derivatives pricing, is partnering with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to distribute CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates are expected to become key reference rates for the market due to quality and consistency of coverage with inputs provided by, and consensus derived from, CanDeal&rsquo;s partner banks and dealers.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA works closely with industry stakeholders to provide data and solutions to support the Canadian market and global market participants. This product innovation is an extension of CanDeal&rsquo;s collaborative efforts with the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) as the market transitions away from CDOR to the new Term CORRA benchmark. CanDeal DNA publishes statistics and analysis resulting from the transition to Term CORRA in our CanDeal Observations bulletin available at <a href="http://candeal.com/" title="candeal.com">candeal.com</a>.</p>
<p>The CanDeal Consensus CAD OIS (CORRA) Rates product is designed to provide market transparency in the OIS swap curve for out to two years, while the CanDeal Consensus CAD Swap (CORRA) Rates product provides rates from two to 30 years. Each rate represents the market rate for the fixed leg of a swap where the floating leg references the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA).</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates will be available via LSEG Data &amp; Analytics under a global free-trial period until January 1, 2025. Thereafter, the products will become fee liable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal is the premier service for Canadian fixed income and interest rate derivatives data. This extension of our partnership will enable our clients to derive additional value through access to the Consensus OIS and Swap Rates,&rdquo; said Debbie Lawrence, Group Head of Data Strategy and Management at LSEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cessation of the CDOR benchmark has been a turning point for the financial industry,&rdquo; said Andre Craig, President of CanDeal DNA, a division of CanDeal Group, a leading provider of an electronic marketplace and data services for Canadian dollar debt securities and derivatives. &ldquo;In addition to collaborating with CanDeal Benchmark Solutions and market stakeholders to launch the forward-looking Term CORRA benchmark this past year, we are honored to continue to partner with the industry and with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to introduce the Consensus OIS and Swap Curves and provide deeper transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside their award-winning Reference Pricing Service, CanDeal DNA provides intraday and real-time pricing for Canadian fixed income securities, advanced and regulatory analytics, security master, and curves solutions.</p>

<title>ICE Introduces Multi-Asset Class Climate Transition Risk Solution - Holistic Emissions Data Now Available For Municipal Bonds, Mortgage-Backed Securities And Real Estate, As Well As Corporate And Sovereign Bonds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of a multi-asset class climate transition risk solution, which provides emissions estimates and portfolio analytics across various fixed income asset classes, covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and real estate. This new solution, combined with ICE&rsquo;s existing coverage of sovereign, corporate equity, and private companies, can enable clients to assess and benchmark their financed emissions across a comprehensive range of fixed income asset classes in one integrated offering.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s new multi-asset class transition risk solution addresses gaps in emissions data by covering underserved sub-asset classes, such as RMBS, CMBS, and private corporates. By integrating this data, ICE can provide a unified portfolio metric that tracks financed emissions across multiple asset classes, supporting climate risk reporting, ensuring a holistic portfolio coverage from a physical and transition risk standpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our clients increasingly need quality transition risk data for underserved segments, particularly mortgage-backed securities, where we have applied physics-based simulations with building energy models and ICE&rsquo;s data to provide emissions insights for RMBS and CMBS,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Head of ICE Climate. &ldquo;Mortgages and mortgage securities can represent more than 20 percent of bank balance sheets, leading to a growing need for data to help meet regulatory disclosure and support stress testing to inform decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s multi-asset class transition risk solution provides PCAF-aligned (<a href="https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/about" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials</a>) financed emissions data, encompassing over 110 million US properties and more than 4.2 million fixed income securities globally. With this solution, clients can leverage advanced portfolio analytics to evaluate total emissions across multi-asset class portfolios, assisting clients in transition risk strategies. ICE&rsquo;s methodologies, customized for each asset class, provide comprehensive emissions tracking, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 estimates, as well as carbon intensity metrics, essential to meet climate regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>This new solution is part of the company&rsquo;s climate data offering, which provides data and analytics that help quantify investment impacts posed by transition risks as well as physical climate risks, such as extreme weather events.</p>
