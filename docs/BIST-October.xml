<br>
HKEX achieved strong third-quarter results with record volumes in all markets, successful IPO listings, and strategic enhancements for future growth.
<br><br>Summary: <div>
<p>Bonnie Y Chan, Chief Executive Officer said: &ldquo;HKEX had a strong third quarter, achieving its second-best ever nine-month revenue and profit. The vibrancy and diversity of Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets were on full display in late September, as investor sentiment turned more favourable following the announcement of economic stimulus measures in Mainland China, as well as the monetary easing policies adopted by major central banks. This drove strong volumes in all our markets, with multiple daily records achieved across the Cash, Derivatives, ETP and Northbound and Southbound Stock Connect markets. Furthermore, the Commodities market extended its robust performance in the third quarter, reporting a 25 per cent year-on-year gain in LME chargeable average daily volumes during the nine-month period, contributing to the strength in the Group&rsquo;s results during this period.</p>
<p>The recent listing on the Exchange of Asia&rsquo;s largest and the world&rsquo;s second-biggest IPO this year, along with the strength of follow-on offering volumes, underscore the depth and attractiveness of our markets, whilst a healthy listing pipeline reinforces our position as the region&rsquo;s IPO fundraising centre of choice. Moreover, Alibaba&rsquo;s conversion to a dual primary listing, and its subsequent inclusion in Stock Connect, highlights how such a structure can help companies effectively tap into Mainland China&rsquo;s capital pool and enhance liquidity.</p>
<p>As part of our strategic efforts, HKEX successfully implemented Severe Weather Trading arrangements in the Securities and Derivatives Markets. This reinforces Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as the best-in-class international trading and risk management hub, aligning us with global standards. Additionally, we enhanced the Self-Match Prevention service in the Derivatives Market, and introduced Weekly Hang Seng TECH Index Options.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to further enhancing the vibrancy, resilience, and competitiveness of our markets. By continuously expanding our product offerings, forging international partnerships, and investing in our infrastructure, we are well positioned to navigate the evolving macro-environment and propel sustained growth. We look forward to working closely in partnership with our stakeholders in Hong Kong, and around the world, to ensure that our markets remain fit for purpose for the next generation of investors."</p>

<div> October 18, People's Bank of China, SSE companies, re-lending loans, share repurchase, shareholding increase
Summary:<br><br>People's Bank of China collaborates to issue re-lending loans for share repurchase and shareholding increase, providing robust financial support for SSE companies. <div>
<p>On October 18, People's Bank of China, in collaboration with National Financial Regulatory Administration and China Securities Regulatory Commission, issued the&nbsp;<span>Notice on Matters Related to the Establishment of Re-lending Loans for Share Repurchase and Shareholding Increase.</span>&nbsp;The initial re-lending will be RMB 300 billion at an interest rate of 1.75 percent and a maturity of one year, which can be extended as appropriate. According to the Securities Times, following the new policy, 13 SSE companies applied for the first batch of loans and issued relevant announcements during weekend. Among them, 11 companies listed on the SSE Main Board secured a total of RMB 5.176 billion of relending loans for share repurchase and shareholding increase, including about RMB 2.330 billion dedicated to share repurchase and about RMB 2.846 billion for shareholding increase.</p>
<p>The relending loans launched this time offer robust financial support to SSE companies, enabling them to implement the share repurchase and shareholding increase plan at a lower interest rate. This is expected to significantly boost their enthusiasm for share repurchase and shareholding increase. On the evening of October 20, the four listed companies (COSCO SHIPPING Holdings Co., Ltd., COSCO SHIPPING Development Co., Ltd., COSCO SHIPPING Energy Transportation Co., Ltd., and COSCO SHIPPING Specialized Carriers Co., Ltd.) under China COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited collectively issued an announcement for share repurchase and shareholding increase.</p>
<p>The newly launched policy has also provided more funding sources for companies that have previously disclosed their plans to buy back shares and boost shareholdings. Listed companies, including China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corporation, China Merchants Energy Shipping Co., Ltd., GigaDevice Semiconductor (Beijing) Inc., Zhejiang Jiahua Energy Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Sinotrans Limited, and Shandong Linglong Tyre Co., Ltd., have issued announcements to expand their funding sources.</p>

<div> DIMS, New Zealand, FMA, monitoring, investment<br>
Summary:<br>
Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko published its first DIMS sector monitoring report. It identified areas for improvement in processes and controls. FMA will hold a webinar to discuss the report. <div>
<p>Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; today published its first monitoring report of the Discretionary Investment Management Services (DIMS) sector. The report found that while DIMS providers strive for positive investor outcomes, there is room for improvement in their processes and controls.</p>
<p>DIMS is a large part of the wealth management sector in New Zealand. It involves investors giving their provider authority to use their discretion about buying and selling financial products on their behalf.</p>
<p>There are 49 active licensed DIMS providers in New Zealand. They collectively manage more than 47,000 retail accounts with funds under management of $48 billion. The average DIMS investor portfolio value as of June 2024 was approximately $1 million.</p>
<p>In 2022, the FMA surveyed DIMS providers to find out how their governance, policies, processes, systems, and controls were used to meet compliance obligations and mitigate the risk of investor harm. Following the survey, the FMA monitored nine licensed DIMS providers. Taking a risk-based approach, the monitoring reviews focused on five key areas, being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conflicts of interest</li>
<li>Investment management</li>
<li>Investment strategy</li>
<li>Investment performance monitoring &nbsp;</li>
<li>Fee disclosure and transparency.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report discusses the inherent risks in each of these areas, the good practice the FMA observed, and recommendations on where improvements can be made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, John Horner, said: &ldquo;We were generally pleased with what we observed. Where a client allows another person to exercise discretion over investment decisions, it demands a high degree of trust and confidence, both in the people involved, and the processes and controls used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our future monitoring will build on what we have learned and focus on the areas of improvement identified in this report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA will be holding a webinar with the sector to discuss the report in the coming weeks. To register interest, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:events@fma.govt.nz?subject=Webinar%20Event%3A%20FMA%20publishes%20first%20insights%20report%20into%20Discretionary%20Investment%20Management%20Services%20sector" title="Link to email address for enquiry">events@fma.govt.nz</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Statement Regarding Administrative Proceedings Against SolarWinds Customers, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda/ Oct. 22, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>According to the Government Accountability Office, the 2019-2020 cyberattacks against SolarWinds Corporation (&ldquo;SolarWinds&rdquo;) and its Orion software were &ldquo;one of the most widespread and sophisticated hacking campaigns ever conducted against the federal government and the private sector.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It was an attack against America.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;How has the Commission responded? By first charging SolarWinds in district court<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and, in today&rsquo;s settled proceedings,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;charging four customers of its Orion software, with violations of the federal securities laws. Today&rsquo;s proceedings impose nearly $7 million in penalties against these victims of the cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The four proceedings can be divided into two categories. Two of the companies &ndash; Avaya Holdings Corp. (&ldquo;Avaya&rdquo;) and Mimecast Limited (&ldquo;Mimecast&rdquo;) &ndash; disclosed information about the cyberattack.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;However, the Commission finds that the disclosures omitted certain material information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The other two companies &ndash; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (&ldquo;Check Point&rdquo;) and Unisys Corporation (&ldquo;Unisys&rdquo;) &ndash; did not update an existing risk factor in response to the cyberattack.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The Commission finds that those risk factors became materially misleading without disclosure that the Orion software in the companies&rsquo; respective network had been compromised.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The common theme across the four proceedings is the Commission playing Monday morning quarterback. Rather than focusing on whether the companies&rsquo; disclosure provided material information to investors, the Commission engages in a hindsight review to second-guess the disclosure and cites immaterial, undisclosed details to support its charges. Accordingly, we dissent.</p>
<p>Avaya and Mimecast</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avaya</span></i></p>
<p>With respect to Avaya, the Commission highlights &ldquo;the likely attribution of the [cyberattack] to a nation-state threat actor&rdquo; as an example of omitted material information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s view that such information is material is troubling for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, in its 2023 rulemaking on cybersecurity incident disclosure (the &ldquo;2023 Cybersecurity Rule&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;neither investors nor the Commission expressed a view that the identity of the threat actor is material information. When proposing the 2023 Cybersecurity Rule, the Commission sought public feedback on whether there were specific types of information that should be disclosed for a material cybersecurity incident.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Not a single one of the 150-plus comment letters submitted on the proposal requested disclosure of the identity of the threat actor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that investors consider this information to be material. When adopting the 2023 Cybersecurity Rule, the Commission stated that disclosure of cybersecurity incidents should &ldquo;focus&hellip;primarily on the impacts of&hellip;[the]&hellip;incident, rather than on&hellip;details regarding the incident itself.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The identity of the threat actor, while an obvious &ldquo;detail&hellip;regarding the incident,&rdquo; lacks a clear link to the &ldquo;impact&rdquo; of the incident. By using a settled proceeding to convey the view that this information is material, the Commission regulates by enforcement.</p>
<p>Second, by the time Avaya disclosed information about the cyberattack in February 2021, there had already been widespread media reports<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and a joint statement by government agencies<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;that Russia was the likely threat actor. Although Avaya&rsquo;s disclosure did not tie its incident to the SolarWinds cyberattack, it is unlikely that attribution of the incident to Russia would have &ldquo;significantly altered the &lsquo;total mix&rsquo; of information&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;about Avaya to a reasonable investor in light of the existing public information about the cyberattack.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s other factors for why Avaya omitted material information are equally unconvincing. The Commission cites &ldquo;the long-term unmonitored presence of the threat actor in Avaya&rsquo;s systems, the access to at least 145 shared files some of which contained confidential and/or proprietary information, and the fact that the mailbox the threat actor accessed belong to one of Avaya&rsquo;s cybersecurity personnel.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;These are the &ldquo;details regarding the incident itself&rdquo; &ndash; as opposed to the &ldquo;impact&rdquo; of incident &ndash; that the Commission has said do not need to be disclosed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mimecast</span></i></p>
<p>Although the Form 8-K requirements for disclosing material cybersecurity incidents, which were adopted as part of the 2023 Cybersecurity Rule, did not yet apply to Mimecast, it filed three Form 8-Ks related to the intrusion of the Orion software on its network.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;In the third Form 8-K, Mimecast filed its three-page incident report for the cyberattack as an exhibit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Mimecast&rsquo;s efforts to inform its investors would not be rewarded; the Commission finds fault with its disclosures, particularly regarding &ldquo;the large number of impacted customers and the percentage of code exfiltrated by the threat actor.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The Commission highlights Mimecast&rsquo;s failure to disclose that &ldquo;the threat actor had accessed a database containing encrypted credentials for approximately 31,000 [of 40,000] customers.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Where the compromised information consists of a large percentage of customer credentials, disclosure of such fact&nbsp;<i>can be</i>&nbsp;material. In assessing materiality in the Commission&rsquo;s case against SolarWinds, the court stated that &ldquo;perspective and context are critical&rdquo; to evaluating whether a Form 8-K is materially misleading and that a filing is not misleading if &ldquo;[the] disclosure, read as a whole, captured the big picture.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Mimecast disclosed, without providing a percentage or number, that encrypted customer credentials had been accessed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;It said that the company was &ldquo;resetting the affected&hellip;credentials.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Mimecast further disclosed that it found &ldquo;no evidence that the threat actor accessed email or archive content held by [it] on behalf of [its] customers.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn26">[26]</a></p>
<p>In bringing charges against Mimecast, the Commission focuses on the detail of the threat actor accessing a database containing customer credentials, as opposed to the larger picture of the effects of the incident. Access to credentials, by itself, may not be material if the threat actor does not use the credentials to misappropriate customer information. Mimecast&rsquo;s disclosure, read as a whole, conveys the complete story about the unauthorized access of credentials and the lack of misappropriated information.</p>
<p>With respect to disclosure of exfiltrated source code, Mimecast stated in its incident report that the threat actor had downloaded a &ldquo;limited number&rdquo; of its source code repositories but the company believed that the downloaded code was &ldquo;incomplete and would be insufficient to build and run any aspect of the Mimecast service.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;The Commission finds that these statements were materially misleading because Mimecast did not disclose that the threat actor had exfiltrated &ldquo;58% of its exgestion source code, 50% of its M365 authentication source code, and 76% of its M365 interoperability source code, representing the majority of the source code for those three areas.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn28">[28]</a></p>
<p>By calling for disclosure of specific percentages and types of source code, the Commission ignores the&nbsp;<i>reasonable</i>&nbsp;investor standard embedded within the materiality concept and the types of information that such investor would consider important in making an investment decision. We are doubtful that a reasonable investor would understand how exfiltration of such precise percentages of those three types of source code affects Mimecast. Similar to the Avaya case, such information is &ldquo;details regarding the incident itself&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn29">[29]</a>&nbsp;that do not need to be disclosed. For us, the material disclosure by Mimecast is that the cyberattack did not result in modifications of the company&rsquo;s source code or have effects on its products.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn30">[30]</a>&nbsp;Notably, the Commission did not find that such statement was materially misleading.</p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effect on Form 8-K, Item 1.05 Disclosure</span></i></p>
<p>In addition to our concerns about the charges against Avaya and Mimecast, we are also concerned about how the proceedings against them will shape disclosure provided pursuant to new Item 1.05 of Form 8-K, which was adopted as part of the 2023 Cybersecurity Rule. This item requires companies to disclose &ldquo;the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing&rdquo; of a material cybersecurity incident.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Companies reviewing today&rsquo;s proceedings<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn32">[32]</a>&nbsp;reasonably could conclude that the Commission will evaluate their Item 1.05 disclosure with a hunger for details that runs contrary to statements in the adopting release.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn33">[33]</a>&nbsp;To avoid being second-guessed by the Commission, companies may fill their Item 1.05 disclosures with immaterial details about an incident, or worse, provide disclosure under the item about immaterial incidents. The Commission staff has already identified the latter practice as an issue,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn34">[34]</a>&nbsp;and today&rsquo;s proceedings may exacerbate the problem. As the Commission recognized when adopting the 2023 Cybersecurity Rule, immaterial disclosure about cybersecurity incidents may &ldquo;divert investor attention&rdquo; and result in &ldquo;mispricing of securities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn35">[35]</a>&nbsp;However, if the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement actions have the practical effect of requiring immaterial disclosure, then the benefits and underlying rationale used to support the 2023 Cybersecurity Rule may be undermined.</p>
<p>Check Point and Unisys</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s proceedings against Check Point and Unisys both rest on a similar theory: the company failed to update its cybersecurity risk factor for the Orion software compromise and left its risk factor generic (in the case of Check Point)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn36">[36]</a>&nbsp;or as a hypothetical (in the case of Unisys).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn37">[37]</a></p>
<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check Point</span></i></p>
<p>In the SolarWinds case, the Commission argued that the SolarWinds risk factor was &ldquo;unacceptably boilerplate and generic&rdquo; because of &ldquo;the company&rsquo;s internal recognition that its security systems were faulty.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn38">[38]</a>&nbsp;The court rejected the argument after a detailed review of SolarWinds&rsquo; risk disclosure and concluded that &ldquo;[v]iewed in totality, [such] disclosure was sufficient to alert the investing public of the types and nature of cybersecurity risks SolarWinds faced and the grave consequences these could present for the company&rsquo;s financial health and future.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn39">[39]</a></p>
<p>In its proceeding against Check Point, the Commission argues that the company&rsquo;s risk disclosure was generic and should have been revised because its cybersecurity risk profile had materially changed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn40">[40]</a>&nbsp;This contention, however, merits cautious consideration in light of the SolarWinds court&rsquo;s reasoning in dismissing portions of the Commission&rsquo;s case against SolarWinds, which, as illustrated below, was based on arguably similar disclosures.</p>

<p><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unisys</span></i></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s case against Unisys<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn44">[44]</a>&nbsp;rests on the finding that Unisys&rsquo;s risk factor framed cybersecurity events as hypothetical, even though a compromise of the Orion software on the company&rsquo;s network already had occurred.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn45">[45]</a></p>
<p>Risk factors are designed to warn investors about events that&nbsp;<i>could</i>&nbsp;occur and materially affect the company. To the extent that an event&nbsp;<i>has</i>&nbsp;occurred and&nbsp;<i>has</i>&nbsp;materially affected the company, it is generally required to be disclosed in another part of a filing, such as the description of the business, management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis, or the financial statements and notes thereto. Whether risk factors need to be updated because certain hypothetical risks have materialized is not always a straightforward matter,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn46">[46]</a>&nbsp;and the Commission should be judicious in bringing charges in this area. If the Commission does not exercise restraint, it could find a violation in every company&rsquo;s risk disclosure because risk factors cover a wide range of topics and are inherently disclosure of hypothetical events. Aggressive enforcement by the Commission may cause companies to fill their risk disclosures with occurrences of immaterial events, for fear of being second-guessed by the Commission. Such a result would frustrate the Commission&rsquo;s goal of preventing a lengthy risk factor section filled with immaterial disclosure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn47">[47]</a></p>
<p>In light of these considerations, the case against Unisys is one that did not need to be brought. The Commission advances three reasons for why the company&rsquo;s cybersecurity risk profile changed materially and its risk factor should have been updated.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn48">[48]</a></p>
<p>First, the Commission states that a &ldquo;persistent and reportedly nation-state supported threat actor compromised the company&rsquo;s environment.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn49">[49]</a>&nbsp;This factor does not show materiality because it merely says that a cybersecurity incident occurred, and not every incident is material.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission finds that &ldquo;the threat actor persisted in the environment unmonitored for a combined span of at least sixteen months.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn50">[50]</a>&nbsp;While this fact is concerning from an information security perspective, the Commission fails to elaborate on why it is material from a securities law perspective. Notably, the Commission did not find that Unisys&rsquo;s financial results were adversely affected or its reputation had measurably declined, especially relative to its peers given the widespread nature of the SolarWinds cyberattack.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission says that &ldquo;[Unisys]&rsquo;s investigation of the activity suffered from gaps that prevented it from identifying the full scope of the compromise.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-uyeda-statement-solarwinds-102224#_ftn51">[51]</a>&nbsp;It is unclear to us how an after-the-fact investigation of a cybersecurity incident affects the materiality of the incident itself. The Commission did not find that the unidentified aspect of the compromise materially affected Unisys. Similar to the second reason, the Commission fails to explain how a subpar investigation relates to adverse effects on the company.</p>
<p>Because we are not persuaded by the Commission&rsquo;s arguments on the materiality of Unisys&rsquo;s cybersecurity incident, we do not support the charges against the company.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cybersecurity incidents are one of a myriad of issues that most companies face. The Commission needs to start treating companies subject to cyberattacks as victims of a crime, rather than perpetrators of one. Yes, the Commission must protect investors by ensuring that companies disclose material incidents, but donning a Monday morning quarterback&rsquo;s jersey to insist that immaterial information be disclosed &mdash; as the Commission did in today&rsquo;s four proceedings &mdash; does not protect investors. It does the opposite.</p>

The Commission also finds that Mimecast&rsquo;s disclosure was materially misleading because it failed to disclose that the threat actor accessed server and configuration information for approximately 17,000 customers. Mimecast Order at paragraph 14. Mimecast disclosed in its incident report that the threat actor accessed server information. Mimecast Incident Report at p.1 (&ldquo;[T]he threat actor accessed certain Mimecast-issued certificates and related customer server connection information.&rdquo;). The Commission fails to explain why the specific number of customers whose server and configuration information was accessed is material when the company had already disclosed that server information was accessed.</p>

Summary: 
- Net revenue, EBITDA, and net profit all showed strong growth in Q3/2024.
- The company raised its guidance for full year 2024 based on strong organic growth.
- Implementation of the Horizon 2026 strategy is on track, with confidence in reaching financial targets for 2026. <div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has just published its quarterly statement Q3/2024.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overview of results:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Our Group&rsquo;s net revenue rose by 18 per cent in the third quarter to &euro;1,403.9 million (Q3/2023: &euro;1,188.3 million).</li>
<li>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to &euro;801.8 million (Q3/2023: &euro;684.8 million), an increase of 17 per cent.</li>
<li>Net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG shareholders was &euro;444.9 million (Q3/2023: &euro;400.3 million). Earnings per share before purchase price allocation effects rose by 10 per cent to &euro;2.61 (Q3/2023: &euro;2.37).</li>
<li>In view of the strong organic growth in net revenue we are again raising our guidance for the full year 2024 and now expect net revenue of around &euro;5.8 billion. We now expect EBITDA to be within a range of &euro;3.3 to 3.4 billion.</li>
<li>We are fully on track with the implementation of the Horizon 2026 strategy and confirm our financial targets for the year 2026.</li>
<li>The share capital of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG was reduced by &euro;188,300,000.00 on 17 September 2024 when treasury shares were cancelled in accordance with the share buy-back programme.</li>
<li>Gregor Pottmeyer, CFO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG, commented on the results as follows: &ldquo;Our secular net revenue growth continued to develop positively in the third quarter, as expected. Even if the tailwinds from the phase of high interest rates are gradually slowing, we are looking at a very attractive core business with further significant growth potential. All the segments in our Group contributed to our success in the first nine months. Our expectations were exceeded, especially in the Commodities unit and for net interest income. We now&nbsp;assume that we will again exceed the revised guidance for the full year 2024 and expect net revenue of around &euro;5.8 billion, with EBITDA in a range of &euro;3.3 to 3.4 billion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Concerning the strategic outlook, Stephan Leithner, Co-CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG, said: &ldquo;We are right on track with the implementation of our Horizon 2026 strategy. The very good secular growth of our business units, together with the successful integration of SimCorp are clear signs of progress. We are working with great motivation and focus on implementing our strategy and are very confident of reaching our financial targets for 2026.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analyst and investor conference call will take place on Wednesday, 23 October, at 14:00 CEST.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Thankyou - it is a pleasure to be here. I am going to use my time to talk about global financial stability and the challenges we face today. But I am going to start with some theory. The reason is that there is an issue with financial stability in that the risks can take on a laundry list character, and a long list at that. This can leave a &lsquo;take your pick&rsquo; mindset, and a sense that this is all too much, or that it is not sufficiently grounded.</p>
<p>So, bear with me for a short travel into theory, and then I will seek to put today&rsquo;s big issues or at least some of them, into that context.</p>
<p>For me, the founding father of more developed financial stability theory was Hyman Minsky. His core argument was that money and finance matter together for understanding economies, and particularly for understanding susceptibility to stress, Unstable finance contributes to economic instability, and the institutional arrangements by which money and finance operate do matter. Capital and financial instruments are traded and have their prices determined in markets, and these are separate from, but linked to, the prices of current output in the economy. Financial practices change over time, and these changes can impact the behaviour of the economy. Economies can therefore oscillate between robust and fragile financial strictures, the latter being a contributor to financial crises. And, as a previous financial crisis recedes over time, it is not unusual to believe that a new era has arrived. In such conditions, Cassandra like warnings that nothing basic has changed and there is a financial breaking point that can have severe economic consequences are ignored.</p>
<p>One paragraph can&rsquo;t do full justice to the breadth of Minsky&rsquo;s thinking, but I believe the core of it is clear<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Before wrapping the theory part up, let me also set out some of the important work done by historians. Charles Kindleberger drew on case studies to point out that the connections between financial markets and macro economies extended beyond those running through money flows (the banking system), and they can operate via arbitrage in internationally traded commodities. Autonomous shocks can change investment opportunities prompting high spirits and an overshooting of equilibrium price levels. But over time such expectations of continuous asset price rises weaken and distress sets in. The movement out of liquid assets into the now overvalued illiquid assets reverses and, if precipitous, a crash or panic ensues<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. Kindleberger drew on Adam Smith&rsquo;s observation that &ldquo;when the profits of trade happen to be greater than ordinary, overtrading becomes a general error<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>. And the rate of profit&rdquo; is always highest in the countries that are going fastest to ruin<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>More recently, Harold James has reminded us that although the Great Depression on both sides of the Atlantic is often associated with bank failures, there was a critical interaction with financial markets. The effect of this was to reduce the wealth and collateral available for corporations and individuals to borrow, which led to a reduced credit supply, forcing borrower liquidation of assets thereby pushing asset prices down further. This was the debt deflation of Irving Fisher and the credit channel of transmission of Ben Bernanke. Moreover, as James notes, surviving sudden crises requires extraordinary public policy measures to be used &ndash; such as short-run actions to alleviate long-run problems, even if on their own they are not compatible with long-run stability<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Enough theory and history. I hope though that you will understand why it matters. I am going to use the rest of my time to apply it to today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>First of all, let me make an overall point. There is a tension in financial stability between the overall or macro-prudential approach and one that is more of a disaggregated list of stuff that could go wrong and cause a wider crisis. Macro-prudential policy has to stay focused on risks that could threaten the system as a whole, taking into account correlations, concentrations, interconnectedness and opacity. This macro-pru approach is more ambitious and harder to pull off. It can come and go in terms of the attention it gets, the cycle of which tends to be related to the incidence of crises. A good (or bad) crisis tends to provide a more macro focus for a time, but then as memories fade the list approach can come back to prominence. I believe we have to push against such a list-like tendency keeping our focus on the system-wide perspective, and the correlated, concentrated, interconnected and opaque positions that matter for the stability of the system as a whole. This is the spirit of Minsky and others, and it provides a firmer grounding. So, Message One, taking the macro-prudential approach matters, and yes it can be harder.</p>
<p>Onto the second message. Cassandra was fated by the god Apollo to utter true prophecies but not to be believed. The prophecies were of course not of the good sort. In financial stability speak she dedicated herself to one tail of the distribution. Somebody will of course say that she was ahead of her times, and thereby missed her vocation as a central banker. Let me borrow her mantle for a moment, in the context of Minsky&rsquo;s argument that memories of financial crises recede over time and can be replaced by thoughts of a new era arriving. I can observe this happening with the global financial crisis fifteen years or so on. I do get people telling me that &lsquo;you have solved that one so we can relax&rsquo;. But the work I set out above on theory and history is timeless. So, let&rsquo;s not fall into the trap of complacency. Yes, we must debate the right level of regulation, it cannot be assumed to be perfect, but let&rsquo;s not confuse that with the timeless nature of the threat. That&rsquo;s Message Two.</p>
<p>My third message is to pick up the theme that was at the heart of Minsky&rsquo;s critique of Keynesian economics post-war, though not of Keynes himself, and is also reinforced by Kindleberger and James. This is that money and finance matter together because they interact and in so doing create instability. One of the blind alleys that this type of debate went along before the financial crisis was to see it only in terms of whether there were asset price bubbles or not. Ultimately that was not only a blind alley but a dangerous one too.</p>
<p>Since the financial crisis we have seen a change in the relative scale globally of bank and non-bank finance, with the balance shifting towards the latter. And so the focus of authorities has shifted, rightly, towards the latter too. You can see this in the work programme of the global Financial Stability Board. In one sense, we should not be surprised by this shift. We have upped the regulation of banks, reflecting the lessons of the crisis.</p>
<p>But then we should remember the focus of Minsky and others. The macroprudential risks of the non-bank sector have not originated from this shift, they have been there for well over a century or more. Kindleberger&rsquo;s study of the 1873 panic affecting Berlin, New York and Vienna is a good illustration of this<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-address-at-the-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>. The contemporary shift in the balance of intermediation towards non-banks makes such risks more pressing, but it should not be thought of as new. That&rsquo;s Message Three.</p>
<p>The non-bank word and its interaction with the banking world &ndash; money and finance as Minsky put it &ndash; has evolved in ways that require us to look not just at regulation, but at two additional key components of our response as authorities, namely the tools of surveillance and the tools of remedy.</p>
<p>I will start with surveillance. The non-bank sector is very large and growing. It is disparate in nature, opaque in important places and the interlinkages are, unsurprisingly, therefore complex and hard to observe. In the banking sector we have developed post-crisis our stress testing tools. At their core, these are institution specific, though to leave it there would be a mistake and so we have developed cross-sector tools to capture system-wide risks. For example, where the actions of individual banks to restrict credit lead to a collectively worse outcome for the system.</p>
<p>For the non-bank sector and its interaction with the bank sector we have to focus on stress exercises that simulate the spread of stress and thereby seek to pick out the institutional points of weakness and lack of resilience, for instance in markets and infrastructures as well as the firms themselves. I think this is very much in the spirit of Minsky. At the Bank of England we are conducting our first System Wide Exploratory Scenario. It doesn&rsquo;t claim to cover every risk in the system, you should be disbelieving if I said otherwise. It is more in the way of a flow test &ndash; simulate shocks, let them flow through the system and see what happens. We expect to report on the results by the end of this year. Message Four is that we need to develop more of these tools of surveillance of risks.</p>
<p>You will I am sure be pleased to know that my fifth point is the last. It covers the tools of response that authorities use in a crisis. As I noted earlier, Harold James has set out how surviving such crises requires extraordinary measures to solve short-run situations and alleviate long-run problems, but on their own such approaches may not be compatible with long-run stability. This can sound like an impasse, but I don&rsquo;t see it that way. Central banks are the providers of liquidity of last resort to the banking system. That we should use this extensively in a crisis and be expected to do so was at the heart of Walter Bagehot&rsquo;s stricture of the Bank of England in the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. It remains a key tenet of how central banks should operate. There are at least three accompanying parts to operating the Bagehot approach in practice.</p>
<p>The first is that money is unique, it&rsquo;s different from finance. It must at all times hold its nominal value, whereas the nominal value of finance (assets) should and will naturally vary. Second, the way money has developed within the discipline of holding its nominal value means what I call the singleness of money. Banking systems have developed so that money is made up of central bank money (the stuff we create) and commercial bank money (bank deposits). The singleness of money applies critically as the glue across both. This is why central banks need to be responsible for monetary policy and bank regulation. The third accompanying part is an assumption that if a central bank injects money into the banking system, it will naturally find its way to all the places in need, at a price of course. In other words, if there is a liquidity need in the non-bank world, we can reach it via the banks.</p>
<p>I think Minsky was not a dissenter from the first two propositions but was sceptical about the third. Moreover, Kindleberger used case studies to cast doubt on the third. In my view the modern growth of the non-bank sector has cast more doubt on the effectiveness of the third proposition. For a long time in history there have been emergency interventions to forestall financial stability problems in the non-bank world. But we are left trying to square a circle. Can we preserve the uniqueness of money as a feature of the banking system and intervene where needed to solve such financial stability problems in the non-bank sector?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think the answer is yes. Money is unique and the relationship between central banks and the banking system is unique too. This was Bagehot&rsquo;s point at a high level. Banks must have access to central bank liquidity on a standing basis &ndash; i.e. all of the time. To do otherwise is to ask for trouble. And this underpins the singleness of money which ensures that central bank and commercial bank money are fully aligned in nominal (and real) value terms. In normal times, that should take care of the needs of the non-bank sector because the liquidity should reach where it is needed via banks. But in times of stress it may not. To avoid a systemic crisis, and reflecting the growth of the non-bank sector, central banks should consider permanent emergency facilities for non-banks. But these should not be standing facilities, because the value of money is not the issue here. Non-banks cannot decide when they would like access to the central bank. Rather the central bank can trigger or activate these facilities if it senses stressed conditions and their possible economic consequences warrant such action. But these facilities are temporary in their availability and should be unwound and repaid as soon as possible. I think this deals with Harold James&rsquo;s point about short and long-run consistency.</p>
<p>You may already be aware that at the Bank of England this is what we are doing, by putting into place emergency facilities for a range of non-banks which we consider exposed to the systemic risks that should call the use of such facilities into action. But to reiterate, these are not standing facilities of the traditional sort.</p>
<p>Minsky&rsquo;s analysis is pertinent today as memories of the Global Financial Crises recede and the discussion moves on to putting more emphasis on growth and competition in economies and the role of finance in these objectives. To be clear, these objectives are important, no doubt about that. But we have learned from hard experience that we can only achieve them with a foundation of financial stability. There isn&rsquo;t a trade-off. The best contribution we as financial stability policymakers can make to sustainable economic growth is to ensure that the financial system is resilient when shocks hit.</p>
<p>That foundation requires confidence in the nominal value of money and therefore it&rsquo;s singleness. Money and finance are different and should be treated as such. Profits and some losses should be made as the normal state of affairs. We should not use regulation to limit these outcomes beyond enabling efficient markets with strong institutional foundations and well-established rules of the game. But as authorities, it is our job to intervene to prevent damage to the foundations of financial stability which could in turn compromise economic growth. Those interventions can be continuous in the sense of regulations or emergency and temporary where the threat is so great and costly that it would be inefficient to regulate constantly on the assumption that something on such a scale will happen more regularly. Most of the tail of bad outcomes is best dealt with by regulation, but the very extreme end can be better tackled by one off interventions. That is not a failure of regulation.</p>
<p>To sum up, I have five messages on financial stability. System-wide matters and should not disappear amid laundry lists. Second, we must heed Minsky&rsquo;s warning that memories of financial crises past do recede. Message three is that we have seen a shift in financial intermediation towards non-banks &ndash; from money to finance if you like and this presents distinct challenges. Message four is that one of these challenges is the pressing need for new surveillance tools. And message five is that there is also a need for central banks to reconsider their liquidity provision tools to non-banks while not undermining the singleness and uniqueness of money.</p>

<title>"A Feature, Not A Bug: The Important Role Of Capital Markets In The U.S." Remarks Before The Bloomberg Global Regulatory Forum, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., Oct. 22, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-feature-not-a-bug-the-important-role-of-capital-markets-in-the-us-remark/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-feature-not-a-bug-the-important-role-of-capital-markets-in-the-us-remark/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Mary, for the kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about the importance of capital markets and nonbank finance. The global regulatory community often debates this sector&rsquo;s resiliency. Let me be clear: promoting financial resiliency is at the core of the SEC&rsquo;s mission. In normal times, it helps promote trust in capital markets. In times of stress, it protects investors, issuers, and markets alike.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Today, though, I&rsquo;d like to focus on the important value of nonbank finance and to contextualize its risks. In summary, let me make three observations.</p>
<p>First, the U.S. economy and, importantly, the public&mdash;both investors and issuers&mdash;benefit from our large, vibrant $120 trillion capital markets. These markets are nearly five times larger than our $26 trillion banking and credit union sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Compared to other major economies, this ratio, and our significant reliance on the capital markets, is a distinguishing element of our economy. I believe this is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Finance, at its core, is about the pricing and allocation of money and risk. The nonbank sector plays a critical role in that price discovery. Further, transparency and liquidity in the public capital markets provide a public good, leading to more efficient allocation and pricing of capital. Academic research has long documented that strong capital markets promote economic growth, and may even provide greater resilience in crises.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Second, the nonbank sector provides important alternatives and competition to the banking sector. This competition benefits investors, savers, borrowers, and issuers, as well as banks themselves.</p>
<p>Third, when it comes to risk and fragility in finance, it&rsquo;s important not to paint with a broad brush. Not every risk is the same. In fact, the financial sector is about allocating and pricing risk, not eliminating it. It&rsquo;s important to focus on the activities that are more likely to contribute to fragility in the system.</p>
<p>For instance, money-like liabilities, particularly deposits, money market funds, and reverse repurchase agreements (repo), can raise systemic risks. Interconnectedness or significant leverage also can raise such risks. Entities providing material maturity or liquidity transformation also can raise such risks. But not all aspects of the nonbank sector have these particular, or other, risks that heighten financial fragility. It&rsquo;s also important, while considering resiliency, not to discount the contribution that nonbank markets make to efficiency, liquidity, and transparency.</p>
<p>Though reports on nonbank finance may discuss it through the lens of entities,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;I want to discuss it through the lens of five activities: money instruments, Treasury markets, credit markets, private funds, and equity markets. Since that is plenty, I won&rsquo;t have time today to cover other important cross-cutting operational issues for banks and nonbanks, including: artificial intelligence, cyber resilience, and third-party service providers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The SEC has taken up important projects in each of these areas.</p>
<p><span>Money Instruments</span></p>
<p>When people talk about money, most think about cash in your pocket or digital cash&mdash;which is actually bank deposits. There also are important capital markets cash-like instruments, including money market funds and the funding in reverse repo markets. All of these cash-like products have a similar attribute: they can be redeemed on demand or daily at par value.</p>
<p>Given that cash-like feature and ability to redeem on demand, they&rsquo;ve been at the center of runs in times of stress.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen bank runs, both in real life and in movies such as<i>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life.&nbsp;</i>Bank instability is not just a matter of history or fictional characters, though, as we grappled with this as recently as last year, with several runs on regional banks here in the U.S. as well as the events that brought Credit Suisse to the brink.</p>
<p>We also have seen, in times of stress, rapid redemptions at some money market funds as investors feared dilution or illiquidity.</p>
<p>Money market funds were created 50 years ago to meet the needs of savers and investors looking for higher returns than bank deposits. The investing public also has confidence that they&rsquo;re backed one-to-one by assets like Treasury bills and other short-term investments. At $6.7 trillion today, they generate higher returns on average and are more secure for savers and investors than bank deposits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Money market funds, though, share the potential structural liquidity mismatch faced by banks. Investors can redeem their money market fund holdings on a daily basis, even if those funds keep some of their holdings in securities with less liquidity.</p>
<p>Thus, after the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC adopted a series of reforms for money market funds. Given that we saw further stress in money market funds during the dash-for-cash in 2020, we took the matter up again, adopting further reforms to enhance these funds&rsquo; resiliency and protections against dilution, which were fully implemented earlier this month.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>I would note, though, there are other funds (over $2 trillion in aggregate) that have cash-like characteristics, such as Short-Term Investment Funds, Local Government Investment Pools, and offshore Money Market Funds, that are outside the SEC&rsquo;s purview and the reforms I mentioned.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s important that relevant authorities consider reforms to enhance resiliency and protect against regulatory gaps.</p>
<p>Another capital market activity with cash-like characteristics is the repo market. Market participants are able to exchange their cash with counterparties seeking funding for their Treasuries or other fixed-income securities. Nonbanks, including hedge funds, money market funds, broker-dealers, and others, as well as banks, all play significant roles in the more than $6 trillion repo markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>At times, we&rsquo;ve seen stress in these markets, particularly in the Treasury funding markets in 2019. That&rsquo;s part of why last December, we adopted rules to facilitate greater central clearing of U.S. Treasuries in both cash and funding markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>While on the topic of money instruments, I want to highlight an additional risk, though one in the banking, rather than nonbank, sector. As it relates to bank deposits, it&rsquo;s not just the $20 trillion of deposits in the domestic commercial banking and credit union sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s another $13 trillion of dollar funding offshore in non-U.S. banks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Many of these overseas dollar deposits are uninsured. We&rsquo;ve seen stress in Eurodollar markets disrupt economies around the globe, such as during the &lsquo;08 crisis. Though the Federal Reserve operates central bank liquidity swap lines with select central banks, I believe there may be more work for those of us in the global regulatory community to ensure resiliency in the offshore Eurodollar markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p><span>Treasury Markets</span></p>
<p>That brings me to our $28 trillion Treasury markets. They are the base upon which our entire capital markets are built. They are integral to how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy. They are how we, as a government and taxpayers, raise money. We are the issuer.</p>
<p>These markets also have three relevant characteristics: deep participation of both bank and nonbank intermediaries, use of leverage, and repeated jitters over the decades.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>As I mentioned, market participants often fund their positions with Treasury repos. The resulting leverage often connects banks and broker-dealers to hedge funds and others to whom they are providing such funding. This interconnectedness can create systemic fragility. An independent study of non-centrally cleared bilateral repo data from June 2022 found that 74 percent of pilot volume was transacted at zero haircut.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Further, this market has been characterized by repeated jitters over time, from the 1980s to the 2008 crisis, to the dash-for-cash in 2020, to the regional bank crisis in March 2023.</p>
<p>Given the importance, leverage, interconnectedness, and repeated jitters of the Treasury markets, we&rsquo;ve embarked on key reforms with Secretary Yellen&rsquo;s guidance and working with the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ve broadened the scope of transactions required for central clearing. By March 2025, Treasury clearinghouses must separate proprietary margin from customer margin and further facilitate access to central clearing. Starting at the end of 2025, certain cash transactions will have to be cleared. Starting in June 2026, certain repo and reverse repo transactions must be cleared.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Second, we also now require firms that act as dealers to register as such with the Commission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p><span>Credit Markets</span></p>
<p>Let me now turn to the credit markets, including both commercial and consumer credit.</p>
<p>In the U.S., we benefit from robust competition between banks and nonbanks. A distinguishing and critical part of our financial sector is that debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. These markets are varied and deep, which benefits investors and borrowers. Compare this to Europe, the U.K., and Asia, where only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Our various markets for commercial and consumer credit live and compete side-by-side. The greater reliance of the U.S. on capital markets leads to increased competition and efficient allocation and pricing of capital and risk. Such competition promotes efficiency, diversification, and flexibility, with significant benefits for borrowers and investors alike.</p>
<p>For context, the markets for dollar funding of commercial credit are approximately $30 trillion. This includes the $11 trillion corporate debt market,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;the $1.4 trillion broadly syndicated loan market,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;an estimated $1.7 trillion private credit market,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;and commercial and industrial loans by U.S. banks of about $2.8 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s also a sizeable $13 trillion offshore market for U.S. dollar borrowing in Eurobonds and Euroloans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Americans looking to purchase a home, a car, or have a credit card, also have long benefitted from the development of the nearly $14 trillion mortgage and asset securitization markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Pooling mortgages and other assets into securities brings more investors into the markets. The majority of mortgages and consumer lending either directly access the capital markets, or at least indirectly benefit from referencing the pricing of the markets.</p>
<p>Everyday investors also participate in the credit markets through registered investment funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;These funds play an important and growing role in the ownership of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.</p>
<p>Banks also benefit from vibrant nonbank credit markets. First, banks are able to reference the price discovery in the public markets and lower their risk. Second, banks are able to work with clients on their clients&rsquo; funding needs, while outsourcing the actual funding to other markets, such as through broadly syndicated loans. Third, banks also are significant borrowers in the capital markets, including to meet their requirements to issue loss-absorbing capital.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p>All this said, we need to promote efficiency, integrity, and resiliency of these markets&mdash;and that is what our agency does day in and day out. First, robust disclosures, along with protecting against fraud and misconduct, are important to investors. They also promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets. That&rsquo;s why, under the securities laws, we have robust disclosure requirements, including for corporate debt, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;ve seen times when risks can spill out into the broader economy, such as from the mortgage and derivatives markets in the &lsquo;08 crisis. That&rsquo;s why Congress implemented reforms around mortgage underwriting and swaps.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;As mandated by those reforms, the SEC adopted a rule last year prohibiting those who sell or facilitate the sale of an asset-backed security from engaging in transactions that involve or result in conflicts with investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;Additionally, entities subject to rules creating a regime for the registration and regulation of security-based swap execution facilities were required to begin complying in August 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p>Earlier this year, the SEC also adopted amendments to make portfolio data of registered investment funds available more frequently to the public. The more frequent disclosure not only gives investors more regular access to how their funds are meeting their investment objectives, but also supports the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of these funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;To add to the aggregate public data regarding registered funds, this year we began publishing the new Registered Fund Statistics report.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a></p>
<p>Before I turn to private funds, one area of the credit markets that has grown significantly in recent years is private credit. This growing field contributes to competition in our credit markets. As with any other emerging field in finance, though, it also bears monitoring for challenges and risks. For instance, is it raising some risks regarding regulatory arbitrage? What are the risks with regard to the intersection of private credit with the banking and insurance sectors? How are credit ratings being used in this field? Further, though private credit has existed in some form for years, given its size has increased significantly, how will it weather times of stress at today&rsquo;s magnitude or greater?</p>
<p><span>Private Funds</span></p>
<p>Turning to private funds, the U.S. also benefits from robust competition between private and public capital markets. The $30 trillion private fund sector&mdash;private equity, private credit funds, hedge funds, venture capital&mdash;surpasses the size of the U.S. banking sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Private funds and their advisers play an important role in nearly every sector of the capital markets. On one side are the funds&rsquo; investors, such as retirement plans or endowments. Standing behind those entities are millions of investors like municipal workers, teachers, firefighters, professors, students, and more. On the other side are issuers raising capital from private funds, ranging from startups to late-stage companies.</p>
<p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the events a decade earlier regarding Long-Term Capital Management, Congress understood that such funds could affect financial stability. Thus, Congress directed the SEC to collect information from private funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;Given the significant growth and changes in this field, we recently updated Form PF, an important reporting tool for private fund advisers to provide transparency into funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;In adding to the aggregate public data published by the SEC, we updated and enhanced public reporting of information about leverage, borrowing, and other activities regarding hedge funds, private equity funds, and other private funds from Form PF.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p>An aspect of some private funds is significant leverage, particularly among certain large multi-strategy and macro hedge funds. Many hedge funds are receiving the vast majority of their repo financing in the non-centrally cleared market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;The rules we adopted last year regarding the Treasury markets will broaden the scope of transactions clearinghouse members must clear, which will bring greater efficiency and resiliency to this market. Under these rules, in June of 2026, clearinghouses will need to ensure their members clear all their repo and reverse repo transactions, including with hedge funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<p>Further, last year, we finalized rules to increase transparency to investors regarding fees, performance, and side letters.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;This rule would have promoted greater competition and efficiency in this important part of the markets. In June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit subsequently vacated the rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></p>
<p><span>Equity Markets</span></p>
<p>Before closing, I&rsquo;ll mention the largest of the nonbank sectors. With more than half of all American households investing in our $55 trillion equity markets, they are critical to issuers and investors alike.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Spoiler alert: we&rsquo;re focused on increasing efficiency and resiliency, lowering cost and risk here, too.</p>
<p>Last month, the Commission unanimously approved the most important updates to the equity markets since 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>&nbsp;Earlier this year, the Commission also unanimously adopted final rules to enhance disclosure requirements for order execution quality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></p>
<p>We reduced what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;tick size&rdquo; for many stocks down to a new minimum of half a penny, allowing stocks to be priced more efficiently and competitively, reducing distortions, and lowering the costs of trading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></p>
<p>We also have made our market plumbing more efficient. Back in May, the U.S. successfully shortened the clearing and settlement cycle to T+1 for equities, corporate bonds, and municipal securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-bloomberg-global-regulatory-forum-102224#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>Let me conclude where I began. The U.S. economy and, importantly, the public&mdash;both investors and issuers&mdash;benefit from our large, vibrant $120 trillion capital markets. Second, the nonbank sector provides important alternatives and competition to the banking sector. Third, it&rsquo;s important not to paint with a broad brush when considering systemic risk. We should focus on the activities that are more likely to contribute to fragility in the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do at the SEC in fulfilling our three-part mission: to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. We&rsquo;ve taken on numerous projects to ensure efficiency, integrity, and resiliency in our capital markets.</p>
<p>While nonbank intermediation is not without risk, on balance, our entire economy benefits from the breadth, depth, and liquidity of our capital markets.</p>

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen At Press Conference Ahead Of The 2024 Annual Meetings Of The International Monetary Fund And World Bank</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-by-us-secretary-of-the-treasury-janet-l-yellen-at-press-conference-ahea-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let me thank the IMF and the World Bank for hosting these meetings and all of you for attending today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start by stepping back and speaking about how far we&rsquo;ve come. Three years ago when I attended my first Annual Meetings as Treasury Secretary, the COVID-19 pandemic was raging. Many of the events were virtual. The IMF had just revised downward its projections for global economic growth due to continued supply chain disruptions and new COVID variants.</p>
<p>Today, the situation is very different. Though progress across economies has been uneven, the global economy has proven resilient. America&rsquo;s strong economic performance is leading the way as a key engine of global growth. At home, thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s economic agenda, we went from millions having lost their jobs to a historic labor market recovery. Unemployment is near all-time lows and U.S. real wage growth has outperformed that of most other advanced economies. U.S. economic growth has also been almost twice as fast as most other advanced economies this year and last, even as inflation came down sooner. As a recent Brookings analysis puts it, &ldquo;the U.S. is significantly outperforming its peers.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re now working to sustain this momentum, including through major investments in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy that other countries have sought to emulate. This morning the IMF again upgraded its forecast for the U.S. outlook, as it did in 2023, when U.S. growth ultimately came in at almost double the IMF&rsquo;s projection earlier that year.</p>
<p>Our Administration has also been focused beyond our borders. From day one, we rejected isolationism that made America and the world worse off and pursued global economic leadership that supports economies around the world and brings significant benefits to the American people and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>We will further this approach this week, including by together continuing to respond to global conflicts. For more than two years, the coalition we formed in the immediate aftermath of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has stood strong. Our novel price cap on Russian oil has restricted Russia&rsquo;s revenues while keeping global energy markets well-supplied. We continue cracking down on Russian sanctions evasion, and as soon as next week we will unveil strong new sanctions targeting those facilitating the Kremlin&rsquo;s war machine, including intermediaries in third countries that are supplying Russia with critical inputs for its military. We have also been working tirelessly to unlock the economic value of the Russian sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions to support Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States is also using all the tools at our disposal in response to the conflict in the Middle East. We have worked to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its destructive behavior across the region by sanctioning terrorist actors including Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah, with over 1,000 Iran-related sanctions since 2021 and multiple rounds of designations in recent weeks. Earlier this month, we took additional decisive action to intensify pressure on Iran in response to Iran&rsquo;s attack on Israel, expanding sanctions to target Iran&rsquo;s efforts to channel revenues from its energy industry to finance deadly activities.</p>
<p>And we are more broadly focused on doing what we can to increase stability in the region, including by working to ensure that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza, imposing sanctions on Israeli violent extremist settlers, and pressing Israel to maintain vital correspondent banking relationships with Palestinian banks. We look forward to the Israeli cabinet extending the waivers to preserve correspondent banking relationships for banks in the West Bank by the end of the month deadline to support economic stability in the West Bank.</p>
<p>This week, we&rsquo;ll maintain our focus not only on taking decisive action in response to conflicts, but also on addressing challenges that threaten to hold back global growth, such as emerging markets and developing countries facing significant debt vulnerabilities and a desperate need for investments in infrastructure and clean energy.</p>
<p>One of many devastating impacts of Russia&rsquo;s war on Ukraine has been the spike in food insecurity, so we worked with partners to support the launch of the International Financial Institution Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity and have seen it deliver results. IFIs increased lending to the food and agriculture sector by 60 percent following Russia&rsquo;s invasion and maintained that level of support through 2023. We now affirm President Banga&rsquo;s commitment to reduce hunger and generate jobs by increasing investment in food systems and will continue to work with the IFIs to move this work forward.</p>
<p>To strengthen health systems, as the current mpox outbreak underscores remains urgent, we continue to support the Pandemic Fund, which has now allocated funding to projects in more than 40 countries across all regions.</p>
<p>Confronting climate change of course also remains at the top of our agenda. The MDBs committed a record high of nearly $75 billion in climate finance to low- and middle-income countries in 2023, a 45 percent increase from 2021, and are deploying new tools to help countries respond to crises and increase resilience. We will continue to work to make climate finance easier to access and to support additional private capital mobilization at the MDBs and through the climate and environment trust funds. There, we should turn to implementing the recommendations of the recently finalized review of the climate finance architecture that we worked with G20 partners to launch.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve made significant progress putting conflict and fragility, pandemics, and climate change at the core of the MDBs&rsquo; work through the Evolution agenda. The MDBs have responsibly stretched their balance sheets and pursued innovative financial measures that will enable $200 billion in additional lending capacity over the next ten years. And as of July, the G20 estimates that measures that have already been identified could enable an additional almost $160 billion. This nearly $360 billion in total would be an annual increase of over 20 percent compared to 2023.</p>
<p>Let me end by emphasizing that all of the investments we make&mdash;in food security, global health, climate, and more&mdash;won&rsquo;t deliver results if many low- and middle-income countries are devoting more resources to debt service than to spending on development priorities. We&rsquo;ve made progress to strengthen our institutions to address these issues. We reached a historic agreement on a 16th General Review of Quotas at the IMF, which will increase IMF quotas by 50 percent so that it can continue playing its crucial role at the center of the global safety net, and approved capital increases at the EBRD and IDB Invest.</p>
<p>But we need to do more. As we look ahead, our Administration will keep pushing to further improve the Common Framework to quickly get support to countries in debt distress; calling for an IDA replenishment with a financing package and policy priorities that meet the needs of low-income countries; and implementing the Nairobi-Washington Vision that President Biden and President Ruto launched in May so that countries with strong policy frameworks facing liquidity stress receive the financing support they need to realize their sustainable development ambitions.</p>
<p>Many of the challenges we face cannot be solved overnight. But I am convinced that the sustained American economic leadership and engagement with partners we first restored and then strengthened over the past three and a half years will be indispensable as we move forward. I look forward to furthering this approach this week as we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I will now take your questions.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Four Companies With Misleading Cyber Disclosures - One Company, Unisys Corp., Also Charged With Controls Violations</title>

<div> SEC, cybersecurity, companies, penalties, disclosures
Summary:<br />SEC charges Unisys, Avaya, Check Point, and Mimecast for misleading cybersecurity disclosures, with penalties, violations, and investigation involving SolarWinds hack. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged four current and former public companies &ndash; Unisys Corp., Avaya Holdings Corp., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, and Mimecast Limited &ndash; with making materially misleading disclosures regarding cybersecurity risks and intrusions. The SEC also charged Unisys with disclosure controls and procedures violations. The companies agreed to pay the following civil penalties to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unisys will pay a $4 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>Avaya. will pay a $1 million civil penalty;</li>
<li>Check Point will pay a $995,000 civil penalty; and</li>
<li>Mimecast will pay a $990,000 civil penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>The charges against the four companies result from an investigation involving public companies potentially impacted by the compromise of SolarWinds&rsquo; Orion software and by other related activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As today&rsquo;s enforcement actions reflect, while public companies may become targets of cyberattacks, it is incumbent upon them to not further victimize their shareholders or other members of the investing public by providing misleading disclosures about the cybersecurity incidents they have encountered,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Here, the SEC&rsquo;s orders find that these companies provided misleading disclosures about the incidents at issue, leaving investors in the dark about the true scope of the incidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s orders, Unisys, Avaya, and Check Point learned in 2020, and Mimecast learned in 2021, that the threat actor likely behind the SolarWinds Orion hack had accessed their systems without authorization, but each negligently minimized its cybersecurity incident in its public disclosures. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Unisys finds that the company described its risks from cybersecurity events as hypothetical despite knowing that it had experienced two SolarWinds-related intrusions involving exfiltration of gigabytes of data. The order also finds that these materially misleading disclosures resulted in part from Unisys&rsquo; deficient disclosure controls. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Avaya finds that it stated that the threat actor had accessed a &ldquo;limited number of [the] Company&rsquo;s email messages,&rdquo; when Avaya knew the threat actor had also accessed at least 145 files in its cloud file sharing environment. The SEC&rsquo;s order against Check Point finds that it knew of the intrusion but described cyber intrusions and risks from them in generic terms. The order charging Mimecast finds that the company minimized the attack by failing to disclose the nature of the code the threat actor exfiltrated and the quantity of encrypted credentials the threat actor accessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Downplaying the extent of a material cybersecurity breach is a bad strategy,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &ldquo;In two of these cases, the relevant cybersecurity risk factors were framed hypothetically or generically when the companies knew the warned of risks had already materialized.&nbsp; The federal securities laws prohibit half-truths, and there is no exception for statements in risk-factor disclosures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s orders find that each company violated certain applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and related rules thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, each company agreed to cease and desist from future violations of the charged provisions and to pay the penalties described above. Each company cooperated during the investigation, including by voluntarily providing analyses or presentations that helped expedite the staff&rsquo;s investigation and by voluntarily taking steps to enhance its cybersecurity controls.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation involving the four companies was conducted by Arsen Ablaev and Michael Baker of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU) and David D&rsquo;Addio in the Boston Regional Office. It was supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman and Mr. Tenreiro of the CACU and Kathryn A. Pyszka of the Chicago Regional Office.&nbsp;</p>

<title>GLEIF Opens Mumbai Office To Support Continued Widespread LEI Adoption In India  - India Enjoys Highest Rates Of LEI Growth Across All Markets Globally In 2024, As Regulation Embeds The LEI As A Cornerstone Of The Indian Economy</title>

<div> India, LEI growth, regulatory mandates, GLEIF Mumbai office, APAC expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
India sees significant LEI growth with regulatory support. GLEIF opens Mumbai office to engage stakeholders, raise awareness, and drive LEI adoption. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC0XauvKen-2BAw2v2fpxe0d5OB7kpOD2qg5qGAWrLPTM21OkeU_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgopkqlx8cS0FFNxZUe51piZ6n6okyeDMJdkH51q5lbJ1CbKrK-2FN9A2-2FZ3E0Qhk1jsCvnSIougtAdmFq1VzyVxoyVsDakOHlOiDaANE-2BoTW4rr2jUCktFyqywz7VD8fctfshg9fBSFWiAacN6IMjrAQKxvC5O6D7mCg4qx9LlCJS6lPoHaL4vPGVS9i06INVcy7A2Fa9MrYUXCoNkvf0V1hfDpwdeZMhD3LQPQgGQ-2FXjn6jQPZeO0gMu-2FY3qvlS9Fy97VucssVEABK-2BMTt7vAx76274OduCLh2VHwilhHRIBmw-3D-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a><span>&nbsp;(GLEIF), headquartered in Switzerland, has opened an office in Mumbai, India. The organization is expanding its 'on-the-ground' presence to gain deeper insights into local market dynamics and to provide enhanced support to regional authorities, businesses, and other Global LEI System stakeholders as demand for Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) continues to escalate across the Indian subcontinent.</span></p>
<p>In Q3 2023, India became one of the top jurisdictions with the highest LEI growth rate globally, a position it currently retains. It has been among the top five LEI growth jurisdictions since 2020 and is also one of the leading markets worldwide for LEI renewals.</p>
<p>The LEI has become a key tool in enabling trust and transparency across the Indian financial ecosystem, thanks to a proactive regulatory agenda advanced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).&nbsp; Significant levels of new LEI issuance in the region annually, as well as high levels of LEI renewals, can be attributed directly to this extensive regulation and the need for organizations to comply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2017, LEI mandates covering the derivatives and non-derivatives markets, corporate borrowing, large value payments and cross-border transactions have been steadily introduced by RBI. The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) have also since mandated or required the LEI for various KYC activities, to enhance transparency and track the financial exposure of an entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, an RBI report titled <a href="https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/PAYMENTSVISION2025844D11300C884DC4ACB8E56B7348F4D4.PDF">'Payments Vision 2025'</a><a href="https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/PublicationReport/Pdfs/PAYMENTSVISION2025844D11300C884DC4ACB8E56B7348F4D4.PDF">,</a> published in 2022, outlined the LEI's role in enabling secure, convenient and accessible payments. It details the RBI's ambition to broaden the scope, usage and relevance of the LEI in all payment activities.</p>
<p>GLEIF's CEO, Alexandre Kech, comments: "Building closer engagement with key markets globally is part of GLEIF's strategy to ease and support LEI adoption, with the broader aim of hardwiring trust into every business relationship. LEI deployment in India is flourishing right now, thanks to regulation which has made the LEI foundational to trust across the economy. This makes it a relevant and compelling time to expand GLEIF's near-at-hand presence within the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to supporting business-as-usual LEI deployment, we also want to spread awareness of the trust and transparency that the LEI &ndash; and its digital counterpart, the verifiable LEI (vLEI) - can bring to all forms of digital identity management ecosystems. GLEIF's combined organizational identity offering can fuel innovation, evolution and transformation across all sectors and beyond mandates. With so many Indian organizations now in possession of an LEI, we aim to help the market to optimize the many valuable opportunities to derive much broader value from it, beyond compliance with mandates."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The establishment of the new office, overseen by Vikas Panwar, GLEIF's Country Business Manager - India, is strategically designed to bolster GLEIF's capacity to actively engage and collaborate directly with Indian LEI stakeholders and regulators at a localized level. Its primary objective is to provide comprehensive awareness on the extended utility of LEIs beyond regulatory compliance. Furthermore, GLEIF's in-country team will spearhead pilot programs aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of LEIs in identity management initiatives across diverse industry verticals and sectors.</p>
<p>There is a strong and established LEI issuance ecosystem in India, with two local LEI issuers and two Validation Agents already serving the market: Legal Entity Identifier India Ltd., National Securities Depository Limited, Rubix Data Sciences and MNS Credit Management, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>GLEIF's Mumbai office is its third in the APAC region. The first Asian office to open was in the Chiyoda Ward of Tokyo in late 2021, and this was followed in 2023 by the launch of an office in Singapore. GLEIF now has six offices worldwide, across Europe, North America and Asia, ensuring strong local representation in key countries globally.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Report, Tokenisation, Financial stability, Crypto-assets, FSB<br />
<br />Summary: FSB Chair's letter calls for continued momentum in addressing financial system vulnerabilities. Tokenisation adoption is low, but poses risks. Challenges remain for crypto-asset regulation. <div>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span><em>FSB Chair calls for continued momentum in addressing longstanding financial system vulnerabilities related&nbsp;<a>to elevated debt levels and asset valuations, non-bank liquidity and leverage, and asset and funding market interlinkages.</a></em></span></li>
<li><span>Accompanying report on tokenisation finds low adoption in the financial sector to date, but warns that financial stability risks could rise if tokenisation scales up significantly and if identified vulnerabilities are not adequately addressed.</span></li>
<li><span>Jurisdictions have made progress in implementing the policy and regulatory responses to address the risks of crypto-assets, developed by the IMF, FSB, and standard-setting bodies (SSBs), but challenges remain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-october-2024/">letter from its Chair, Klaas Knot, to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors</a>, ahead of their meeting on 23-24 October.</p>
<p>Fears over the global economic outlook are easing, with a number of central banks cutting interest rates. The letter warns of vulnerabilities associated with high debt levels and asset prices, the interaction of non-bank liquidity and leverage, and the connections between different asset and funding markets, illustrated by the short-lived market volatility in August.</p>
<p>The letter outlines the work the FSB has undertaken on financial innovation, payments systems, and cyber and operational resilience. It also introduces the reports the FSB is submitting to the G20 addressing these issues, including:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/the-financial-stability-implications-of-tokenisation/">The financial stability implications of tokenisation</a>. Tokenisation of assets may have the potential to improve efficiencies and provide access to new markets for investors, but it can also amplify many of the vulnerabilities seen in traditional finance. The FSB report focuses on tokenisation based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), which is the technology used in most tokenisation initiatives. The limited publicly available data on tokenisation suggests that its adoption is still very low but appears to be growing. As such, tokenisation could have implications for financial stability if it scales up significantly, is used to create complex and opaque automated trading products, or if identified vulnerabilities are not adequately addressed through oversight, regulation, supervision, and enforcement. The report sets out some considerations for authorities and international bodies, including ways to address data and information gaps and to increase understanding of how tokenisation and its related features fit into legal and regulatory frameworks and supervisory approaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/g20-crypto-asset-policy-implementation-roadmap-status-report/">The status report on the G20 Crypto-Asset Policy Implementation Roadmap</a>. Jurisdictions have made progress implementing the policy and regulatory responses to crypto-assets developed by the IMF, FSB, and standard-setting bodies (SSBs). The report flags some implementation challenges related to the lack of comprehensive regulation of crypto-asset issuers and service providers; cross-border issues, particularly with respect to offshore jurisdictions; and the lack of specific stablecoin regulatory requirements. The report calls on authorities to advance the implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s crypto-asset framework, globally. It warns that the prevalence of non-compliance with existing laws and regulations significantly undermines these efforts to implement the FSB framework. Additionally, if risks from cross-border crypto-asset activities in offshore jurisdictions increase, international organisations, SSBs and jurisdictional authorities may need to consider additional tools to promote implementation beyond G20 members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other reports being delivered to the G20 meeting include a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/format-for-incident-reporting-exchange-fire-consultation-report/">consultation on a common Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE)</a>; p<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2024/">rogress reports on the G20 Cross-Border Payments Roadmap</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/annual-progress-report-on-meeting-the-targets-for-cross-border-payments-2024-report-on-key-performance-indicators/">associated indicators, which capture key aspects of the user experience</a>;<em>&nbsp;</em>and a report on depositor behaviour and interest rate and liquidity risks in the financial system, drawing on lessons from the March 2023 banking turmoil.</p>
<p>The letter underlines the critical importance of effective and timely implementation of&nbsp;<a>agreed&nbsp;</a>policies and standards in the interest of global financial stability.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB report defines &ldquo;tokenisation&rdquo; as a process that involves utilising new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology, to issue or represent assets in digital forms known as tokens. The report focuses on tokenisation involving financial assets.</p>
<p>In September 2023, the G20 Leaders endorsed the Crypto-Asset Policy Implementation Roadmap, which is included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/09/imf-fsb-synthesis-paper-policies-for-crypto-assets/">IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper: Policies for Crypto-Assets</a>&nbsp;and lays out both planned and ongoing initiatives by the IMF, the FSB, and relevant SSBs.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div> resilient, global economy, economic growth, unemployment, U.S. economic performance 
Summary:<br />Secretary Yellen discusses global economic resilience, U.S. economic strength, low unemployment, and rejection of isolationism for global economic leadership. <div>
<p><span>Today</span><span face="times new roman,times" size="3"><span>, at 10:30 AM, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen will hold a press conference at the Treasury Department, where she will deliver remarks on her key priorities for the 2024 Annual Meetings.&nbsp;</span>A livestream of Secretary Yellen&rsquo;s remarks will be available&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://links-2.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fc%2FUSTreasGov/1/01010192b46249b5-2775387a-d77d-4c11-a88f-fc1efc6bb014-000000/EVG9x-96SeRCAuVxkd7bMMjo5kfm5L5gjMRVPvNCv9k=375" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</span><span face="times new roman,times" size="3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times" size="3">The following are excerpts from the Secretary&rsquo;s remarks as prepared for delivery:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times" size="3">&ldquo;Let me thank the IMF and the World Bank for hosting these meetings and all of you for attending today.</span></p>
<p><span face="times new roman,times" size="3">I&rsquo;d like to start by stepping back and speaking about how far we&rsquo;ve come. Three years ago when I attended my first Annual Meetings as Treasury Secretary, the COVID-19 pandemic was raging. Many of the events were virtual. The IMF had just revised downward its projections for global economic growth due to continued supply chain disruptions and new COVID variants.</span><br /><br /><span face="times new roman,times" size="3">Today, the situation is very different. Though progress across economies has been uneven, the global economy has proven resilient. America&rsquo;s strong economic performance is leading the way as a key engine of global growth. At home, thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s economic agenda, we went from millions having lost their jobs to a historic labor market recovery. Unemployment is near all-time lows and U.S. real wage growth has outperformed that of most other advanced economies. U.S. economic growth has also been almost twice as fast as most other advanced economies this year and last, even as inflation came down sooner. As a recent Brookings analysis puts it, &ldquo;the U.S. is significantly outperforming its peers.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re now working to sustain this momentum, including through major investments in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy that other countries have sought to emulate. This morning the IMF again upgraded its forecast for the U.S. outlook, as it did in 2023, when U.S. growth ultimately came in at almost double the IMF&rsquo;s projection earlier that year.</span><br /><br /><span face="times new roman,times" size="3">Our Administration has also been focused beyond our borders. From day one, we rejected isolationism that made America and the world worse off and pursued global economic leadership that supports economies around the world and brings significant benefits to the American people and the U.S. economy.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>Leading Financial Institutions Tackle Unstructured Data Challenges With AI-Powered Technology</title>

<div> initiative, unstructured data, financial industry, AI, blockchain technology
<br />
Chainlink's initiative with industry leaders aims to address unstructured financial data, using AI and blockchain to create a unified, reliable source. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><i>American Technology company Chainlink has launched an industry initative to address the persistent issue of unstructured data in the financial industry. The initiative brings together leading financial market infrastructures Euroclear, Swift, and some of the world&rsquo;s largest financial institutions Citi, UBS, Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, Caceis, Vontobel, and Sygnum Bank.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p>The initiative aims to leverage advancements in AI, oracles, and blockchain technology to solve the long-standing problem of real-time standardised data in fragmented markets like Europe. Today, Chainlink, in collaboration with financial markets infrastructures Euroclear and Swift, as well as several major financial institutions, has released a <b>report</b> detailing the results.</p>
<p>Corporate actions, such as dividend payments and stock splits, represent one of the most complex unstructured data challenges in the financial world. Data from these actions travels through various intermediaries, including the company behind the stock, custodians, brokers, fund managers, exchanges, before reaching investors. This journey can result in data inconsistencies, varying formats, and inefficiencies, costing the financial market approximately USD 3-5 million annually, with 75% of firms manually revalidating custodian and exchange data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainlink&rsquo;s solution addresses the need for accurate, machine-readable data. The new system architecture employs large language models (LLMs) and decentralised oracle networks to autonomously extract and standardise unstructured data from issuers and publish it onchain. This blockchain-agnostic strategy leads to a unified &ldquo;golden record&rdquo; that serves as a single data source of truth for all market participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with ecosystem partners Hyperledger Besu, Avalanche, and ZKsync, the iniative has successfully demonstrated how decentralised oracles, combined with LLMs (using Chat GPT, Google&rsquo;s Gemini and Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) can source, validate and convert unstructured and often unreachable offchain data into digital data available in near real-time across public and private blockchain networks, compatible with existing financial systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the focus is now on corporate actions as the first use case, unified golden records can also be applied to other areas, such as private assets valuation, risk management data, legal identifiers, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink</b>: &ldquo;<i>The combination of AI and oracles is a powerful tool for taking corporate actions data and turning it to highly reliably structured data. Turning various pieces of disconnected corporate actions data into unified golden records that can then be relied on by hundreds of market participants as a definitive, golden source of truth is a huge step forward in how financial markets deal with critical and error-prone data. Solving this problem allows asset managers, banks, and financial market infrastructures to all be in sync much faster than today, at a fraction of the cost and with a massive reduction in costly errors that affect the financial system.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p><b>St&eacute;phanie Lheureux, Director Digital Assets Competence Centre at Euroclear</b>: &ldquo;<i>By collaborating across the industry and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we can address major pain points and redesign workflows for greater efficiency, transparency and value. Proper co-creation and implementation of AI and Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) can amplify each other&rsquo;s strengths, creating golden records accessible to all in real time and paving the way for transformative solutions.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Mark Garabedian, Director Digital Assets and Tokenisation Strategy at Wellington Management</b>: &ldquo;<i>The complexity of&nbsp; corporate actions is a relevant and appropriate use case for the convergence of AI, oracles, and blockchain technology. By leveraging AI and Chainlink oracles to interpret, standardize, and deliver high-value unstructured data, we can dramatically reduce the manual processes required, enabling significant potential operational efficiency and cost reduction while ensuring that data flows through the system with the required levels of accuracy and transparency.</i>&rdquo;</p>

Summary:
FCA targets finfluencers promoting financial products illegally, interviews 20 under caution. Influencers trusted by young audience, warned to check products. Consumers advised to check FCA's warning list. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p align="left"><span>20 finfluencers are being interviewed under caution by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), as it launches targeted action against finfluencers who may be touting financial services products illegally.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA also</span><span>&nbsp;issued 38 alerts against social media accounts operated by finfluencers which may contain unlawful promotions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>Increasing numbers of young people are falling victim to scams, and finfluencers can often play a part. Nearly two-thirds (62%) of 18- to 29-year-olds follow social media influencers, 74% of those said they trusted their advice and 9 in 10 young followers have been encouraged to change their financial behaviour.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>ACER’s Monitoring Shows European Gas Markets Avoided Severe Gas Price Volatility In The Third Quarter Of 2024</title>

<div> supply uncertainty, gas prices, price integration, renewables, gas demand <br />
Summary: 
European gas prices remained stable due to increased Norwegian supply and low demand. However, rising gas transport tariffs and expiring Russian gas transit agreement pose challenges. <br /> <div>
<p>Today, ACER releases its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGAg5UAgJQUkwNAlZXHVZaV1MdCwsBUhoGVAEHBQJTAgMFVFQdVFEFUQgCAFsdBA1TUB0GAAIHGlRWUQMZCgcOAQACUlFRAFZURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">third quarterly review of key developments in European gas wholesale markets</a>&nbsp;as part of its 2024 Market Monitoring Report (MMR). The first and second publication were issued respectively in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBUgVTB1cCAkxbUANRHVYLBQ4dUwkFVBoGUAZSAlAHUgcBBVcdVFEFUQgCAFsdBA1TUB0GAAIHGlRWUQMZCgcOAQACUlFRAFZURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">March</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBUlVVB1UHVEwPVQRSHVYNBwUdUwBQVRoABwtVUAQGDlMBVQYdVFEFUQgCAFsdBA1TUB0GAAIHGlRWUQMZCgcOAQACUlFRAFZURQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">July</a>&nbsp;2024.</p>
<p>The report finds that despite supply uncertainty re-emerging, Europe avoided severe gas price volatility in Q3 2024. What&rsquo;s novel in this quarterly edition is the new focus on the evolution of cross-border gas transport tariffs, which have been rising in recent years.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas prices:&nbsp;</strong>In Q3 2024, European gas wholesale prices rose but remained less volatile than last year due to increased Norwegian supply, healthy storage levels, and low demand.</li>
<li><strong>Price integration:</strong>&nbsp;Price integration across most EU gas hubs remained consistent, although some divergence occurred due to the rising German storage levy.</li>
<li><strong>Gas demand:&nbsp;</strong>Stagnant household demand and a modest increase in industrial demand were outweighed by a reduced call on gas-fired electricity generation, leaving overall EU gas demand slightly lower than in 2023 and well below pre-crisis levels.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables continue to displace gas generation</strong>: Increased renewables&rsquo; output limited the opportunities for conventional power plants (gas and coal) to run profitably. This lowered carbon emissions, loosened the EU gas demand-supply balance and reduced instances of gas setting marginal prices in electricity markets.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;The EU reached its 90% gas storage target ahead of schedule,&nbsp;despite lower year-on-year injections throughout the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission tariffs:&nbsp;</strong>Gas transmission tariffs have been rising in some EU countries, with little evidence so far of impacting price convergence. More tariff increases are expected in the near-term, warranting monitoring of the effects of tariff changes on cross-border trade and market integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What challenges lie ahead?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The Russian gas transit agreement through Ukraine expires in 2024, pushing Central Europe to seek alternative supply routes.</li>
<li>If gas withdrawals this winter significantly exceed the previous years, the EU may face increased competition in LNG markets for 2025, potentially driving up wholesale gas prices.</li>
<li>Several LNG production projects are under construction, but major new LNG volumes are expected only from 2026 onwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER will continue to closely monitor trends in the European gas markets that could lead to short-term volatility for European energy markets. The next update&nbsp;will be published early in 2025.</p>

<title>OptAxe Launches Multilateral Trading Facility For FX Options</title>

<div> Authorised, FCA, OptAxe, FX options, trading venue
Summary:<br /><br />OptAxe, authorised by FCA, centralises FX options liquidity for efficient, risk-recycling trading, using innovative automated approach, improving market intelligence. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Authorised by the FCA, OptAxe is a regulated trading venue that centralises FX options liquidity to increase trading opportunities&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Brings a&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>new approach to axe-driven FX options trading that applies innovation to position/price distribution, discovery and execution</span></span></span></li>
<li><span>Improves efficiency, enables risk recycling and advances market intelligence for both market makers and market takers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>OptAxe, a&nbsp;<span>fully centralised trading venue for liquidity discovery, dissemination and execution,&nbsp;</span>today announced it has received FCA authorisation to operate a multilateral trading facility (MTF) for axe-driven FX options trading.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>OptAxe was launched to address fundamental shortcomings in FX options trading. OTC FX markets today lack pricing transparency and bilateral, manual processes often lead to missed trading opportunities. The absence of centralised information prevents full visibility of axe inventory, hinders the ability to benchmark options executions, and risks information leakage.</span></p>
<p><span>At present, FX options trading is still largely a voice-driven market and OptAxe analysis suggests that only 25% of bank-to-client axes are distributed successfully via traditional channels.&nbsp;Coupled with prevailing practices of dispersed, multi-pod portfolio management models, diminishing numbers of interbank counterparties and the rise of multiple electronic communication networks (ECNs) and platforms, FX trading has become significantly fragmented. This fragmentation now presents substantial position distribution and coverage challenges, and places constraints on effective price discovery and execution options.</span></p>
<p><span>What&rsquo;s more, Uncleared Margin Rules [UMR], and regulatory obligations mandating Initial Margining for all trades, have exponentially raised the cost of running FX options businesses, with bilateral trading margin requirements heavily impacting balance sheets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>OptAxe offers an innovative and automated approach to FX options trading that digitises and centralises the distribution of FX options axes.&nbsp;</strong>OptAxe evolves the current model by&nbsp;providing market participants with a solution that sources and consolidates the best interest available in the market, in real-time.&nbsp;OptAxe aggregates axe inventory into a single platform, effectively acting as a multi-issuer venue rather than a multi-dealer platform, with RFQ and counterparty disclosure at the point of execution.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Chris Jackson, CEO and Co-Founder of OptAxe, said</strong>:&nbsp;&ldquo;We set out to bring much-needed innovation to the FX options market, improve liquidity discovery<span>&nbsp;and unlock previously untapped trading opportunities.&nbsp;</span>OptAxe is a<span>&nbsp;fully centralised, regulated venue for liquidity discovery, dissemination and execution that empowers trading participants with actionable insights from centralised liquidity information. We automate manual, bilateral processes and consolidate available axe inventory into a single platform, effectively acting as a multi-issuer, not a multi-dealer platform, RFQ-based venue&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Yorke O&rsquo;Leary, COO and Co-Founder of OptAxe, added:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Securing FCA approval to operate a regulated MTF for FX options trading is a significant milestone for OptAxe and represents a step-change in how the industry operates. Globally, capital costs are rising and market participants urgently need to access, recycle and clear more FX options risk, whilst still facing inefficient distribution practices, complex price discovery methods and expensive execution outcomes. With OptAxe, all market participants can easily access a centralised source of actionable axe inventory with evidence-based pricing that meets the demands of the trading community today and tomorrow.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;With the overall size of the FX options market estimated to be approx $300bn per day, any improvement in the current distribution, and hence execution success rate will be transformative&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA authorisation follows a rigorous, two-year process from participating in the FCA&rsquo;s Pathway Programme to gaining a full trading venue licence, compliant with all the regulatory obligations of an MTF, from operational resilience to surveillance, trade reporting and regulatory data reporting.</span></p>
<p><span>OptAxe&rsquo;s platform is ready to use. All necessary technical development, connectivity and integration work is complete.&nbsp;OptAxe provides a range of connectivity options via Web GUI and a variety of APIs, including FIX and REST, that open access to sources of available liquidity. Automated price and execution options&nbsp;<span>offer improved trading fulfilment control, expanded counterparty opportunities and better execution analysis to all market participants.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<div> Transformation, ASIC, regulatory outcomes, consumer protection, enforcement
Summary:<br />ASIC achieved regulatory and enforcement firsts, increased investigations and civil proceedings, and protected consumers from scams and phishing websites. <div>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s program of transformation continued in 2023&ndash;24, according to the agency&rsquo;s latest annual report.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the report highlighted a range of key regulatory and enforcement outcomes focused on protecting consumers, reducing costs for businesses, and strengthening capabilities.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have made significant progress with the program of transformation work we began three years ago,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>Following ASIC&rsquo;s most significant organisational redesign in 15 years, better collaboration, enhanced systems and strengthened capabilities have delivered a number of important outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory and enforcement firsts:</strong>&nbsp;ASIC achieved several regulatory and enforcement firsts, including the first win in a greenwashing civil penalty action, the first stop order on a life insurance product, and the first infringement notice issued to a market operator, the ASX.</li>
<li><strong>Strong compliance and enforcement outcomes:</strong>&nbsp;In 2023&ndash;24, ASIC commenced around 170 new investigations, an increase of about 25% on the previous year. The agency also increased its new civil proceedings by 23%.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer</strong><strong>&nbsp;protection:</strong>&nbsp;ASIC took down more than 7,300 investment scams and phishing websites, protecting Australians from losing their savings to scammers. The ASIC Moneysmart website was used by over 11 million Australians. More than 6 million people made use of the free tools and calculators to help manage their finances.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;We are seeing the benefits of our transformation work as an agency,&rsquo; said Mr Longo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Change and transformation also naturally lead to disruption and we acknowledge there are areas we can continue to improve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is always more to be done to keep delivering for consumers, businesses, and the community we serve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have seen a number of changes in ASIC&rsquo;s executive leadership team over the last year, which means we are well positioned to meet the challenges and opportunities the agency faces.</p>
<p>'We will continue to evolve and respond to new challenges in our operating environment and to the threats and harms that emerge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ka huri au ki te reo Ingarangi&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kia ora and thank you for inviting me to speak here today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this is my very first Financial Services Federation conference, I thought it would be appropriate to introduce myself, as I have done in my mihi. My story is that of a child born in the UK whose family moved to Christchurch when I was young.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I have pursued my career and had my family in the UK and Europe for the past 20 odd years, I returned to New Zealand in 2022, to take up the role of Chief Executive of the Financial Markets Authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is never a dull moment being head of a financial regulator, not least because of the degree of regulatory change that the sector has experienced in recent years. For the FMA, our remit has expanded, and is expanding, considerably. This includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the introduction of the new financial advice regime in 2019,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>implementation of climate related disclosures standards,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>conduct of financial institutions legislation coming into force early next year,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the Contracts of Insurance Bill just out of Select Committee,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and of course, the transfer of responsibility for credit law shifting from the Commerce Commission to the FMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Amidst all this change, it is good to be here as part of the FMA&rsquo;s growing relationship with non-bank lenders and finance companies. Of course, this is a relationship that will be an increasingly important one once we formally hold responsibility for the CCCFA. In preparation for this, you will have seen engagement between the FMA and your industry body step up this year. This engagement is part of our desire to develop a solid, enduring relationship with the FSF and you, its members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I am preaching to the converted when I say that the financial services sector plays a critical role in enabling New Zealanders&rsquo; lives. Lending, and the work you do, is indeed a key component of this, enabling New Zealanders to borrow for the things they value, such as buying a car or a house, or for other important things that they need in their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As lenders, you help make that happen. Our role, as a conduct regulator, will be to ensure customers are treated responsibly and that financial service providers act with integrity in that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I go further, it is important to make clear that the changes recently announced by Minister Bayly will require legislation, and this has yet to be introduced into Parliament. The select committee process will allow the sector and members of the public to tell lawmakers what they think of the legislation. These are matters and decisions for these lawmakers and for Ministers. Our role will be to implement whatever is passed into law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And until the law is passed and comes into force, the Commerce Commission remains the regulator for the CCCFA. While you are seeing the FMA in more engagement activities organised by the Commission, and we are now working closely with the Commission in many ways to ensure a smooth and effective transfer, you should continue to engage with the Commission as normal until the transfer officially takes effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the policy and legislative process is still in train, and we are a wee way off the implementation phase of the CCCFA transfer, I thought I would take this opportunity to introduce you to the FMA and describe what you might expect from us as a regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is a relatively young regulator but created following longstanding issues that came to a head during the Global Financial Crisis. Those in the sector at the time will have been acutely aware of the effects of the finance company collapses, with the risks and harms exposed, unmitigated by market forces. These conditions created a powerful argument for regulation to support Mum and Dad investors and quality capital markets in New Zealand. The FMA was created out of those ashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, the CCCFA transfer is not simply about moving around the deck chairs. I believe, and hope, that having a single conduct regulator for the financial markets will simplify the regulatory landscape across the sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a conduct regulator, we hold a different set of regulatory tools compared to the Commission&rsquo;s role as a competition and consumer regulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Markets Conduct Act, alongside other laws, gives us a broad toolkit, which allows us to provide flexible and proportionate regulation of firms within our remit. This includes providers of financial advice, registered banks, non-bank deposit takers, insurers, and soon, of course, non-bank lenders and finance companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Minister has already signalled that a market services licence will replace the certification regime as part of the CCCFA transfer. Legislation is intended to provide that firms who are certified will automatically be deemed to hold this new licence when the law comes into force.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put simply, the aim is to lift and shift certified firms to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance costs from the outset and ensure a smooth transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what does it mean to be licensed and supervised by the FMA?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our engagement with firms, our overall approach is to build a greater understanding of why firms do what they do.&nbsp;If we start with our licensing model, this normally involves assessing applications from market participants who want to carry out certain activities, such as providing financial advice, or operating as an insurer or deposit taker. With the transfer of the CCCFA, there will however be no application or assessment in order to support a seamless transition between regulatory models. Unlike certification, licences do not expire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The duties and obligations firms will have are those that already exist under the CCCFA, such as being a responsible lender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA supervises licensed firms in line with our overarching statutory objective to promote and facilitate the development of fair, efficient and transparent markets. This will also extend to the CCCFA&rsquo;s primary purpose of consumer protection. Our supervision activity &ndash; where we monitor adherence to regulatory and legislative requirements by financial market participants &ndash; is integral to this outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of supervision as an enhanced relationship with the regulator. It&rsquo;s fluid and proactive, and forms part of our engagement-led approach. We are here to assist and guide, not just enforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation of the new financial advice regime is a good example of this. The Monitoring Insights Report for Financial Advice Providers we released earlier this year reflects the output from our supervisory work with the advice sector. In practice, this work involves things like recurring meetings, desk based and onsite reviews, and studies looking at a single issue across multiple firms, which we call thematic reviews. Throughout these activities, our focus is on identifying, monitoring and assessing any opportunities, risks and gaps related to our shared objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more targeted form of engagement is the monitoring we undertake on key aspects of compliance and risk. This involves reviewing and assessing the compliance, competency and conduct of financial market participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take a risk-based approach, which means we focus our activity where we have the greatest opportunity of reducing harm to investors and consumers. This means we actively focus on only a portion of our regulated population in any given year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An engagement-led approach means that we look to build solid, long-lasting relationships with firms and the industry bodies that represent them. A good example of this is the work we&rsquo;ve done, particularly with smaller deposit takers, to help them prepare for the new Conduct of Financial Institutions regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be one on one engagement with firms, but it can also include speeches like this one, as well as industry roundtables on themes we have picked up on across the industry, such as the use of artificial intelligence in financial services, or consumer and industry perceptions of fairness in anticipation of our conduct regime coming into force next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, in order to build enduring relationships, we need an industry body that has the support and the financial backing of its members. A properly resourced industry body pays dividends when it comes to ensuring the views and needs of firms are appropriately reflected in our regulatory approach, such as in the course of issuing guidance, or when we discuss the practical implications of policy and legislative changes with key decision makers. I encourage you to work with and through your industry body to get the most out of the FMA&rsquo;s engagement-led approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An engagement-led approach is clearly important to us and a part of how we like to show up as a regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that to work well it needs to be complemented by a clear understanding that we also use the range of enforcement tools available to us when necessary. This includes taking regulatory action (such as public warnings, direction orders and stop orders) in relation to non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to emphasise here that our action will be proportionate to the misconduct to achieve an appropriate market outcome or change in behaviour. In the event of market misconduct, we may intervene on an informal basis or at a low level. However, we will also take strong action and hold individuals and entities accountable when they break the law and fail to meet the standards that are expected of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is one message I want you to take away from what our supervisory approach will look like, it is that being licenced is an ongoing and enduring relationship between the regulator and the regulated entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the spirit of understanding our &lsquo;why&rsquo;, I want to describe my personal view of why we do what we do. The FMA, and I, are incredibly focused on regulation that genuinely matters and delivers for New Zealanders. My underlying philosophy is that we cannot simply regulate for the sake of regulating. Regulation needs to pass the &lsquo;so what&rsquo; test, as well as enable innovation. By keeping an eye on unnecessary regulatory burden, we can ensure our regulatory approach is achieving the outcomes we, and New Zealanders, expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we want to ensure the FMA&rsquo;s focus is not just on compliance but on what we are actually trying to achieve. That is the ultimate way in which we will deliver well focused regulation, keep costs down and make sure we are not unnecessarily cutting across innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I draw to a close, I want to acknowledge some of the positive interactions with your sector to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Services Federation&rsquo;s engagement with the Council of Financial Regulators, or CoFR, has been helpful for us as we start turning our minds to our incoming credit responsibilities. These engagements help us better understand your priorities and also your concerns, especially during this period of significant regulatory change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to take a moment to acknowledge the work I understand is being done to build on relations between lenders and the financial mentoring sector. These consumer groups will become increasingly important to us as we move closer to the CCCFA transfer, so it is good to see growing engagement in this space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set out in my remarks the approach you can expect from the FMA in the years ahead. It&rsquo;s also inevitably going to be the case that there will be times in the years ahead where the FMA and the industry will not agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to be expected. But while we may not always agree, having an avenue for dialogue is an essential foundation for constructive discussions for the benefit of New Zealanders who need to borrow for the important things in life. Our relationship endures beyond times of agreement and disagreement. Our doors will always be open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on that note, I want to say thank you again for having me at your conference, to open this dialogue.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m looking forward to engaging further with you in the months and years to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you and I welcome any questions you may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm Wisdomtree With Failing To Adhere To Its Own Investment Criteria For ESG-Marketed Funds - Firm Misstated That Funds Did Not Invest In Companies Involved In Fossil Fuels And Tobacco</title>

<div> SEC, WisdomTree, ESG, investment, misstatements <br />
WisdomTree charged for misrepresenting ESG investment strategy, investing in prohibited activities, and lacking screening process, consenting to penalties. <br />
Summary:<br />
- WisdomTree charged for misrepresenting ESG investment strategy
- Invested in prohibited activities
- Lacked screening process
- Consented to penalties <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged New York-based investment adviser WisdomTree Asset Management Inc. with making misstatements and for compliance failures relating to the execution of an investment strategy that was marketed as incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from March 2020 until November 2022, WisdomTree represented in prospectuses for three ESG-marketed exchange-traded funds, and to the board of trustees overseeing the funds, that the funds would not invest in companies involved in certain products or activities, including fossil fuels and tobacco. However, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds that the ESG-marketed funds invested in companies that were involved in fossil fuels and tobacco, including in coal mining and transportation, natural gas extraction and distribution, and retail sales of tobacco products. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, WisdomTree used data from third-party vendors that did not screen out all companies involved in fossil fuel and tobacco-related activities. The SEC&rsquo;s order further finds that WisdomTree did not have any policies and procedures over the screening process to exclude such companies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a fundamental level, the federal securities laws enforce a straightforward proposition: investment advisers must do what they say and say what they do,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;When investment advisers represent that they will follow particular investment criteria, whether that is investing in, or refraining from investing in, companies involved in certain activities, they have to adhere to that criteria and appropriately disclose any limitations or exceptions to such criteria. By contrast, the funds at issue in today&rsquo;s enforcement action made precisely the types of investments that investors would not have expected them to based on WisdomTree&rsquo;s disclosures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WisdomTree consented to the entry of the SEC&rsquo;s order finding that it violated the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the compliance rule in the Investment Advisers Act. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, WisdomTree agreed to a cease-and-desist order and censure and to pay a $4 million civil penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Salvatore Massa and Joshua Tannen, and was supervised by Lee A. Greenwood, Andrew Dean, and Corey Schuster, all from the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. Russell Feldman and Daniel Loss of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s New York Regional Office provided assistance in the matter. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Arjuman Sultana, Majid S. Mahmood, Lev Miller, and Margaret Pottanat of the Division of Examinations.</p>

<div> revisions, recovery planning guidelines, large banks, testing standard, non-financial risk
Summary:<br />
Revisions to OCC's recovery planning guidelines now apply to banks with at least $100 billion in assets, with a testing standard and clarified role of non-financial risk. Compliance dates are staggered.<br /> <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today finalized revisions to its recovery planning guidelines for certain large insured national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches (banks).</p>
<p>The revisions to the recovery planning guidelines are part of the OCC&rsquo;s effort to ensure that large banks are adequately prepared for and have developed plans to respond to the financial effects of severe stress, particularly in light of the contagion effects and systemic risks they may pose.</p>
<p>The revisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>expand the recovery planning guidelines to apply to banks with at least $100 billion in assets;</li>
<li>incorporate a testing standard for recovery plans;</li>
<li>clarify the role of non-financial risk (including operational and strategic risk) in recovery planning; and</li>
<li>in response to comments, provide covered banks with timeframes in which to comply with the recovery planning guidelines, including development of a testing framework and conducting testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The revisions are effective on January 1, 2025, with staggered compliance dates.</p>

<p>Good morning. Thank you, Ken, for the kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Nearly four years ago, Jen Psaki was freshly in her White House press secretary job when she had to answer questions about the GameStop fallout from the podium.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;A few months later, my first testimony as SEC Chair was centered on those events.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>What GameStop put on display was how much has changed&mdash;in technology and business models&mdash;since 2005 when we last comprehensively updated our equity market rules.</p>
<p>The markets have moved to overwhelmingly trade electronically, with transaction volume in listed equities tripling in the last 17 years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A large and growing portion of the market is being transacted off-exchange in the dark markets. As of 2023, approximately 45 percent of share volume was executed in the dark markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;up from 25 percent in 2009.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Further, there has been a significant increase in everyday investor participation in the markets. About 58 percent of American households directly or indirectly own stocks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The $55 trillion U.S. equity markets are critical to American families saving for their future. They are critical to capital formation, job creation, innovation, and the overall economy. We have the deepest, most liquid markets in the world. I&rsquo;d note for comparison purposes, our markets have individual stocks whose market cap is greater than the aggregate market cap of many of the leading economies in Europe.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>We cannot, though, take our capital market leadership for granted. As I&rsquo;m sure the athletes who competed in Paris would agree, even a gold medalist must keep training.</p>
<p>We at the SEC have a duty to investors and issuers alike to regularly update our rules to drive greater efficiency and resiliency in the markets&mdash;to continue to look for ways to lower cost and lower risk.</p>
<p>That is in essence what SEC staff said three years ago when they issued the GameStop Report.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;That report identified four areas for the Commission&rsquo;s consideration for possible reforms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>So, where are we today? Let&rsquo;s start with equity market structure, and then I will discuss where we are on central clearing, short selling, and digital engagement practices.</p>
<h2>Equity Market Structure</h2>
<p>Last month, the Commission unanimously approved the most important updates to the equity markets since 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Earlier this year, the Commission also unanimously adopted final rules to enhance disclosure requirements for order execution quality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>These rules will help drive greater efficiency, competition, and fairness.</p>
<p>When I started on Wall Street, markets were quoted in fractions of dollars as they had been all the way back to the 18th century. By the 1990s, though stock exchanges had shifted their rules to allow quotes in sixteenths of a dollar, investors were clamoring for lower quote increments. Such wide spreads may have benefited brokers and dealers, but investors benefit when quoted spreads are tighter.</p>
<p>Thus, in 2000, the SEC required the exchanges to move to decimalization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Market participants would be allowed to decide a minimum quote as long as it was in decimals. Ken, you may recall from your early days in Congress the Common Cents Stock Pricing Act of 1997.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;I know, though, that same year you were pretty busy with the Balanced Budget Act.</p>
<p>Later, in 2004, when proposing equity market reforms, the SEC observed that while the benefits justified decimal pricing, there were potential costs when some market participants use de minimis quotes. Thus, Regulation NMS, adopted in 2005, included the so-called &ldquo;sub-penny rule&rdquo; setting a minimum quotation increment of one penny.</p>
<p>Given how much has changed since 2005, I think it was incumbent upon us to update our national market system rules.</p>
<p>First, it was time to relax that one-penny minimum quotation increment, which had become outdated and too wide for many stocks in today&rsquo;s markets. Stocks representing approximately 74 percent of share volume are currently being quoted at less than 1.5 pennies. This compares to 2005 when 54 percent of stocks traded at less than 1.5 pennies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>For many stocks, under the updated rule, the new minimum will be half a penny. Reducing what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;tick size&rdquo; will benefit investors and market participants by allowing stocks to be priced more efficiently and competitively.</p>
<p>Second, over the years, the Commission has received many requests to lower the cap that exchanges could charge for access to both address market distortions and reflect changes in the market since 2005.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;In light of relaxing the minimum for quoting increments, it also was appropriate at this time to lower the maximum fee that can be charged for access. The Commission&rsquo;s updated rule lowers the cap from three-tenths of a penny to one-tenth of a penny. It also ensures that traders can determine, at the time of executing a trade, any rebates of the access fee that may be paid to them on that trade.</p>
<p>Third, the rules implement an updated definition of a round lot, which had been 120 years old, to be tiered depending upon the price of a share. This matters because, under current rules, only trades in round lots are covered by the Order Protection Rule<i>.</i><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Further, it will bring more round lot quotes into the important measuring stick, the National Best Bid and Offer, leading investors potentially to benefit from better pricing. At 100 shares, it no longer reflected today&rsquo;s markets, particularly given the high prices at which many stocks trade. The updated rules also will provide investors greater transparency on quotes for orders smaller than a round lot (so-called &ldquo;odd lots&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Regarding disclosure of order execution quality, this past March the Commission updated a 24-year-old rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Rule 605, which the Commission first adopted in 2000, required monthly disclosures on execution quality from market participants known as market centers.</p>
<p>The updates to Rule 605 require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public. Along with enhancements to both data and readability, these reforms will improve transparency for execution quality and facilitate investors&rsquo; ability to compare brokers, thereby enhancing competition in our markets.</p>
<p>The Commission also has proposed rules regarding best execution,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;order competition,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;and exchanges&rsquo; volume-based transaction rebates and fees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback on these proposals and are considering all of the comments.</p>
<h2>Clearing</h2>
<p>GameStop was a real-world example that the market plumbing of clearing and settling transactions matters.</p>
<p>Rapidly changing prices led a number of brokers to restrict additional buying activity by their customers due to the clearinghouse making larger than usual margin calls. Many everyday investors lost access to the market at a critical time.</p>
<p>The longer it takes for a trade to settle&mdash;the slower the plumbing&mdash;the more risk our markets assume and the more risk fundamentally that we all assume.</p>
<p>As a result of these events, market participants of all stripes called for shortening the settlement cycle.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>On May 28, 2024, we achieved this. The equities, corporate bonds, and municipal markets successfully moved to T+1 (aligning with the Treasury markets, which had already been at T+1). Further, market participants are now required to confirm, affirm, and allocate their trades as soon as technologically practicable on the same day as the trade.</p>
<p>Market participants, including many of you in this room&mdash;from the clearinghouses, depositories, custodian banks, broker-dealers, investment advisers, self-regulatory organizations, stock exchanges, service providers, and industry groups&mdash;worked, along with SEC staff, to make the transition happen smoothly.</p>
<p>For everyday investors, this means you now can sell your stock on a Monday and get your cash on a Tuesday. This makes a real difference&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to wait until Wednesday. With 58 percent of American households holding stocks, this is significant.</p>
<p>Cutting the clearance and settlement cycle in half also reduces the amount of margin, or collateral, that must be placed with the clearinghouse. The way the math works it&rsquo;s likely to average 29 percent savings over time. First indications reported by the clearinghouse show a savings of 23 percent, or about $3 billion, resulting from the move to T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Shortening the matching process of clearing (the time to ensure that all parties confirm, affirm, and allocate the trade details) also lowers operational as well as counterparty risk.</p>
<p>Since implementation, market participants have been affirming nearly 95 percent of transactions by the 9 p.m. ET cutoff on trade date, significantly higher affirmation rates than in a T+2 environment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<h2>Transparency of Short Selling and Securities Lending</h2>
<p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress directed the SEC to enhance the transparency of two separate areas: short selling of equity securities<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;as well as securities lending.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The staff&rsquo;s GameStop report also noted that increased transparency regarding short selling should be considered.</p>
<p>Thus, in October 2023, we adopted a rule that broadens the scope of short sale-related data available to regulators and the investing public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>The short sale rules will promote greater transparency about short positions both to regulators and the public. Investment managers will report to the Commission, and an aggregated, anonymized version of that information will be disclosed to the public with a delay.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p>Given past market events, it&rsquo;s important for the Commission and the public to know more about large short positions in the equity markets, especially in times of stress or volatility.</p>
<p>Also in October 2023, we adopted a rule to bring greater transparency and efficiency to the securities lending market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p>The more than $3 trillion securities lending market can help investment funds, endowments, and pension funds generate additional revenue. This market, though, is opaque. The public often cannot access data about it unless they purchase a subscription.</p>
<p>In fulfilling Congress&rsquo;s mandates with regard to the transparency of short selling and securities lending, these rules will help ensure regulators and market participants benefit from this comprehensive and timely information.</p>
<h2>Digital Engagement Practices</h2>
<p>The GameStop events nearly four years ago also highlighted the use of behavioral prompts and nudges, such as those that had game-like features and celebratory animations. The staff said consideration should be given to whether such prompts are likely intended to lead investors to trade more than they would otherwise.</p>
<p>One of the great transformations of the last 20 years is that now people can trade stocks and get investment advice a click away in their apps. This widens access to the markets and lowers costs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also seen brokerages and investment advisers use sophisticated analytic tools to interact with investors. We&rsquo;re used to this from other parts of our lives, whether it&rsquo;s the movie streaming platforms, online shopping pushes, or other forms of narrowcasting that give us individual nudges.</p>
<p>Yet when it comes to brokers and investment advisers, are their algorithms optimizing just for the customer or also for the broker or adviser&rsquo;s interests? Broker-dealers and investment advisers, regardless of whether they are interacting with customers the old-fashioned way with human thought or with algorithms, need to ensure they are not putting their own interest ahead of the interest of their customers.</p>
<p>Thus, after the GameStop report in the fall of 2021, we put out a request for comment on digital engagement practices. If the optimization function in the AI system is taking the interest of the platform into consideration as well as the interest of the customer, this can lead to conflicts of interest. We then proposed a rule in July 2023 regarding the use of predictive data analytics.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-sifma-102124#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve received a lot of feedback from the public on this proposal. As I&rsquo;ve done from time to time with other rules, I&rsquo;ve asked staff to consider whether it would be appropriate to seek further comment, possibly, on a modified proposal.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude where I started. We have the deepest, most liquid equity markets in the world. These $55 trillion markets are critical for families investing for their future. They are critical to capital formation, job creation, innovation, and the overall economy.</p>
<p>As we were so keenly reminded, though, with the GameStop events nearly four years ago, even the capital markets leader must constantly look to improve and adapt to the times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so proud of the work we&rsquo;ve done, along with so many market participants, to ensure that we have the most efficient and resilient equity markets&mdash;delivering for investors and issuers alike.</p>

<title>BIS: Report For The G20 On Tokenisation Highlights The Opportunities, Risks And Future Considerations For Central Banks</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bis-report-for-the-g20-on-tokenisation-highlights-the-opportunities-risks-and/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Tokenisation, Central banks, Financial stability, Risks, Regulation <br />
<br />
Summary: Tokenisation has potential benefits for finance, but also poses risks. Central banks need to consider private initiatives, settlement assets, regulation, and monetary policy. <div>
<ul>
<li>Tokenisation could have implications for the future of finance and the role of central banks in payments, monetary policy and financial stability.</li>
<li>While tokenisation could offer numerous benefits for the financial system and broader economy, costs and risks also need to be considered.</li>
<li>BIS report highlights four key considerations for central banks: private sector initiatives; trade-offs between different types of settlement assets; sound regulation, supervision and oversight for tokenisation; and the impact on monetary policy implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tokenisation of money could have implications for the role of central banks in payments, monetary policy and financial stability, according to a report to the G20 published today by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d225.htm"><span class="firstword">Tokenisation</span>&nbsp;in the context of money and other assets: concepts and implications for central banks</a></em>, which was prepared by the BIS, including the BIS Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), examined tokenisation - the generation a<span>nd recording of digital representations of traditional assets</span>&nbsp;on a programmable platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also looked at global challenges in the regulated payments sector and focused on the possible benefits of tokenisation in addressing existing frictions in financial markets. It considered potential benefits of some of the innovative solutions involving new use cases and functions that are currently being explored around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It notes that, while the potential benefits of tokenisation, such as cheaper and speedier transactions, have attracted interest, the costs and risks need to be considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may also affect how pre- and post-trade functions are executed for money and other assets. In addition, ensuring appropriate governance and legal frameworks, credit and liquidity risks, as well as custody and operational risks will also require focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also highlights that risks may materialise in a different manner to the challenges faced by conventional market infrastructures. Tokenisation arrangements provide platform-based intermediation for financial assets that may lead to changes in how financial markets operate and are structured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, the report focuses on four key considerations for central banks:</p>
<ul>
<li>responding to ongoing private sector tokenisation initiatives; for example, whether to foster interoperability in the case of fragmenting markets;</li>
<li>assessing the trade-offs and the appropriate balance between different types of settlement assets in token arrangements;</li>
<li>Identifying, monitoring and assessing tokenisation arrangements that may need to be subject to sound regulation, supervision, and oversight; and</li>
<li>assessing the potential impact of token arrangements on monetary policy implementation, for example through changes in the structure of regulated markets or the demand for central bank versus other types of money.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Tokenisation has significant potential to improve the safety and efficiency of the financial system. Central banks along with the private sector must continue to explore novel technologies and develop solutions that are fit for purpose for the future financial system. However, tokenisation also poses economic, legal and technical challenges that must be addressed if it is to fulfil its potential. The BIS is committed to exploring aspects of these challenges through its analysis and Innovation Hub projects in the years ahead.</p>

<p>As with existing payment, clearing and settlement systems, the potential capacity of token arrangements to improve financial system safety and efficiency will require sound governance and risk management. The well known risks of existing systems apply, but these risks may materialise in different ways due to the effects of token arrangements on market structure.&nbsp; As follow-up to this report, the CPMI will continue its exploration of the topic, including the impact of innovation on the role of central bank money.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Examinations, priorities, 2025, risks
Summary:
SEC Division of Examinations released 2025 priorities including fiduciary duty, cybersecurity, and compliance with new rules to protect investors and market integrity.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Division of Examinations today released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/2025-exam-priorities.pdf">2025 examination priorities</a>. The Division publishes its examination priorities annually to inform investors and registrants of potential risks in the U.S. capital markets and to make them aware of the examination topics that the Division plans to focus on in the new fiscal year. This year&rsquo;s examinations will prioritize perennial and emerging risk areas, such as fiduciary duty, standards of conduct, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Division of Examinations 2025 priorities enhance trust in our ever-evolving markets,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;In examining for compliance with our time-tested rules, the Division plays a critical role in protecting investors and facilitating capital formation. Working with registrants to understand the rules helps ensure that markets work for investors and issuers alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our 2025 examination priorities identify the key areas of potentially increased risks and related harm for investors,&rdquo; said Keith Cassidy, Acting Director of the Division of Examinations. &ldquo;We hope that registrants will evaluate their compliance programs in the areas we identified and make the changes necessary to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Division examines SEC-registered investment advisers, investment companies, broker-dealers, clearing agencies, and self-regulatory organizations, among others, for compliance with federal securities laws. The Division prioritizes examinations of the practices, products, and services that were found, through a risk-based assessment, to present a heightened risk to investors or the integrity of the U.S. capital markets. The annual publication of the examination priorities furthers the SEC&rsquo;s mission and aligns with the Division&rsquo;s four pillars to promote and improve compliance, prevent fraud, monitor risk, and inform policy.</p>
<p>For fiscal year 2025, in addition to conducting examinations in core areas such as disclosures and governance practices, the Division will also examine for compliance with new rules, the use of emerging technologies, and the soundness of controls intended to protect investor information, records, and assets.</p>
<p>The 2025 examination priorities cover a broad landscape of potential risks to investors that firms should consider as they review and strengthen their compliance programs. They are not, however, an exhaustive list of all the areas the Division will focus on in the upcoming year.&nbsp; The scope of any examination includes analysis of other risk factors such as an entity&rsquo;s history, operations, and products and services.</p>

<title>FSB Urges Stronger Efforts To Enhance Cross Border Payments</title>

<div> Publications, FSB, cross-border payments, G20 Roadmap, progress report <br />
Summary: FSB reports progress on G20 Roadmap for cross-border payments, LEI implementation, and key performance indicators, highlighting areas needing further improvement. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>FSB publishes reports detailing work to enhance cross-border payments and welcomes the significant achievements of standard setters and international bodies in reducing obstacles to more effective cross border payments.</span></li>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>At the global level, the FSB&rsquo;s key performance indicators (KPIs) indicate that significant progress will be needed to improve the user experience across all payments market segments.</span></li>
<li><span>In addition,&nbsp;</span><span>some jurisdictions have made no tangible progress towards implementing the actions previously set out by the FSB to improve LEI adoption.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB calls for continued commitment and collaboration from multiple public and private sector organisations in order to achieve tangible results.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published (i) a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2024/">consolidated progress report for 2024</a>&nbsp;reporting on a broad range of actions being progressed as part of &nbsp;the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments; (ii) a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/implementation-of-the-legal-entity-identifier-progress-report/">progress report on the implementation of the Legal Entity Identifier</a>&nbsp;(LEI); and (iii) an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/annual-progress-report-on-meeting-the-targets-for-cross-border-payments-2024-report-on-key-performance-indicators/">annual progress report on meeting the improved user experience targets for cross-border payments</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, global efforts to enhance cross-border payments, led by the FSB, in coordination with the Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and relevant international organisations and standard-setting bodies, have continued apace. Strong progress was made in the G20 Roadmap&rsquo;s planned actions. These include harmonisation of ISO 20022 data requirements and the extension of operating hours, as well as key reports on the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) and the interlinking of fast payment systems (FPS). Progress was also made in addressing frictions arising from requirements for managing payments data and access to becoming a payments services provider. Recommendations on these two topics will be issued in December 2024.</p>
<p>Adoption of the LEI has continued to grow at double-digit rates since 2019. While widespread LEI implementation has been reached in OTC derivatives and securities markets, adoption in cross-border payments remains a challenge. The costs, particularly in low-income jurisdictions, and the lack of perceived incentives for voluntary adoption by market participants and end users, among other things, are notable obstacles to the wider adoption of the LEI. Some jurisdictions have made no tangible progress towards implementing the FSB&rsquo;s previously outlined actions. To maintain the momentum in expanding LEI adoption, particularly for cross-border payments, the FSB reiterates its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/07/options-to-improve-adoption-of-the-lei-in-particular-for-use-in-cross-border-payments/">2022 recommendations</a>&nbsp;and advocates for their full and timely implementation. The report includes additional recommendations for oversight authorities and standard-setting bodies to support this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while more than half of the planned actions set out by the G20 have been completed, the FSB&rsquo;s key performance indicators which measure key aspects of the user experience in using payments services, suggest that further efforts are needed. The FSB emphasises the importance of intensified effort and commitment from a range of stakeholders, including by domestic regulatory/oversight authorities and payments services providers. The FSB, CPMI and other partner standard-setting and international organisations are strongly committed to achieving tangible results by completing the planned actions, and supporting implementation by payments services providers and oversight authorities.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Background</h2>
<p>The G20 has made enhancing cross-border payments a priority to achieve faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. In 2020, the FSB, in coordination with the CPMI and other international organisations and standard-setting bodies, developed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/">Roadmap</a>&nbsp;to address these challenges. To provide accountability, in 2021, the G20 endorsed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/10/targets-for-addressing-the-four-challenges-of-cross-border-payments-final-report/">quantitative global targets</a>&nbsp;related to the wholesale, retail and remittance market segments. In 2022, the FSB issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/07/options-to-improve-adoption-of-the-lei-in-particular-for-use-in-cross-border-payments/">recommendations</a>&nbsp;for improving the adoption of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2012/06/fsb-report-global-legal-entity-identifier-for-financial-markets/">Legal Entity Identifier</a>&nbsp;(LEI) in cross-border payments to support G20 roadmap&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
<p>To move the Roadmap forward and facilitate achieving the G20 targets in 2027, in February 2023, the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/02/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priority-actions-for-achieving-the-g20-targets/">outlined specific actions&nbsp;</a>that will be taken under three priority themes covering: payment system interoperability and extension; legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks; and cross-border exchange and message standards.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>

The FCA fined Volkswagen Finance £5.4m for mistreating financially struggling customers, leading to a £21.5m redress for 110,000 customers. The case took 13 months. Volkswagen Finance notified investors during the investigation. It is a major motor finance provider in the UK. The FCA has previously fined other companies for similar failures. <br /><br /> <div>

<p>The FCA has fined Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited (Volkswagen Finance) &pound;5,397,600 for failing to treat its customers in financial difficulty fairly. Volkswagen Finance has agreed to pay over &pound;21.5m in redress to around 110,000 customers who may have suffered harm because of its failings.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between 1 January 2017 and 31 July 2023, Volkswagen Finance failed to understand customers&rsquo; individual circumstances or to provide support tailored to their needs. This meant that, in some cases, Volkswagen Finance took cars away from vulnerable customers without considering other options. This risked people being put in a worse position, particularly if they relied on their car to travel to work. Volkswagen Finance&rsquo;s failings were compounded by poor templated and automated communications.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s work resulted in Volkswagen Finance setting up a redress scheme to compensate affected customers. It has made improvements to its training for customer service staff and communications. It has also introduced a new debt collections model.</p>
<p>Volkswagen Finance&rsquo;s failings were identified during the FCA&rsquo;s supervisory work to assess&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/borrowers-financial-difficulty-project" title="Borrowers in financial difficulty (BiFD) project &ndash; supporting those facing payment difficulties due to coronavirus &ndash; interim findings">how lenders support borrowers in difficulty</a>. The FCA has worked with nearly 100 lenders in the last 4 years to improve the way they treat struggling customers, securing over &pound;65m in redress for over 320,000 customers. Earlier this year, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-2-strengthening-protections-borrowers-financial-difficulty" title="PS24/2: Strengthening protections for borrowers in financial difficulty: Consumer credit and mortgages">strengthened protections for borrowers</a>&nbsp;by making measures it introduced during the pandemic permanent.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</p>
<p>'For many, a car is not a nice to have but a necessity for work or for family life. Volkswagen Finance made tough personal situations worse by failing to consider what those in difficulty might need. It is right it compensates those who suffered. This fine and redress should send clear signals to lenders that they need to properly support those in financial difficulty.'</p>
<p>Volkswagen Finance will continue to contact affected customers with details of its redress scheme. Customers do not need to take action before that happens. However, if customers have any questions, would like further information, or their contact details have changed, they should contact Volkswagen Finance using the details provided on its&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://customer.vwfs.co.uk/ContactUs/help.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>This enforcement case was opened following the FCA&rsquo;s supervisory work. The enforcement investigation took a total of 13 months to complete, compared to an average of 42 months for investigations closed in 2023/24. It is an example of how the FCA is carrying out its enforcement work faster and with greater focus.</p>

<title>SIX Annual Future Of Finance Study Reveals, Financial Executives Optimistic</title>

<div> Swiss, Spanish stock exchanges, SIX, Future of Finance Study, global banking<br />
Summary:<br />
Cautious optimism in global finance, majority expect economic improvement, need for adjustments, alternative asset classes key, challenges include geopolitical uncertainties. <div>
<p><span>C-suite executives across the global banking and finance sector are displaying cautious optimism around the economic outlook, with a majority recognizing that their organizations will need to make adjustments in order to realize growth, according to new research from Swiss and Spanish stock exchanges operator SIX.</span></p>
<p>Over half (53%) of senior finance executives globally expect the economic environment to improve over the coming year, while a further 40% expect a continuation of current market conditions. That is according to the annual Future of Finance Study by SIX &ndash; the annual survey that canvasses the opinions of senior executives across 293 financial institutions across the world.</p>
<p>This optimism is tempered by a recognition from the majority of respondents that their companies will need to make further efforts in order to successfully take advantage of the potential they recognize for growth. Repeating a trend seen in 2023, Singaporean (53%) and Swiss (53%) companies feel the most positively about their own positions being strong, while asset managers (60%) and investment banks (62%) are the institution types that most strongly see themselves needing to take measures to achieve progression.</p>
<p>Regarding the key drivers for success, expanding into alternative asset classes (35%) rose from third-ranked in 2023 to top in 2024, replacing the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), which fell to fourth in the overall rankings, after a boom in interest at the time of last year&rsquo;s survey. Rounding out this year&rsquo;s top three is distributed ledger technology (DLT) (34%), which moves up two places since last year, and embedded finance (33%), rising by three.</p>
<p>Although financial institutions around the globe are generally anticipating favorable conditions for growth over the coming years, they also cite several factors that they expect to pose a challenge. Unsurprisingly, geopolitical uncertainties ranked top with over a third of respondents citing it as a major headwind (34%), with failure to adopt new technologies (31%) and global economic downturn (31%) completing the top three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that remains a constant in financial markets is the recognition that by embracing innovation, institutions are better placed to succeed,&rdquo; said Jos Dijsselhof, CEO SIX. &ldquo;Addressing the needs of capital markets companies through the continuous provision of choice is something that financial market infrastructure providers must take the lead on, to ensure that we are always supporting organizations to be globally competitive, and resilient to the challenges of the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full 2024 Future of Finance Study, comprised of four chapters covering growth, data and analytics, technology, and capital markets,&nbsp;<a href="https://six-group.com/future-finance-study">is available here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Rules, Reporting, Changes, Standards, Compliance
Summary:<br />2024 Reporting Rules align with international standards, consolidate provisions, and ensure fit-for-purpose reporting. ASIC allows compliance until March 2025.<br />ASIC engagement enhances OTC derivative data quality, demonstrating commitment to operational efficiency. <br /> <div>
<p>Commencing today, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Current/F2022L01706"><em>ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting) 2024</em></a>&nbsp;(2024 Reporting Rules) replace the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2022L01705/latest/text"><em>ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting) 2022.</em></a></p>
<p>The 2024 Reporting Rules make changes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>align with international reporting standards</li>
<li>consolidate transitional provisions and exemptions, and</li>
<li>ensure reporting requirements are fit for purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2024 Reporting Rules were made on 19 December 2022 following two rounds of public consultation in November 2020 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-334-proposed-changes-to-simplify-the-asic-derivative-transaction-rules-reporting-first-consultation/" title="CP 334 Proposed changes to simplify the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting): First consultation">CP 334</a>) and May 2022 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-361-proposed-changes-to-simplify-the-asic-derivative-transaction-rules-reporting-second-consultation/" title="CP 361 Proposed changes to simplify the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting): Second consultation">CP 361</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC then undertook another two rounds of public consultation in November 2023 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-361-proposed-changes-to-simplify-the-asic-derivative-transaction-rules-reporting-second-consultation/#CP361a" title="CP 361 Proposed changes to simplify the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting): Second consultation">CP 361a</a>) and February 2024 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-375-proposed-changes-to-the-asic-derivative-transaction-rules-reporting-third-consultation/" title="CP 375 Proposed changes to the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Reporting): Third consultation">CP 375</a>), which resulted in amendments to the 2024 Reporting Rules and supporting instruments being made.</p>
<p>In September 2024, we&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/otc-derivatives/derivative-transaction-reporting/" title="Derivative transaction reporting">published guidance materials for the 2024 Reporting Rules</a>&nbsp;and announced that we will take a measured approach to compliance until March 2025 for reporting entities that make reasonable efforts to comply with the 2024 Reporting Rules.</p>
<p>In preparation for the commencement of the 2024 Reporting Rules, we have undertaken extensive industry engagement to better understand implementation issues. Broadly, we have observed strong industry collaboration and engagement with the changes to the reporting requirements and thank reporting entities and stakeholders for their significant efforts to date.</p>
<p>Importantly, the changes will greatly enhance the conformity and consistency of OTC derivative transaction data and ultimately improve its quality and useability for a range of regulatory purposes.</p>
<p>This work advances ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to making changes to our practices to operate more efficiently with the regulated population.</p>

<div> Treasury, Janet Yellen, Financial Stability Oversight Council, banking, FHFA<br />
Summary: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen chaired a meeting discussing banking and real estate developments, liquidity management, private credit monitoring, and the Council's annual report. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen convened a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) in executive session at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>During the meeting, the Council received an update by staff of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on banking and commercial real estate developments. Council members noted that depository institutions should continue proactively to manage shifts in economic and interest rate conditions and discussed efforts undertaken by institutions and supervisors to enhance resilience planning.&nbsp; The Council also discussed the need for continued monitoring of credit conditions, and the impact of interest rates on banks&rsquo; net interest margins, deposit flows, and fair-value losses on securities.</span></p>
<p><span>The Council also received an update from Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) staff on an FHFA proposed rule to provide the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) with more flexibility to manage intraday liquidity and FHFA guidance to FHLBs on enhancing their credit risk management practices and liquidity access for members.</span></p>
<p><span>The Council also heard a presentation by Treasury staff on short-term investment vehicles (STIVs).&nbsp; STIVs have increased their assets under management in recent years and are significant funding providers in critical short-term funding markets.&nbsp; The Council discussed the performance of STIVs during prior stress events and the ongoing efforts of financial regulators to enhance the resilience of short-term funding markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, the Council received an update by staff of Treasury and other Council member agencies on regulators&rsquo; efforts to provide better visibility into private credit. &nbsp;Council members noted that the current lack of transparency in the private credit market can make it challenging for regulators to fully assess the buildup of risks in the sector, and discussed member agencies&rsquo; efforts to enhance monitoring of this market. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Council also received an update by Treasury staff on the continuing development of the Council&rsquo;s 2024 annual report.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, the Council voted to approve the minutes of its previous meeting on September 20, 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Keywords: centralized finance, decentralized finance, defi, financial intermediaries, technological innovation <br />
Summary: Centralized finance and decentralized finance are complementary, with defi offering technological innovations to improve efficiency in financial markets and bring benefits to households and businesses. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Thank you for inviting me to speak today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241018a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I have participated in this conference for nearly 20 years and have often presented my research on monetary theory, banking, and payments. So, I believe this is the right audience to speak to regarding the role of centralized finance and the emergence of decentralized finance, or defi for short. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of attention and work on defi, which will be a major focus of my remarks. Many argue that defi will replace traditional centralized finance while others argue that it merely extends traditional finance methods and trading activities onto new platforms. It is in this sense that I want to address the question of whether centralized finance and defi are substitutes or complements to each other.</p>
<p>Advances associated with defi have the potential to profoundly affect financial market trading. While I believe these advances could lead to efficiency gains, I recognize the significant value that has been delivered for centuries by financial intermediaries and through centralized financial markets. Before I share my views on the promise of these new technologies, let me tell you where I'm coming from on these issues.</p>
<p>I am an economist, and so my first inclination is to think about the underlying economics driving an issue. But to understand the value proposition of defi, it is useful to first recall why&nbsp;<em>centralized&nbsp;</em>financial market trading arose in the first place. Centralized finance clearly provides benefits to people, but obviously also comes with some costs. I am going to take a few minutes to discuss those benefits and costs before turning to the question at hand.</p>
<p>Let's start with the economics of trading. Most financial trades are "pairwise" in that the seller of an object needs to find a buyer of that exact object. The problem is that it is often complicated, costly, and time-consuming to search for a buyer. This gives rise to the need for someone to step in and help buyers and sellers match in a faster and less costly manner. In short, there is a profit opportunity for someone to intermediate the trade.</p>
<p>Another name for intermediaries is middlemen. Why would we pay a middleman? In their paper from nearly 40 years ago, Ariel Rubenstein and Asher Wolinsky described it eloquently: "What makes the middlemen's activity possible is the time-consuming nature of the trade, which enables middlemen to extract surplus in return for shortening the time period that sellers and buyers have to wait for a transaction."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241018a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Let me contextualize the value of middlemen with an example I used for years when teaching money and banking. Suppose you had some extra income from saving and wanted to lend it out to earn interest. How would you do that? First, you would have to advertise that you had funds to lend. Then, you would have to wait for the right person who needed that exact amount of funds, which could be a long time. Once you met the right person, you would have to negotiate when repayment would occur. Next, you would need to know a lot of information about the person receiving your funds and the likelihood you would get repaid. This is needed to assess the risk of the transaction and the compensation you would need to give up your funds. You would also need a lot of legal advice to draw up a contract and stipulate how the contract would be enforced under a range of conditions. Finally, since you are the sole source of funding, you will bear the entire cost of a default. It should be clear that this would be a daunting exercise for most people and explains why they would turn to a middleman who specializes in this type of activity to do all this on their behalf.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that banks arose as early as in ancient Mesopotamia to carry out some of these functions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241018a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Similar issues arise when it comes to other ways of transferring resources from one person to another, as occurs from non-bank debt, equities and insurance contracts. Many point to trades of shares in the Dutch East India Trading Company in Amsterdam in the 1660s as the origins of the first modern stock exchange. Lloyds of London was founded as a means of pooling funds to share risk and return in the shipping industry, thus becoming the first insurance firm. The fact that similar arrangements still exist centuries later is a testament to the value of intermediation and centralized financial trading.</p>
<p>However, these arrangements are not without drawbacks. An obvious drawback of intermediation from the perspective of those wishing to trade is that those middlemen must get paid. That is, there are transaction costs. Another drawback of intermediation is that you typically must turn over control of your assets, such as savings or stocks, to the intermediary for them to be traded. This creates a classic "principal-agent" problem whereby incentives between the principal&mdash;you&mdash;and the agent&mdash;the intermediary&mdash;may not be aligned. That can raise concerns about custody arrangements and recourse to regain control of one's assets. Intermediation also requires recordkeeping arrangements that customers can trust accurately reflect their true holdings. In other words, centralized finance requires a substantial amount of trust. With all that in mind, let me turn to how and why technological innovations have given rise to defi.</p>
<p>In a capitalist system, the existence of profits provides incentives for others to enter the market, offer a better product, and compete away any excess profits. This can be done by the creation of new financial firms that can provide the same or better service at a lower cost. Often that occurs through innovations and exploiting new technologies. Think about how the invention of the telegraph and the telephone revolutionized trading. More recently, the advent of the internet further advanced the ease and speed of financial trading. These are examples of how financial trading has evolved over time. And the next wave of innovations in financial market trading could be driven by technological advances that alleviate some potential drawbacks of the centralized approach.</p>
<p>Often broad technological advances emanate from narrower efforts to design products or processes that solve specific problems. For example, one technology used to support portable home appliances like vacuum cleaners was originally developed to support the space program.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241018a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Similarly, the development of crypto-assets led to the development of technologies that are fueling possibilities in defi.</p>
<p>We don't have enough time for me to cover the full history of crypto-assets, but I will focus on several key elements that have affected the evolution toward defi. An early crypto-asset&mdash;Bitcoin&mdash;was developed to function in a world in which trust among individuals did not exist. Rather than relying on intermediaries which require trust, Bitcoin relied on technology to facilitate trade. Bitcoin was also designed for privacy. No one would know who was buying or selling Bitcoin. This was achieved through cryptographic technology and private keys. In addition, it allowed individuals to maintain control of their crypto-assets throughout the entire trading process. That is, they no longer had to delegate control to others. Finally, all records were kept on a form of distributed ledger called a blockchain, which has design features that promote transparency and are censorship-proof. No individual or government could destroy the records of trades or take ownership of the objects traded.</p>
<p>With that history in mind and before we delve into the question of whether defi and centralized finance are substitutes or complements, I think it is useful to carefully define some terms. This will make sure we're all talking about the same things. As I described in a speech last year, I think of the crypto ecosystem as consisting of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a crypto-asset, which generally refers to any digital object traded using cryptographic techniques;</li>
<li>technology that directly facilitates trading crypto-assets; this includes smart contracts and tokenization;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241018a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;and</li>
<li>a database management protocol used to record trades and ownership of assets, commonly referred to as the blockchain, which includes both permissioned and permissionless distributed ledger technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is easy to see how the emergence of these technologies could lead one to think of defi as a&nbsp;<em>substitute</em>&nbsp;for centralized finance. For example, the technologies are allowing for individuals to trade assets without giving up control of those assets to an intermediary&mdash;a critical distinction with centralized finance.</p>
<p>However, there are other uses emerging from these technologies that look more like&nbsp;<em>complements</em>&nbsp;to centralized finance. For example, distributed ledger technology, or DLT, may be an efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping in a 24/7 trading world. We already see several financial institutions experimenting with DLT for traditional repo trading that occurs 24/7. But before these ledgers can be used to facilitate transactions in traditional assets&mdash;like debt, equity, and real estate&mdash;these assets must be tokenized. Undertaking the process to tokenize assets and use distributed ledgers like blockchain can speed up transfers of assets and take advantage of another innovation: smart contracts.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on each party to separately carry out the transaction, smart contracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act executed by a smart contract. This can provide value as it can mitigate risks associated with settlement and counterparty risks by ensuring the buyer will not pay if the seller does not deliver. While these efforts are still in early stages, the functionality could expand to a broad set of financial activities. The bottom line is that things like DLT, tokenization, and smart contracts are just technologies for trading that can be used in defi or also to improve efficiency in centralized finance. That is why I see them as complements.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are another important innovation in defi. Stablecoins were created in the crypto universe in hopes of providing a "safe" asset with a stable value for trading. Nearly all stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar one-for-one. They provide an opportunity for buyers and sellers to transact in a decentralized fashion with the stablecoin used as the settlement instrument. Because they are effectively digital currency, stablecoins can reduce the need for payment intermediaries and thereby reduce costs of payments globally. But their safety is not assured. History is replete with cases in which synthetic dollars became subject to runs. Stablecoins thus face all of the same issues any substitute for genuine U.S. dollars faces. If appropriate guardrails can be erected to minimize run risk and mitigate other risks, such as their potential use in illicit finance, then stablecoins may have benefits in payments and by serving as a safe asset on a variety of new trading platforms.</p>
<p>These technologies will almost certainly lead to efficiency gains over time, but as they develop, we should think carefully about their role in the broader financial landscape.</p>
<p>Is it really possible to completely decentralize finance using these technologies? The answer is obviously "no." Intermediation is still valuable for the average person, and we see this by the existence of trading exchanges in the crypto world. All these platforms involve giving custody of one's crypto-assets to an intermediary, who conducts trades on behalf of the client. This reintroduces the need for trust in these platforms just as trust is needed in modern banking systems.</p>
<p>Returning to the technologies behind defi, one must ask whether there are unique risks associated with the use of these technologies. If so, what is the nature of these risks? Are they contained to just those people directly engaging with the technologies, or could there be broader spillovers to society? For example, can these technologies increase the risk of inadvertently providing funds to bad actors? In centralized finance there are regulations that require banks to know who their clients are. Are similar rules and regulations needed around some of these new technologies? When it comes to our financial plumbing, which affects every person or business in one way or another, I think a balanced view of expeditious disruption and long-term sustainability is merited.</p>
<p>So where does that leave us? Ultimately, I believe that advances in technology have the potential to drive efficiency gains in finance, just as technological innovation has done for centuries. While there are certain services emerging through defi that cannot be provided by centralized finance, the technological innovations stemming from defi are largely complementary to centralized finance. They have the potential to improve centralized finance, thereby increasing the significant value that financial intermediaries and centralized financial markets deliver. I look forward to seeing the continued evolution of financial technology and the benefits that evolution will bring to the households and businesses served by the financial system.</p>

<div> consumer protection, financial literacy, education initiatives, fraud, collaboration
Summary:
Finansinspektionen evaluates financial education initiatives and identifies risks for consumers. Initiatives include teaching professionals, targeting vulnerable groups, and collaborating for effective education. <div>
<p><span>Many people find it difficult to make decisions about their finances. The majority of Swedes understand financial terms but are not knowledgeable about how these concepts impact their own finances. Finansinspektionen (FI) is releasing a report today that evaluates the authority&rsquo;s work with financial education and identifies a number of areas where deficient financial literacy could impose significant risks on the consumer.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>As part of its consumer protection work, FI has been strengthening the position of the consumer on the financial market through financial education since 2009. The primary objective is to safeguard the basic financial knowledge of Sweden's population and contribute to improved financial literacy in society. FI has received an assignment from the Government to evaluate this work.</p>
<p>A key part of this work is twofold: to teach professionals in order to reach particularly vulnerable groups and to assist schools with teaching material on personal finances.</p>
<p>We note in the report that fraud is a steadily growing problem for consumers, and we have observed that many consumers are not knowledgeable about internet safety and risky investments. The use of educational initiatives as a preventive measure can contribute to reducing the number of vulnerable consumers by increasing their resilience.The report also shows that there are major differences in both the financial literacy and confidence of different groups. FI therefore targets new arrivals, parents and young adults with tailored educational initiatives.</p>
<p>FI represents a central part of the work with personal finance education in Sweden, in part through its own initiatives but also through collaboration with others. The Swedish National Network on Financial Education, which the authority coordinates, has played a key role in authorities, industry actors and non-profit organisation being able to collaborate and work effectively in this area. The development we have seen on the financial market in the past few years and the consumer risks we are seeing today make the work with financial education increasingly important, and more initiatives could be taken to strengthen consumers.</p>

<div> Agreement, Liquidity, Oversight, Consultation, Governance
Summary:<br /><br />ECB revised ELA agreement, launched public consultation on oversight requirements for payment systems, approved EPCO mandate, and updated ECB representatives' responsibilities on Supervisory Board. Approved 2023 report on statistical confidentiality and amended statistical information Guideline. <div>
<h2>Market operations</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk179802130"></a><em>Regular review of the agreement on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA)</em></p>
<p>On 27 September 2024 the Governing Council adopted a revised version of the ELA agreement, which contains more detailed information on the key elements taken into consideration when providing ELA. In particular, it introduces compliance with the leverage ratio as a solvency criterion for the provision of ELA to credit institutions. The revised version also introduces the key principle that ELA collateral should sufficiently protect the national central bank against risks emerging from ELA operations. The&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.agreementemergencyliquidityassistance202410~b8b78cd4f5.en.pdf">agreement</a>, which is available on the ECB&rsquo;s website, will next be reviewed in 2027.</p>
<h2>Market infrastructure and payments</h2>
<p><em>Public consultation on a draft ECB recast regulation on oversight requirements for systemically important payment systems</em></p>
<p>On 4 October 2024 the Governing Council endorsed a draft ECB regulation recasting European Central Bank regulation (EU) No 795/2014 on oversight requirements for systemically important payment systems (ECB/2014/28) (hereinafter the &ldquo;SIPS Regulation&rdquo;) and approved the launch of a six-week public consultation on the draft recast regulation. As the SIPS Regulation has been substantially amended several times, following a review by the Governing Council of the general application of the SIPS Regulation under Article 24 thereof and an assessment of whether it needs to be amended, a recast of the SIPS Regulation was considered necessary in the interest of clarity. The material related to the public consultation, which runs until 29 November 2024, is&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/intro/cons/html/SIPS_regulation_recast.en.html">available</a>&nbsp;on the ECB&rsquo;s website.</p>
<h2>Corporate governance</h2>
<p><em>Eurosystem Procurement Coordination Office (EPCO) mandate from 2025 to 2029</em></p>
<p>On 4 October 2024 the Governing Council took note of the positive evaluation of the third term of EPCO since its establishment (see Decision ECB/2008/17) and approved the mandate for its fourth term, from 2025 to 2029. The Banque centrale du Luxembourg was recently designated by the Governing Council to continue hosting EPCO for that same period. EPCO identifies, assesses and coordinates joint procurements of goods and services necessary for the performance of Eurosystem tasks, with a view to maximising cost efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p><em>Allocation of responsibilities of the ECB representatives on the Supervisory Board</em></p>
<p>On 8 October 2024 the Governing Council took note of an updated allocation of responsibilities of the ECB representatives on the Supervisory Board in view of three new members, Patrick Montagner, Sharon Donnery and Pedro Machado, taking up office on 1 September 2024, 1 January 2025 and 1 March 2025 respectively. These responsibilities will be reflected in the &ldquo;areas of interest&rdquo; section of their respective CVs published in due course on the ECB&rsquo;s Banking Supervision website.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk179802019"></a><em>2023 annual report on protecting the confidentiality of the individual statistical information collected by the ECB, assisted by the national central banks</em></p>
<p>On 27 September 2024 the Governing Council, with the benefit of observations from the members of the General Council, approved the 2023 report entitled &ldquo;Statistical confidentiality protection in the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)&rdquo; and authorised its publication. The&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/pdf/statisticalconfidentialityprotectionreport2023.en.pdf">report&nbsp;</a>is available on the ECB&rsquo;s website and on the websites of the NCBs that also decided to publish it.</p>
<p><em>ECB Guideline amending Guideline (EU) 2021/831 on statistical information to be reported on financial intermediaries other than monetary financial institutions (ECB/2021/12)</em></p>
<p>On 10 October 2024 the Governing Council, with the benefit of observations from the members of the General Council, adopted Guideline ECB/2024/27 amending Guideline (EU) 2021/831 on statistical information to be reported on financial intermediaries other than monetary financial institutions. The amending Guideline aligns the provisions on the transmission of aggregated investment fund statistics from the NCBs to the ECB with those in Regulation (EU) 2024/1988 of the European Central Bank of 27 June 2024 concerning statistics on investment funds and repealing Decision (EU) 2015/32 (ECB/2014/62) (ECB/2024/17). In addition, it introduces the transmission of fund-by-fund data from the NCBs to the ECB. The Guideline will be published in due course on EUR-Lex.</p>

<title>Court Enters Final Judgment In Case Striking Down Missouri Consent Rules And Awarding Attorney’s Fees To SIFMA</title>

<div> Appeal, Attorney's fees, Preemption, Securities, Missouri
Summary:
The federal court ruled in favor of SIFMA, striking down Missouri's consent rules, resulting in the payment of attorney's fees. This affirms federal securities law preemption and constitutional violations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>On October 17 a federal court in Missouri entered final judgment in favor of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) on its legal challenge to certain consent rules issued by the Missouri Secretary of State John R. Ashcroft and the Missouri Securities Commissioner Douglas Jacoby (collectively, &ldquo;Defendants&rdquo;).&nbsp; The rules required financial firms and professionals that incorporated &ldquo;a social objective or other nonfinancial objective&rdquo; into their investment advice to obtain customers&rsquo; written consent to state-scripted language acknowledging that the advice is inconsistent with maximizing financial returns.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2024, the Missouri federal court entered an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024.08.14-Order-on-Motions-for-Summary-Judgment.pdf" target="_blank">order</a>&nbsp;granting SIFMA&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment, denying Defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, and striking down the Missouri rules in their entirety on both federal preemption and constitutional grounds.</p>
<p>Defendants appealed the court&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.&nbsp; Subsequently, the parties agreed upon a stipulated award of $500,000 of attorney&rsquo;s fees to SIFMA, contingent upon Defendants withdrawing their appeal.&nbsp; Defendants have since withdrawn their appeal and paid attorneys&rsquo; fees to SIFMA.&nbsp; At the parties&rsquo; request, the court has now entered final judgment in this matter and brought it to a close. This means that Defendants may no longer require financial firms and professionals to use the prescribed language or forms that were the subject of the Missouri rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s final judgment affirms that the Missouri rules are preempted by the National Securities Markets Improvements Act (NSMIA) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and are unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. &nbsp;Beyond the clear violations of NSMIA and ERISA, the alleged problem the rules sought to address&mdash;firms providing insufficient disclosure in connection with investment advice&mdash;was already prohibited under federal law.&nbsp; As such, this decision affirms the primacy of federal securities law, and it helps avoid a patchwork of conflicting and burdensome state rules that would undermine our national market system,&rdquo; stated SIFMA President and CEO, Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. &nbsp;&ldquo;Now, the rules are fully stricken, and SIFMA&rsquo;s members are free to go about their business with that certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s ruling is&nbsp;<em>not only</em>&nbsp;a strong reminder about the clear limits imposed by NSMIA and ERISA on state regulation of securities activities,&rdquo; Bentsen continued, &ldquo;<em>but also</em>&nbsp;an even stronger reminder to&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;regulators that adopting unlawful rules can and will result in the payment of attorney&rsquo;s fees.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SET To Tighten Broker Oversight With Stricter Penalty Framework, Effective November 1, 2024</title>

<div> regulatory regime, member brokerages, fines, violations, trading rules
Summary:
SET implements stricter fines for broker violations, including triple penalties for naked short-selling and increased fines for late margin calls. The new framework is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is set to implement a more rigorous regulatory regime for member brokerages, introducing a more stringent fine structure effective November 1, 2024. This move is part of SET's broader initiative to strengthen its regulatory mechanisms and ensure strict adherence to trading rules.</p>
<p>Brokerage violations are classified into four categories: 1) trading systems, program trading, installation sites, and hardware network connection, 2) system-based trading supervision by members, 3) membership qualifications and duties, and 4) trading activities.</p>
<p>Fines have been significantly increased to better reflect the severity of offenses and their potential market impacts. Notable changes include the fine penalty against naked short-selling offenses which now triple to three times the illicit profits, with a new minimum penalty of THB 1 million (approx. USD 30,030). This represents a substantial increase from the existing scheme, which merely matches the profit without a baseline fine. Additionally, brokers failing to make timely margin calls will face fines of THB 30,000, up from the previous threshold of THB 10,000.</p>
<p>The new framework has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission following extensive market consultations.</p>
<p>For more information on updated regulations, please see the &ldquo;Circular Letters for Member&rdquo; topic under the &ldquo;Rule and Regulations&rdquo; section on the SET's website at <a href="http://www.set.or.th/">www.set.or.th</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Enhanced Application Timeframe, New Listing applications, SFC, Exchange, regulatory concerns
<br />
Summary: The SFC and the Exchange announced an Enhanced Application Timeframe for New Listing applications, providing greater clarity and certainty, and introducing an Accelerated Timeframe for eligible A-share listed companies. <div>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The Securities and Futures Commission (the&nbsp;<span>SFC</span>) and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the&nbsp;<span>Exchange</span>), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (<span>HKEX</span>), are pleased to jointly announce</span><span>&nbsp;today (Friday)</span><span>&nbsp;an enhanced timeframe for the New Listing</span><span class="spanHeading"><span>1</span></span><span>&nbsp;application process (<span>Enhanced Application Timeframe</span>), to further elevate Hong Kong&rsquo;s attractiveness as the leading international listing venue in the region.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">Over the years, the SFC and the Exchange have made continuous efforts to enhance the application process for New Listing applications, offering guidance, clarity and transparency to the market. Since 2023, both regulators have made their work processes more transparent by publishing additional vetting statistics. In addition, the Exchange also consolidated all guidance materials into one published Guide for New Listing Applicants to facilitate the market in preparing New Listing applications and disclosures.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Enhanced Application Timeframe, among the other initiatives, underscores the regulators&rsquo; ongoing commitment to facilitate the listing of quality companies in Hong Kong and uphold the public interest.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">Current Regulatory Framework</span></p>
<p>Under the current structure for reviewing New Listing applications, the SFC, as the statutory regulator, administers the Securities and Futures (Stock Market Listing) Rules (<span>SMLR</span>) and the Securities and Futures Ordinance (<span>SFO</span>). It reviews all New Listing applications and engages in targeted intervention in more serious listing matters that fall within the scope of the SMLR or the SFO. The Exchange, as the frontline regulator, administers the Listing Rules and is responsible for making decisions under the Listing Rules on matters such as determining suitability for listing. The Listing Committee considers and decides whether to approve New Listing applications and, where appropriate, raises comments on eligibility and suitability for listing, as well as on material listing document disclosures.</p>
<p><span class="spanHeading">Enhanced Application Timeframe</span></p>
<p>The Enhanced Application Timeframe will provide greater clarity and certainty to the timeline for reviewing New Listing applications by the SFC and the Exchange.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span><span>Applications Fully Meeting Requirements</span></span></p>
<p><span class="spanHeading">The SFC and the Exchange work closely together on the New Listing application process and will continue to coordinate their regulatory actions under the Enhanced Application Timeframe. Where an applicant and its sponsor submit a New Listing application and related materials that meet all applicable requirements and guidance under the SFO, the SMLR and/or the Listing Rules (<span>Applications Fully Meeting Requirements</span>), the SFC and the Exchange will, after close communication to avoid duplication of comments, individually assess and indicate any&nbsp;<span class="spanHeading">material regulatory concerns (<span>Regulators&rsquo; Assessment</span>)&nbsp;</span><span class="spanHeading">after a maximum of&nbsp;<span>two rounds</span>&nbsp;of regulatory comments</span>. In this scenario, the time taken by each regulator to confirm whether there are any material regulatory concerns will be no more than&nbsp;<span>40 business days</span></span><span class="spanHeading">2</span><span class="spanHeading">. Upon confirmation of no material regulatory concern, the Exchange will work with the applicant and its sponsor to finalise the disclosure in the listing document, following which the application will move forward to the Listing Committee Hearing.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">The applicant and its sponsor are expected to take a total of around 60 business days to satisfactorily address regulators&rsquo; comments. Subject to obtaining approvals from the Listing Committee and other authorities or regulators, the application process would be completed within the six-month application validity window. Please refer to the attached chart (<span>Appendix</span>) for an illustration of the Enhanced Application Timeframe under such scenario.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Accelerated Timeframe for Eligible A-share Listed Companies</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">If an existing A-share listed company meets the following criteria when submitting a New Listing application: (a) it is expected to have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$10 billion</span><span class="spanHeading">3</span><span class="spanHeading">; and (b) it can confirm, with the support of legal advisers&rsquo; opinion, that it has complied with all laws and regulations, in all material respects, applicable to its A-share listing throughout the two full financial years immediately preceding the New Listing application and up to the date of submitting the New Listing application, then the A-share listed company is eligible for an accelerated timeframe for the New Listing application process (<span>Accelerated Timeframe</span>).</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">Under the Accelerated Timeframe, if&nbsp;</span><span class="spanHeading">an</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;eligible A-share listed company submits an Application Fully Meeting</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;Requirements</span><span class="spanHeading">, the Regulators&rsquo; Assessment will be completed after&nbsp;<span>one round</span>&nbsp;of regulatory comments. In this scenario, each regulator will take no more than&nbsp;<span>30 business days</span>&nbsp;(instead of 40 business days<span>&nbsp;</span>for other New Listing applications under &ldquo;Applications Fully Meeting Requirements&rdquo; above) to complete the Regulators&rsquo; Assessment.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">If the SFC and/or the Exchange indicate that they have material regulatory concerns over the New Listing application of an eligible A-share listed company, as determined by the Regulators&rsquo; Assessment, the Accelerated Timeframe will no longer apply. In such case, the application process will be subject to the procedures set out in &ldquo;Applications Requiring Longer Process&rdquo; below.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Applications Requiring Longer Process</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">If the SFC and/or the Exchange have material concerns regarding an applicant&rsquo;s compliance with the SFO, the SMLR and/or the Listing Rules and/or the quality of listing document preparation, or if there are new material developments or incomplete responses to regulators&rsquo; comments, the SFC and the Exchange will proactively engage with the applicant and its sponsor to</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;enhance</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;</span><span class="spanHeading">their understanding of the relevant regulatory concerns.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">After the issue of the first comment letter (<span>1CL</span>), the SFC and/or the Exchange will, where necessary, engage with the key representatives of the applicant and its sponsor, as well as other advisers, to facilitate their understanding of the material regulatory concerns and outline the regulators&rsquo; expectations on their subsequent response.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">If any subsequent responses to the regulatory comments are materially incomplete, the SFC and/or the Exchange will inform the applicant and its sponsor of the deficiency and suspend the vetting process until a complete and satisfactory reply is received.</span></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">If the applicant and its sponsor do not adequately address the material regulatory concerns raised by the SFC and/or the Exchange after two rounds of regulatory comments (or one round under the &ldquo;Accelerated Timeframe for Eligible A-share Listed Companies&rdquo; above), the SFC and/or the Exchange will issue a direct requisition letter under the SMLR (<span>SMLR Letter</span>) and/or a major concerns letter (<span>MCL</span>) as appropriate. The progress of the application will then be subject to the applicant and its sponsor satisfactorily addressing the material regulatory concerns set out in the SMLR Letter and/or the MCL.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="spanHeading">Under such scenario, the timeline of the application process may be lengthened.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The SFC and the Exchange believe that the Enhanced Application Timeframe will help better support the Hong Kong listing journey for prospective issuers, as it provides more clarity and certainty regarding the timing and rounds of comments from both regulators, as well as enhanced transparency in the application process for New Listing applications. Applicants and their sponsors are encouraged to communicate with the regulators should they have any questions on the regulators&rsquo; comments.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Mr Michael Duignan, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Corporate Finance, said: &ldquo;The SFC has always been committed to transparency, accountability and better efficiency in listing regulation. We fully support the Enhanced Application Timeframe initiative, which is in line with our strategic priority to improve the global competitiveness and appeal of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span class="spanHeading">Ms Katherine Ng, HKEX&rsquo;s Head of Listing, said: &ldquo;At HKEX, we are committed to fulfilling our regulatory responsibilities by carefully and efficiently reviewing New Listing applications. We believe that the Enhanced Application Timeframe, including the introduction of the Accelerated Timeframe for eligible A-share listed companies, will provide greater clarity and certainty in the application process for New Listing applications, thereby assisting potential applicants and their advisers in formulating their listing plans, and further elevating Hong Kong&rsquo;s attractiveness as an IFC. We&nbsp;</span><span class="spanHeading">look forward to continuing to work closely with our prospective issuers and their advisers, and, together with their cooperation</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;and support</span><span class="spanHeading">, contribute to an even more efficient and timely vetting process.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">The SFC and the Exchange will continue to welcome market feedback and appreciate the commitment of applicants and their advisers to high standards when preparing New Listing applications, to realise the benefits of the Enhanced Application Timeframe.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Enhanced Application Timeframe will be applicable to New Listing applications filed after the date of this Joint Statement.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Notes:</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Yulan bond, Shanghai Clearing House, Euroclear Bank, Chinese issuers<br />
Summary:<br />
Luxembourg Stock Exchange lists DFZQ's Yulan bond, facilitating Chinese access to global investors, with collaboration from Shanghai Clearing House and Euroclear Bank. <div>
<p>This week, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE), Orient Securities Company Limited (DFZQ), Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH) and Euroclear Bank announced the successful listing of DFZQ&rsquo;s EUR 100 million Yulan bond on LuxSE&rsquo;s Euro MTF.</p>
<p>Through the listing of this bond, LuxSE becomes the first European exchange to list and admit this unique asset class to trading. Yulan bonds are issued through the Shanghai Clearing House, and are especially designed to link Chinese issuers with global investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The listing of the first Euro-denominated Yulan Bond marks a milestone in DFZQ&rsquo;s pioneering efforts toward further financial market opening-up and high-level development in the bond market, especially in 2024, a critical year to the 14th Five-Year Plan. We would like to express our gratitude to Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Shanghai Clearing House and Euroclear Bank, as well as all the investors who have consistently shown exceptional support for us. Going forward, DFZQ will continue to contribute to the development of a robust financial industry,&rdquo; commented Lu Weiming, President of Orient Securities Company Limited.</p>
<p><b>A pathway to international capital markets</b></p>
<p>A Yulan bond is an offshore bond issued by a Chinese-based entity through SHCH and settled exclusively through Brussels-based Euroclear Bank. Yulan bonds give Chinese domestic entities the opportunity to access international capital markets thanks to the cross-border cooperation between SHCH and Euroclear Bank as domestic and foreign central securities depository infrastructures.</p>
<p>The aim of these bonds is to further facilitate investment flows between international investors and Chinese issuers, and thereby expand financing options for Chinese companies. The structure derives its name from the yulan flower, which is the official flower of the city of Shanghai where this bond type was created. The first Yulan bond was issued by Bank of China in 2021.</p>
<p>Deputy General Manager, Shanghai Clearing House, Mr. Wang Weiqiang stated: "This successful listing proves that Yulan bonds are in line with international market regulation and practice, and will help improve market liquidity of Yulan bonds and advance its price discovery function. In the next step, under the guidance of the regulatory authorities, Shanghai Clearing House will continue to optimise the business mechanism of Yulan bonds together with our market infrastructure and institutional partners, to provide safe and high-efficiency infrastructure services for domestic and foreign issuers and investors, and contribute to the high-level opening up of China's financial market.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>New cross-border opportunities</b></p>
<p>The listing of DFZQ&rsquo; Yulan bond on LuxSE was made possible through a tripartite collaboration between LuxSE, SHCH and Euroclear Bank together with the issuer, which gives international investors a new opportunity to trade the Chinese bond on LuxSE&rsquo;s market, with trade settlement to take place in Euroclear Bank&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p>Philippe Laurensy, CEO of Asia Pacific at Euroclear, said: "This listing represents a significant achievement for our Yulan bond structure. Collaborating with key partners, Orient Securities, Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Shanghai Clearing House enables us to offer a new investment route into China.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>LuxSE as a gateway to China</b></p>
<p>For more than 40 years, LuxSE has been the European listing venue of choice for Chinese issuers wishing to tap into international capital markets, and for international investors looking to channel capital into the capital market of China.</p>
<p>Through the listing of DFZQ&rsquo;s Yulan bond on LuxSE, the exchange cements its position as a key infrastructure in bridging the gap between Chinese and international capital markets and reaffirms its position of contributing to the development of China&rsquo;s bond market on the international stage. In April this year, LuxSE welcomed the first Panda bond to be listed on the exchange, issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Panda bonds refer to a CNY-denominated bond issued by a non-Chinese entity in China&rsquo;s onshore bond market and which is available to both onshore and offshore investors. The exchange is now adding Yulan bonds to its broad range of securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our great pleasure to be chosen by Orient Securities to bring its Yulan bond to international capital markets, and we are proud to be the first European exchange to offer the opportunity to trade in this unique asset class. We applaud Orient Securities for its work, and Shanghai Clearing House and Euroclear Bank for their commitment to our shared vision of a truly international and united capital markets ecosystem,&rdquo; said Arnaud Delestienne, Member of the Executive Committee of LuxSE.</p>

<title>ASIC Acts To Protect Small Business - Q1 FY25 Update</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-acts-to-protect-small-business-q1-fy25-update/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Prosecutions, disqualifications, criminal charges, liquidators, failure to assist liquidators
Summary:
ASIC took action against 68 individuals for failing to assist liquidators and disqualified three directors for various breaches. Criminal prosecutions were also initiated against two directors for dishonest conduct. Liquidators can request ASIC's assistance when directors fail to comply with legislative requirements. During the period, fines of over $315,000 were imposed on 68 defendants for failing to assist liquidators, and the disqualification of directors was carried out. Summary: <div>
<p>ASIC is committed to protecting the interests of small business and acting against directors who fail to properly manage their companies and assist liquidators after a company collapse. ASIC does this by taking administrative and court action for breaches of duties. These actions result in directors being disqualified and convicted, and protect the wider public, employees and other small businesses against the future mismanagement of companies.</p>
<p>During the period 1 July to 30 September 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC prosecuted 68 individuals who failed to assist liquidators following the collapse of their company and disqualified three company directors, including two for the maximum period of five years&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) continued prosecutions against two directors for dishonest conduct relating to company money following investigations by ASIC.</li>
</ul>
<p>These criminal prosecutions and administrative actions were taken against directors in relation to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>tax avoidance and failing to lodge tax returns</li>
<li>failing to pay employee entitlements including wages and superannuation</li>
<li>failing to maintain proper books and records, and</li>
<li>conduct that was not in the best interests of the company including illegal phoenix activity and insolvent trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>The failure of these directors to meet their statutory obligations adversely impacted many small business creditors across a range of industries including construction, property development, transport, warehousing and freight. These failures left many creditors unpaid including other small businesses, employees, and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<p>Company directors should obtain trusted professional advice if they are uncertain about their legal obligations or have concerns about their company&rsquo;s ability to continue to trade and pay their debts. Find out more on <a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-business/small-business/starting-a-small-business-company/legal-requirements-for-companies/#advice" title="Legal requirements for companies">professional advice</a>.</p>
<h2>Director disqualifications &nbsp;</h2>
<p>In addition to the recent five-year disqualification periods handed down to Richard Sparreboom (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-178mr-asic-disqualifies-vic-director-for-maximum-five-years/" title="24-178MR ASIC disqualifies VIC director for maximum five years">24-178MR</a>) and Graeme Doble (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-214mr-asic-disqualifies-nsw-director-for-five-years-following-the-failure-of-six-companies/" title="24-214MR ASIC disqualifies NSW director for five years following the failure of six companies">24-214MR</a>), ASIC also disqualified VIC Director Benjamin Anderson for a four year period following his involvement in seven failed companies that owed a combined total of $35,610,506. Mr Anderson&rsquo;s companies were concerned with construction, property development and project management.</p>
<p>ASIC found that Mr Anderson acted improperly allowing one company, Australian Public Custodian Ltd (APC) to trade while insolvent and to have undocumented and unsecured loans between APC and related parties. ASIC also found Mr Anderson failed to maintain proper books and records and to comply with statutory lodgements, including income tax returns with the ATO.</p>
<p>In disqualifying these directors, ASIC relied on supplementary reports lodged by certain liquidators after ASIC approved funding from the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/registered-liquidators/your-ongoing-obligations-as-a-registered-liquidator/assetless-administration-fund/" title="Assetless Administration Fund">Assetless Administration Fund</a>. The liquidators of Mr Anderson&rsquo;s companies were Glenn Spooner of Cor Cordis, Robert Ditrich of Price Waterhouse Cooper and Liam Bellamby of RRI Advisory were the liquidators.</p>
<p>Directors may be disqualified from managing a corporation for a maximum of five years. They are listed on ASIC&rsquo;s public <a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-s-registers/banned-and-disqualified/" title="Banned and disqualified">banned and disqualified persons register</a>&nbsp;and can face criminal charges if they don&rsquo;t comply with the disqualification order. Directors can seek a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision by the Administrative Review Tribunal.</p>
<h2>Criminal prosecutions</h2>
<p>On 30 July 2024, NSW Director Mark Stevens appeared in the Downing Centre Local Court and was formerly charged with dishonestly causing a $110,000 payable to his company MWCLMS Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) to be redirected to another company Australasian Justice Services Pty Ltd (in Liquidation) contrary to section 192E(1)(b) of the <em>Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)</em>&nbsp;(refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-168mr-nsw-director-charged-with-dishonestly-causing-a-financial-disadvantage-to-his-company/" title="24-168MR NSW director charged with dishonestly causing a financial disadvantage to his company">24-168MR</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />On 16 September 2024, the summary trial of NSW Director Tim Xenos, former CEO and director of FAL Healthy Beverages Pty Ltd, commenced in Sydney.&nbsp; Mr Xenos has pleaded not guilty to charges that he was managing a company whilst disqualified, and dishonestly using his position as FAL Healthy Beverages CEO by inappropriately using approximately $170,826.95 in company funds to pay legal fees and other costs to annul his bankruptcy (refer&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-268mr-fal-healthy-beverages-director-charged-by-asic/" title="21-268MR FAL Healthy Beverages director charged by ASIC">21-268MR</a>).&nbsp; The trial concluded on 4 October 2024, and the Magistrate has reserved their decision.</p>
<h2>Assistance for external administration</h2>
<p>Registered liquidators can request assistance from ASIC in circumstances when directors, officers and individuals related to an entity in external administration fail to comply with legislative requirements, including the failure to provide books and records to the liquidator and the failure to complete a report on company activities and property (ROCAP).</p>
<p>During the period 1 July to 30 September 2024, ASIC successfully prosecuted 68 defendants for 123 offences for failing to assist liquidators, which resulted in fines of over $315,000.&nbsp; Proving the ROCAP as well as all company books and records, allows the liquidator to obtain better information about events leading up to their appointment and assist the liquidator in their investigations, asset recoveries, and complying with their obligations to report to creditors and to ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Section 206F of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;allows ASIC to disqualify a person from managing corporations for a maximum period of five years if, within a seven-year period, the person was an officer of two or more companies, and those companies were wound up and a liquidator provides a report to ASIC about each of the company&rsquo;s inability to pay its debts.</p>

<div> Treasury International Capital, TIC data, U.S. Department of Treasury, August 2024, foreign acquisitions
<br />
Summary:
Foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities increased, net TIC inflow of $79.2 billion, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills increased by $59.4 billion. Banks’ own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $97.9 billion. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for August 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for September 2024, is scheduled for November 18, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in August of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $79.2 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $79.7 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $0.6 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in August; their net purchases were $129.8 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $158.1 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $28.3 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $18.4 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $111.4 billion in August.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $59.4 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $65.7 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased&nbsp;by $97.9 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system</a></p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<p><span>Speaker:</span>&nbsp;Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive<br /><span>Event:</span>&nbsp;City Dinner, Mansion House<br /><span>Delivered:</span>&nbsp;17 October 2024<br /><br /></p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Growth is urgent but it has always been part of the FCA&rsquo;s story.</li>
<li>We are seeking answers about what more we can do to support capital formation, productivity gains and financial services exports.</li>
<li>The secondary growth objective is liberating and we are having a much needed, more candid conversation about our collective risk appetite.</li>
<li>We need to collaborate to deliver growth.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>As the prime minister said at Monday&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-international-investment-summit-speech-14-october-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="PM International Investment Summit Speech: 14 October 2024 | GOV.UK">investment summit<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, &ldquo;growth is the cause that binds us together&rdquo;. It is urgent.</p>
<p>In truth, growth has always been part of the FCA&rsquo;s story. Trusted, liquid markets. Consumers confidently engaging with products they need. Competition. Reduced financial crime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our longstanding work to support growth, now enshrined in law as a secondary objective.</p>
<p>We recognise that the jury is out on whether the FCA is helping to achieve growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take our annual firm survey. Increasingly positive on our delivery on consumer protection and market integrity. More ambivalent on our competition mandate. And weakest on international competitiveness and growth. Though 70% say we enhance the UK&rsquo;s standing as a financial centre. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We clearly have more to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how do we keep improving performance on primary objectives, whilst firing on all cylinders on the secondary, too? &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Literature review</h2>
<p>Our economists have published today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research-notes/growth-gap-literature-review-regulation-and-growth" title="The growth gap: a literature review of regulation and growth">literature review</a>&nbsp;on links between financial regulation and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A summary of existing research: a mile wide and an inch deep. It identifies not how much we know but, often, how little. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So we will shortly open a research competition to find the missing answers on how we can support:</p>
<ul>
<li>capital formation &nbsp;</li>
<li>productivity gains</li>
<li>financial services exports</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operational effectiveness</h2>
<p>While we seek those answers, we won&rsquo;t let up on our operational effectiveness &hellip; we know that matters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your predecessor raised authorisations 2 years ago &ndash; 98% of applications are now done within statutory deadlines. Our first application form is now fully digitised. More digitisation is coming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not perfect. But some firms now say they can&rsquo;t always keep up with us.</p>
<p>Same rigorous standards. More efficiency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more assertive against harm. 10,000 errant financial promotions tackled. Doubled cancellations of firms breaching minimum standards.</p>
<p>And we have more targeted enforcement. 9 successful fraud prosecutions and 21 charges last year &ndash; the most ever. A record 45 people facing proceedings.</p>
<p>Investigation times are falling &ndash; as low as 14 months in recent cases vs a 42-month average. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have proposed being more transparent on enforcement. Not in all cases. But no longer just by exception. Because our current approach doesn&rsquo;t work. We think a degree more openness can reduce harm, build whistleblower confidence and benefit firms that play by the rules.</p>
<p>We know the proposals came as a surprise, falling short of our &lsquo;predictability&rsquo; test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we have heard the strength of opposition and some concern that we could be an international outlier, detracting from competitiveness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to work through this together, mindful of all our objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next month, we will provide more data and case studies on how a public interest test could work in practice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is about firms, not individuals. We hope to reassure the sector &ndash; here and overseas &ndash; that relatively few cases would be affected, given so many are already disclosed, mostly by firms themselves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we decide to name a firm in the public interest, it wouldn&rsquo;t by default be when an investigation starts. Unlike in many jurisdictions, our enforcement investigations typically follow at least a year of supervisory engagement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We would give firms of all sizes longer to make representations about impact. And we know we have to be particularly mindful of impact on small firms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll continue to listen to feedback and our Board will decide early next year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, an FCA that tackles financial crime and deters serious misconduct reduces the drain on growth and competitiveness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have heard, too, industry concerns about data requests: number, scope, time to respond. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A lack of timely data featured in recent market issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>over-the-counter (OTC) trading in the nickel episode</li>
<li>clarity on leverage in the liability-driven investment (LDI) crisis</li>
<li>position information in August&rsquo;s yen carry trade unwind</li>
</ul>
<p>We now ingest 1 billion records a day, double a few years ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We all need to invest in technology to make it easier to share data and ease regulatory burdens. Our move to the cloud and use of large language models means we can analyse it quicker. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Digital infrastructure</h2>
<p>I understand Tom Cruise wants to go beyond the clouds and shoot his next film in space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Mr Cruise, I don&rsquo;t see the FCA&rsquo;s objectives as Mission Impossible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not if you are alongside us. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Johnson, whose calculations enabled NASA&rsquo;s first crewed spaceflights, observed: &ldquo;We always worked as a team...Never just one person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That collaborative approach is now needed more than ever &ndash; I will highlight 2 areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, infrastructure underpinning markets. There are bright sparks such as progress on tokenisation in asset management. But a collective execution deficit. Some boosters are not yet fully fired:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Smart Data Bill for the next phase of open banking</li>
<li>the National Payments Vision &nbsp;</li>
<li>timetables for T+1 settlement and share register dematerialisation</li>
<li>pensions dashboards</li>
<li>or, critically, a roadmap on identity authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>Others are pulling ahead, fast. They&rsquo;re overcoming vested interests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Government or regulatory action is not always needed. Rachel Kent recommended an investment research hub that requires neither. Just industry funding and leadership. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovate Finance calls for tech positive rather than tech neutral regulators. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s overcome national tech scepticism, and adopt an optimism which could tackle financial exclusion, as biometric identity has done from India to Sweden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our review of bereavement insurance claims shows far quicker payouts if electronic verification of death became the norm. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Risk appetite and regulatory reform</h2>
<p>We won&rsquo;t always get it right. We may back the wrong technology. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there really appetite for greater risk? We have shown we&rsquo;re up for it. Our far-reaching listing reforms are already being used. More radical reforms on prospectuses are readying for take-off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've published competitiveness metrics. Are policymakers willing to set metrics for tolerable failures to create conditions to unlock growth capital? We are a nation of improving savers, but bad investors. Credit to Barclays for shining a light on savers&rsquo; excess cash. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/advice-guidance-boundary-review" title="Advice Guidance Boundary Review">advice guidance boundary review</a>&nbsp;seeks innovation so people can access affordable support. But if that results in greater holdings in investments not cash, more will be at risk from short-term market volatility. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You have until Halloween to tell us how we can use the Consumer Duty to trim our rule book. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fewer tick boxes, less cost; no doubt welcome. But if we streamline disclosure, affordability or product rules, will firms be spooked if they have responsibility for outcomes without the comfort blanket of rules or guidance?</p>
<p>Outcomes-based regulation brings risk as well as opportunity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our history shows the value of risk taking. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A decade ago, the FCA launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/10-year-anniversary-fca-innovation-services" title="10 Year Anniversary: FCA Innovation Services">Project Innovate</a>&nbsp;&ndash; supporting firms trying new things. The FCA&rsquo;s competition objective spurred the idea &ndash; proof of our responsiveness to Parliament. Almost 1,000 firms have benefited. With firms that tested in our sandbox, 50% are more likely to attract capital. 95 foreign regulators have replicated it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re now launching an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab">AI Lab</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we go further still &hellip; will the market accept more risk?</p>
<p>Can we build on enhanced supervision for newly authorised firms with an L-plate for provisional authorisations &hellip; even if that means more firm failures, and increased Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) costs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>What if we bring promising startups together with venture capital? Would we be conflicted, in the event of future problems? &nbsp;</p>
<p>The secondary growth objective is liberating. We are now having a much-needed, more candid conversation about our collective risk appetite.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, Lord Mayor, lots done. Much more on its way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are now in 2024, not 2008. A shift in approach is underway.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t always all agree. But we should challenge one another on risks we&rsquo;re willing to accept for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foresight to invest for the long term, particularly in technology. Acceptance that that brings opportunities to succeed but also to fail. A shift in our public discourse when that happens. And ownership of outcomes we are seeking, leaving behind prescriptive rules.</p>
<p>In short, isn&rsquo;t it time to stop admiring the problems and execute solutions? To collaborate to deliver growth rather than compete for who&rsquo;s done best.</p>
<p>We ask for all your help, such that by next year when Mission Impossible 8 comes out, we can demonstrate that the FCA&rsquo;s mission impossible is, in fact, possible.</p>

- Economic recovery, domestic agenda, modern supply-side economics, global engagement, trade, climate change, national security, China relations, Russia conflict, Middle East stability. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you. Before our discussion, I&rsquo;d like to speak to the Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s international economic policy, which we&rsquo;ll continue to move forward next week at the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings. Our international economic policy has many objectives, including addressing critical challenges facing the entire globe. But I&rsquo;d like to especially focus today on how it complements our domestic economic agenda to benefit American businesses and families.</p>
<p>At home, our Administration has driven a historic economic recovery. U.S. GDP growth is strong, our unemployment rate is near historic lows, and inflation has declined significantly. We&rsquo;re now doing everything we can to lower costs for American families and pursuing a strategy I&rsquo;ve called modern supply-side economics, which aims to expand our economy&rsquo;s capacity to produce while reducing inequality. We&rsquo;ve seen record small business growth and a historic boom in factory construction led by facilities producing semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries. Productivity growth has been strong. More prime-age Americans are participating in our labor force than at any point over the past two decades. And we&rsquo;re reaching people and places that historically had not benefited from enough investment, supporting well-paying jobs for Americans without college degrees. America&rsquo;s strong economic performance is helping power the global economy, which remains resilient though progress across economies has been uneven.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just our actions at home that are supporting the global economy. But from the start of this Administration, President Biden and Vice President Harris have also charted a new course for America&rsquo;s international economic policy. We&rsquo;ve focused on stabilizing and strengthening relationships and working multilaterally, including because we believe that America&rsquo;s economic well-being depends on a global economy that&rsquo;s growing and secure. American businesses and families have a tremendous amount to gain from our connections to the global economy and from U.S. global economic leadership. We need to promote policies, investments, and institutions that support global growth, protect financial stability, and avoid economic instability. This includes tackling challenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility that threaten to hold back global growth and that will be high on the agenda at next week&rsquo;s meetings.</p>
<p>Calls for walling America off with high tariffs on friends and competitors alike or by treating even our closest allies as transactional partners are deeply misguided. Sweeping, untargeted tariffs would raise prices for American families and make our businesses less competitive. And we cannot even hope to advance our economic and security interests&mdash;such as opposing Russia&rsquo;s illegal invasion of Ukraine&mdash;if we go it alone. But the issues we face today, from broken supply chains, to climate change and global pandemic preparedness, to China&rsquo;s industrial overcapacity, also mean we cannot simply draw from an old playbook.</p>
<p>Let me explain how our approach is delivering the benefits of global growth to Americans, tackling global challenges, and countering threats to our competitiveness and national security.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>I. Delivering the Benefits of Global Growth to Americans</span></h3>
<p>Let me start with how our work helps Americans realize the benefits of global growth, including through trade and investment. Trade expands the market for our exports, from services to goods like transportation equipment and electronics; helps our producers efficiently source key inputs; and enables American consumers to access more goods at lower prices. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that more than 41 million American jobs depend on trade. American businesses also grow from investing abroad. And recent research finds that over 10 percent of U.S. employment could be directly or indirectly attributable to foreign direct investment in the United States.</p>
<p>Trade and investment also offer crucial pathways to greater economic security. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw American consumers and businesses pay the price of broken or overconcentrated supply chains: When the chips shortage forced temporary plant closures, companies lost revenue, workers lost wages, and families faced higher prices.</p>
<p>Our work to reinvigorate American manufacturing, including through the CHIPS and Science Act, is necessary. But it&rsquo;s not sufficient to realize the promise of trade and investment and to confront supply chain challenges. This requires strategic global engagement.</p>
<p>So, we led efforts to put in place a global minimum tax that will prevent a race to the bottom. It will also level the playing field for American businesses, providing us with more resources to invest at home.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re strengthening our supply chains through an approach I&rsquo;ve called friendshoring, which aims to bolster ties with a wide range of trusted allies and partners.</p>
<p>We and partners launched the Minerals Security Partnership to accelerate the development of critical minerals supply chains. We negotiated a critical minerals agreement with Japan and a supply chain agreement with Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity partner countries. We&rsquo;re supporting the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement and working with the Inter-American Development Bank to find opportunities to enhance competitiveness and support key supply chains in Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity countries. We&rsquo;re leveraging the CHIPS and Science Act to pursue partnerships to diversify the global semiconductor ecosystem. And last May, we took another step forward by launching the Nairobi-Washington Vision to accelerate investments toward clean and resilient economies and supply chains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the fruits of our engagement in my travels as Treasury Secretary, from an American company processing lithium in Chile to a U.S.-funded job training facility in South Africa, among many other examples. Through our global engagements, we&rsquo;re strengthening economies around the world. And we&rsquo;re growing American businesses and creating American jobs, supporting American consumers, and increasing our country&rsquo;s economic security.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>II. Tackling Global Challenges</span></h3>
<p>America&rsquo;s economic future, however, also depends on tackling challenges that cross borders to affect people and economies around the world, including the American people and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with pandemics. No matter what we do at home, without addressing critical gaps in the global health infrastructure to strengthen global preparedness, preparation, and response, a future pandemic could negatively impact many economies, with significant spillovers to ours.</p>
<p>So, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked with fellow finance and health ministers to take actions like launching the Pandemic Fund. It was set up and scaled in record time and is now allocating desperately needed resources in response to its second call for proposals to support countries across the globe, in turn making Americans safer and more secure.</p>
<p>Climate change is another powerful example. The destruction we&rsquo;ve seen this hurricane season in the United States is the latest reminder of the need for bold action. At home, our actions include fueling the transition to clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act, developing Principles for Net-Zero Financing and Investment to affirm the importance of credible net-zero commitments, and addressing the risks climate change poses to U.S. financial stability. But emissions everywhere around the globe contribute to climate change. And we&rsquo;re impacted by increasingly severe and frequent climate-related events, wherever they occur. Damage to infrastructure abroad affects the availability and prices of energy and agricultural goods like coffee and cacao. We suffer from smoke from wildfires in Canada and from precarious shared water resources with Mexico. And the potential risks climate change poses to global financial stability are increasingly widely recognized as well. This means that helping countries around the world mitigate and adapt and financial institutions globally pursue transition finance is crucial, including to protect American businesses and families.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve made a massive push as part our multilateral development bank evolution agenda to better equip the MDBs to help countries address climate change, including through increasing climate financing. We&rsquo;ve worked with partners to launch Just Energy Transition Partnerships to help countries accelerate their transitions and strengthen their economies. We&rsquo;ve pursued bilateral efforts like the partnership we launched with Brazil&rsquo;s Fazenda in July and are working multilaterally, such as through the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group. And we&rsquo;ve been focused on harnessing the private sector, including through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program.</p>
<p>Alongside pandemics and climate change, conflict and fragility abroad also pose risks, to countries around the world and to America&rsquo;s economy and national security, so we&rsquo;re engaging on these challenges as well, including through the MDB evolution agenda.</p>
<p>Nor do risks to financial stability respect national borders, making the work of the Financial Stability Board and other global collaboration critical to ensuring a safe, stable, effective financial system and protecting the global and U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Put simply, in engaging to support countries around the world in tackling today&rsquo;s greatest challenges, we also lower the likelihood of negative spillovers to the U.S. economy like weakened markets for our exports and increased instability. The scale and nature of these challenges mean there is no alternative but to engage.</p>
<h3><span>III. Countering Threats to our Competitiveness and National Security</span></h3>
<p>Let me end by emphasizing a third way in which our global engagement supports Americans: bolstering our competitiveness and national security, including through our approach to China.</p>
<p>Trade and investment with China can bring significant gains to American firms and workers and must be maintained. But we must also have a healthy economic relationship based on a level playing field. China&rsquo;s barriers to market access and unfair trade practices currently cause challenges for American firms and workers and for other foreign businesses looking to operate in China. China&rsquo;s policies are also leading to industrial overcapacity in critical industries, threatening the viability of American and other firms and increasing the risk of overconcentrated supply chains that undermine global economic resilience.</p>
<p>No matter how much we invest to strengthen our manufacturing at home, we cannot support American businesses and families without also engaging to address these challenges. The United States announced strategic and targeted steps in key sectors as a result of the Section 301 review to respond to unfair trade practices by the PRC. The European Union and emerging market countries have also taken or are exploring actions. I&rsquo;ve raised concerns about overcapacity frequently and directly with my Chinese counterparts, including on multiple trips to China, and with America&rsquo;s allies and partners, who share these concerns and are also responding. This growing international consensus is a powerful indication to China that it must shift its practices.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s war on Ukraine has also revealed the necessity of strategic global engagement. Russia&rsquo;s invasion caused immediate economic shocks, like record gas prices in June of 2022. At home, releasing barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and record domestic oil and natural gas production helped address our short-term needs. But this would not have been enough to keep global energy markets well-supplied, nor to oppose the threat Putin&rsquo;s actions pose to the rules-based international order that underlies the strength of the global economy and the international financial system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we formed a strong coalition and put in place a novel price cap, helping keep prices lower for American and global consumers than many economists forecast following the invasion. We&rsquo;ve continued to strengthen sanctions that constrict Russia&rsquo;s ability to wage war. We&rsquo;re working towards unlocking the value of Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine. This sustained, global action allows us to accomplish what we could not alone, delivering immediate results and sending the clear message that dictators like Putin do not operate with impunity. Failing to engage or not engaging strategically would have disastrous effects, enabling Putin to destabilize Europe and undermining our collective security and the global economy.</p>
<p>In the coming months, we will continue to be focused on these and other priorities, including using all the tools at our disposal in response to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We&rsquo;ve imposed sanctions on terrorist actors including Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah. And we&rsquo;re also working to increase stability in the region by ensuring that legitimate aid flows reach Gaza and pressing for measures to support the West Bank economy.</p>
<h3><span>IV. Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>Over the past four years, the world has been through a lot: from a once-in-a-century pandemic, to the largest land war in Europe since World War II, to increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters. This has only underlined that we are all in it together. America&rsquo;s economic well-being depends on the world&rsquo;s, and America&rsquo;s economic leadership is key to global prosperity and security. American isolationism and retrenchment will leave all of us worse off.</p>
<p>I am convinced that there is simply no other path forward than the one we will continue pursuing next week and in the months ahead: strategic international economic policy that delivers for American families and businesses and others around the world.</p>
<p>I now very much look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> Panels, AI, sustainable finance, ESAs, consumer protection<br />
Summary:<br />
The 11th Annual Consumer Protection Day organized by ESAs in Budapest covered topics on AI in financial services, access to consumer-centric products, and sustainable finance. Industry leaders discussed the potential benefits and risks of AI, as well as the need to better understand the technology. Additionally, the discussion focused on the need for regulators to simplify sustainable finance disclosures and enhance the financial literacy of retail investors. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>On 3 October, the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) &ndash; the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) &ndash; organised the 11th edition of their annual Consumer Protection Day, in Budapest.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The event followed the theme of &ldquo;Empowering EU consumers: fair access to the future of financial services&rdquo; and had three panels covering the topics of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services, access to consumer centric products and services, and sustainable finance. Speakers and panellists included leaders from consumer organisations, regulatory authorities, EU institutions, academia, and market participants from across the European Union, with 300 participants on-site and more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z39IPuFKEY&amp;t=5s">600 viewers&nbsp;online</a>.</p>
<p>Speeches were delivered by the three ESAs Chairs &ndash; Verena Ross (ESMA and currently Joint Committee Chair), Jose-Manuel Campa (EBA), and Petra Hielkema (EIOPA) &ndash; as well as Csaba Kandr&aacute;cs, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Hungary and Agust&iacute;n Reyna, the Director General of the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC). A fire-side chat also took place with Chris Betz, Chief Information Security Officer of Amazon Web services to discuss generative AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;<span>Artificial Intelligence</span>, panellists exchanged views about the potential benefits of AI, such as fraud detection and the automation of processes to detect and prevent money laundering, as well as the risks, such as the lack of transparency and explainability. Panellists emphasised the need to better understand the technology to assess how those risks can be mitigated. Some panellists highlighted the importance for the ESAs to facilitate knowledge sharing, ensure regulatory and supervisory convergence and create the conditions for innovation to grow. Some industry players also called on the ESAs to issue &lsquo;guardrails&rsquo; or other guidance on how financial institutions should comply with the new EU AI Act.</p>
<p><a>During the panel on&nbsp;<span>access to consumer centric financial products and services</span>, panellists discussed the need to&nbsp;strengthen &nbsp;financial education, pay greater attention to vulnerable consumers, and enable them to understand and access standard financial services packages (payment account, saving account, home/health insurance). The importance&nbsp;of better&nbsp;understanding consumer needs and preserve consumer trust was also highlighted.</a></p>
<p>On&nbsp;<span>sustainable finance</span>,&nbsp;panellists remarked that investors still struggle to understand the technicalities of&nbsp; product disclosures and the complex terminology attached to such disclosures. Simplification of the current Sustainable Finance Disclosures Requirements towards a categorisation system that works for retail investors was considered by the panellists to be the main area that regulators should focus on,&nbsp;&nbsp;in addition to enhancing the financial literacy of retail investors.</p>

<title>EDHEC Infra &amp; Private Assets Research Institute Strongly Supportive Of ILPA’s Initiative To Enhance Transparency In Private Markets</title>

<div> transparency, performance, valuation, benchmarking, private markets
Summary:
EIPA supports ILPA's initiative for transparency & improved performance reporting in private markets. Standardised valuation and benchmarking guidelines are recommended. The proposed Quarterly Reporting Standards Initiative is commendable.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>In an <a href="https://publishing.edhecinfra.com/open+letters/comments_ILPA_111024.pdf">open letter</a> in response to the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) <a href="https://ilpa.org/industry-guidance/templates-standards-model-documents/ilpa-quarterly-reporting-standards-initiative/">consultation on its reporting and performance templates</a>, the EDHEC Infra &amp; Private Assets Research Institute (EIPA) has expressed strong support for the ILPA&rsquo;s initiative to enhance transparency by improving performance and reporting disclosures in private markets.</p>
<p>EIPA also commented that a standardised valuation approach that brings the focus back to asset-level information could provide strong foundations to improve benchmarking practices. Transparent and objective factor-model-based valuations can reduce gaming of the valuation and also provide private-market-specific return proxies. A first step in this direction could be for ILPA to recommend benchmarking guidelines that restrict the degrees of freedom in comparing performance, such as proposing standardised definitions of metrics, objective identification of peer groups, and increased information about comparisons. Moreover, ILPA could insist on using private market-specific indices as a reference for comparison.</p>
<p>Commenting on the open letter, Frederic Blanc-Brude, Director of EIPA, said, &ldquo;The introduction of disclosures about subscription lines in the performance template and the increased detail on fees in the reporting template, as part of the proposed Quarterly Reporting Standards Initiative, are commendable. We believe these changes will enable LPs to make more informed decisions in private markets. Furthermore, these templates set a high standard, and their adoption by GPs can substantially improve private market investing.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Tanga UWASA Brings East Africa’s First Subnational Green Bond To LuxSE</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tanga-uwasa-brings-east-africas-first-subnational-green-bond-to-luxse/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Luxembourg Stock Exchange, Tanga UWASA, green bond, sustainable finance, Tanzania<br />
Summary:<br />
Tanzanian water authority Tanga UWASA listed a pioneering green bond on Luxembourg Stock Exchange with support from UNCDF. It aims to fund water infrastructure and environmental projects, attracting both domestic and international investors. This demonstrates the importance of subnational entities in accessing capital market financing and promoting sustainable development in Tanzania. <div>
<p>During a visit by a Tanzanian delegation to Luxembourg which included representatives of the country&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Water and other public authorities, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) and Tanga UWASA celebrated the listing of the Tanzania-based water authority&rsquo;s pioneering green bond on LuxSE. The bond is displayed on the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX), the world&rsquo;s reference platform for sustainable securities.</p>
<p>This historic achievement was made possible through the critical support and coordination of the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), which played a pivotal role as the lead development finance advisor and technical partner to Tanga UWASA throughout the entire bond issuance process. UNCDF's support included project development, raising national awareness, creating and financing the issuance roadmap, and developing innovative risk mitigation strategies tailored to the Tanzanian market. This project serves as a model for UNCDF's efforts to develop sustainable finance mechanisms across East Africa and beyond.</p>
<p><b>Accessing global investors</b></p>
<p>The TZS 53 billion bond, equivalent to EUR 17.8 million, is the first green bond to be issued by a public institution in East Africa. It has a 10-year maturity and aims to finance water infrastructure projects and environmental conservation initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we appreciate that LuxSE is a place where ideas meet capital, become reality and create real impact; we aspire for our future Tanzanian issuers &ndash; both public and private sector &ndash; to access Luxembourg markets, get connected with a pool of global investors, raise capital, and drive growth. In other words, we would want to see more subnational, corporate, and even sovereign debt products listed in Luxembourg. We are developing a pipeline of transactions to facilitate this positive trend of sustainability investments; and remain committed to improving our country&rsquo;s enabling environment to attract foreign investors and private sector,&rdquo; said Dr. Mwigulu Lameck Nchemba, Hon Minister of Finance for Tanzania.</p>
<p><b>Transforming access to water in Tanzania</b></p>
<p>The bond, which was open to both domestic and international investors, was met with great interest when issued earlier this year, and twice oversubscribed. Around 65% of the funding came from domestic investors while 35% came from international investors. This is seen as an indication of the growing interest of the international investor community in sustainable investment opportunities in Tanzania. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuance highlights the important role subnational entities such as Tanga UWASA can play in unlocking capital market financing in local currency to fund sustainable development projects in Tanzania. The proceeds of the bond will go towards propelling thousands of households' access to safe and affordable water in the East African country and protecting the natural resources of the nation's famous Zigi river, among other key environmental projects.</p>
<p>The Managing Director of Tanga UWASA, Eng. Geofrey Hilly, emphasised that, &ldquo;the listing of our green bond on LuxSE, underscores the utility&rsquo;s commitment to advancing sustainable water services to our customers while remain a pioneer and an excellent model for replication by other public entities. We are thankful to all our investors and partners who supported our transaction, and we reaffirm our assurance in meeting applicable standards including our investment obligations.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mobilising capital for sustainable development</b></p>
<p>With 44,000+ listed securities, LuxSE is the world&rsquo;s leading exchange for the listing of international bonds, serving 1,800 issuers across 100 countries. Since establishing LGX in 2016, LuxSE has focused on advancing the sustainable finance agenda across the world. Over the past few years, LuxSE has established cooperation agreements with selected exchanges in Africa and worked with market participants to help foster sustainable finance initiatives on the continent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Access to safe and affordable water and sanitation is a key factor in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the very foundation of health and safety. We are delighted to mark the listing of this pioneering green bond from Tanga UWASA on our exchange, it is a great illustration of the role that international capital markets play in mobilising financing to secure access to essential services for everyone,&rdquo;<i> </i>said Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<p><b>Collaborating for sustainability</b></p>
<p>Tanga UWASA, which was established in the historic city of Tanga in 1998, plays a key role in supplying sufficient, clean and safe water to Tanga City, Muheza and Pangani Townships residents and safely collecting and disposing of sewage in compliance with both environmental and health standards.</p>
<p>The bond issuance, which is hoped to pave the way for other such issuances in the region, is the result of close collaboration between the subnational entity, the country&rsquo;s Finance and Water Ministries, its Capital Market and Securities Authority and the UNCDF, among other key players.</p>
<p>"The successful issuance and cross-listing of the Tanga Water Bond demonstrates UNCDF's commitment to promoting sustainable finance and developing domestic capital markets in Tanzania," said Peter Malika, Head of UNCDF Tanzania. "Our team has worked tirelessly to coordinate the National Municipal and Subnational Bond Stakeholders Taskforce, which was instrumental in launching this first national pilot. This bond issuance is part of UNCDF's ongoing commitment to unlock domestic capital for sustainable development in Tanzania. Moreover, UNCDF's work has contributed to improving the regulatory environment for subnational bond issuances in Tanzania, paving the way for future similar initiatives."</p>

<div> Machine Learning AI, fraud prevention, improper payments, Treasury, fiscal service <br />
<br />
The U.S. Department of the Treasury used enhanced processes, including machine learning AI, to prevent and recover over $4 billion in fraud and improper payments. Partnered with federal agencies for data access. Treasury is proactive, preventing $4 billion in fraud and improper payments using advanced technology and data-driven approaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><em>Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Payment Integrity Began Using Enhanced Processes, including Machine Learning AI, to Deal with Increased Fraud and Improper Payments Since the Pandemic</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that its latest efforts in taking a technology and data-driven approach to fraud and improper payment prevention enabled the prevention and recovery of over $4 billion in fraud and improper payments this fiscal year (FY) (October 2023 &ndash; September 2024), up from $652.7 million in FY23. This increase reflects dedicated efforts by Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Payment Integrity (OPI), within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) to enhance its fraud prevention capabilities and expand offerings to new and existing customers.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding risk-based screening resulting in $500 million in prevention.</li>
<li>Identifying and prioritizing high-risk transactions resulting in $2.5 billion in prevention.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Expediting the identification of Treasury check fraud with machine learning AI resulting in $1 billion in recovery.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Implementing efficiencies in payment processing schedule resulting in $180 million in prevention.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury takes seriously our responsibility to serve as effective stewards of taxpayer money. Helping ensure that agencies pay the right person, in the right amount, at the right time is central to our efforts,&rdquo; said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made significant progress during the past year in preventing over $4 billion in fraudulent and improper payments. We will continue to partner with others in the federal government to equip them with the necessary tools, data, and expertise they need to stop improper payments and fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to enhanced capabilities, Treasury is focused on establishing and strengthening partnerships with new and high-risk programs to increase access to and usage of Treasury&rsquo;s payment integrity solutions, including federally-funded state administered programs. For instance, in May 2024, Treasury and the Department of Labor announced<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2650#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/eta/eta20240502-1">a data-sharing partnership</a>&nbsp;to provide state unemployment agencies with access to Do Not Pay Working System data sources and services through the Unemployment Insurance Integrity Data Hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the federal government&rsquo;s central disbursing agency, Treasury securely disburses approximately 1.4 billion payments valued at over $6.9 trillion dollars to more than 100 million people annually. At a time when losses from fraud in the financial sector continue to rise every year, with online payment fraud expected to cumulatively surpass $362 billion by 2028<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2650#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>, Treasury is uniquely positioned to support federal programs proactively mitigate the risk of financial fraud by leveraging data and emerging technologies.</p>

<title>G7 Cyber Expert Group Recommends Action To Combat Financial Sector Risks From Quantum Computing</title>

<div> quantum computing, cybersecurity risks, financial sector, encryption standards, G7 CEG <br />
Summary: 
The G7 Cyber Expert Group highlights quantum computing risks for the financial sector and recommends steps to mitigate the risks. They urge entities to understand, assess, and develop plans for quantum resilience. <br /> <div>
<p><span>G7 Cyber Expert Group publishes guidance for the finance sector on planning for quantum computing.</span></p>
<p>The G7 Cyber Expert Group (CEG) - chaired by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England - released a public statement on 25 September highlighting the potential cybersecurity risks associated with developments in quantum computing and recommending steps for financial authorities and institutions to take to address those risks.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p><span class="gem-c-attachment-link"><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6710f86e9cd657734653d713/G7-CYBER-EXPERT-GROUP-STATEMENT-PLANNING-OPPORTUNITIES-RISKS-QUANTUM-COMPUTING.pdf">G7 Cyber Expert Group statement on planning for the opportunities and risks of quantum computing</a>&nbsp;(<span class="gem-c-attachment-link__attribute"><abbr class="gem-c-attachment-link__abbr" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr></span>,&nbsp;<span class="gem-c-attachment-link__attribute">483 KB</span>,&nbsp;<span class="gem-c-attachment-link__attribute">3 pages</span>)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Quantum computers are being built that will be able to solve computational problems currently deemed impossible for conventional computers to solve within a reasonable amount of time. &nbsp;While potentially providing significant benefits to the financial system, these powerful computers will also carry with them unique cybersecurity risks. &nbsp;One of the most significant is that cyber threat actors could use quantum computers to defeat certain cryptographic techniques that secure communications and IT systems, potentially exposing financial entity data, including customer information.</p>
<p>While the exact timeline for developing quantum computers with these capabilities is uncertain, there is a real possibility that such capabilities could emerge within a decade. These quantum computers would not only put future data at risk, but also any previously transmitted data that cyber adversaries have been able to intercept and store with the intent of decrypting later with quantum computers.&nbsp;Due to the potentially long lead time needed to put in place quantum-resilient technologies, the time to start planning is now.</p>
<p>An initial set of quantum-resilient encryption standards was released by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) last month. Additional standards from NIST and other standard-setting bodies are expected in the future. It is important for financial entities to maintain the agility required to incorporate new encryption standards in a timely and appropriate manner as they become available.</p>
<p>With the availability of NIST&rsquo;s standards, some financial entities may be in a position now to start making the needed changes to implement quantum resilient technologies within their systems. Others may be dependent on vendors and other third parties to develop implementations of the new standards that can be incorporated once they become available. No matter where entities are in their adoption timelines, the G7 CEG strongly encourages financial authorities and institutions to begin taking the following steps to build resilience against quantum computing risks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop a better understanding of the issue, the risks involved, and strategies for mitigating those risks.</li>
<li>Assess quantum computing risks in their areas of responsibility.</li>
<li>Develop a plan for mitigating quantum computing risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The CEG statement provides additional details on quantum computing risks and the specific actions that financial entities can start taking to build quantum resilience within the financial system.</p>
<p>The G7 CEG&rsquo;s membership includes representatives of financial authorities across all G7 jurisdictions as well as the European Central Bank.&nbsp; It was founded in 2015 to serve as a multi-year working group that coordinates cybersecurity policy and strategy across the member jurisdictions. &nbsp;In addition to policy coordination, the G7 CEG also acts as a vehicle for information sharing, cooperation, and incident response.</p>

Summary:<br /><br />Cboe and S&amp;P DJI launch VIXEQ Index measuring implied volatility of S&amp;P 500 stocks, aims to provide insight into market volatility. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The VIXEQ Index is a direct component in the calculation of the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index</li>
<li>New index aims to measure the market cap weighted 30-day implied volatility of a basket of S&amp;P 500 constituent stocks</li>
<li>Furthers Cboe's and S&amp;P DJI's efforts to provide insight into market volatility and implied dispersion</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (S&amp;P DJI), the world's leading index provider, today announced plans to launch the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Constituent Volatility Index (VIXEQ Index), calculated by Cboe Global Indices. Using an adaptation of Cboe's proprietary VIX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Index methodology, the VIXEQ<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;Index is designed to measure the market cap weighted 30-day implied volatility of a basket of S&amp;P 500 constituents, as represented by the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Basket Index (DSPBX Index). The announcement was made by Cboe and S&amp;P DJI at Cboe's 39<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;annual global Risk Management Conference (RMC), currently taking place in Snowbird, Utah.</p>
<p>Cboe and S&amp;P DJI launched the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX Index) in September 2023 to provide the market a measure of expected dispersion in the S&amp;P 500 Index over the next 30 calendar days. The DSPX Index is designed to give investors a view of S&amp;P 500 Index moves relative to its constituent companies, providing investors with visibility into potential opportunities for portfolio diversification. The DSPX Index calculation is derived from prices of S&amp;P 500 Index options and the single stock options of the S&amp;P 500 Index's constituent companies.</p>
<p>The VIXEQ Index, which is expected to launch Monday, November 4, follows the launch of the DSPX Index and is developed based on the DSPBX Index. The DSPBX Index provides the representative universe of large-cap U.S. equities conducive to the DSPX Index calculation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Since providing the industry with a first-of-its-kind forward-looking dispersion measure last year, Cboe and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices have been working to provide more insight into the relationship between the S&amp;P 500 Index and single stock volatility, while expanding the utility of our implied dispersion indices," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "When referenced alongside Cboe's volatility index suite, including our VIX Index and DSPX Index, the VIXEQ Index can help investors better understand dispersion opportunities and market volatility expectations. Cboe continues to strive to provide market participants the tools and measures needed in an evolving market."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the VIX Index measures implied volatility by using SPX options prices, the VIXEQ Index will be based on single stock options prices. For each eligible S&amp;P 500 constituent, as determined by the DSPBX Index, a VIX-like calculation is performed, and the results are then weighted by their market cap in the DSPBX Index. The market cap weighted equity variance calculations are summed and converted to the VIXEQ Index value.</p>
<p>"As an index provider, S&amp;P DJI is dedicated to continuing to establish standards that help market participants understand and measure volatility," said Tim Brennan, Global Head of Capital Markets at S&amp;P DJI. "We expect VIXEQ to provide a more refined glimpse into the volatility of the individual constituents within the world's most liquid equity benchmark. This latest collaboration between S&amp;P DJI and Cboe speaks to the importance and acceptance of volatility tools more broadly and continues to underscore the S&amp;P 500's ongoing strength as the best single gauge of the U.S. equity market."</p>

<title>ECB Monetary Policy Decisions</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ecb-monetary-policy-decisions-25/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> interest rates, inflation outlook, monetary policy, asset purchase programme, refinancing operations
<br />
The ECB lowered interest rates to combat disinflation and restrictive financing conditions. They will continue asset purchases and monitor refinancing operations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate &ndash; the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance &ndash; is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity. Meanwhile, financing conditions remain restrictive.</p>
<p>Inflation is expected to rise in the coming months, before declining to target in the course of next year. Domestic inflation remains high, as wages are still rising at an elevated pace. At the same time, labour cost pressures are set to continue easing gradually, with profits partially buffering their impact on inflation.</p>
<p>The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.</p>
<h2>Key ECB interest rates</h2>
<p>The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal lending facility will be decreased to 3.25%, 3.40% and 3.65% respectively, with effect from 23 October 2024.</p>
<h2>Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)</h2>
<p>The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.</p>
<p>The Eurosystem no longer reinvests all of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP, reducing the PEPP portfolio by &euro;7.5 billion per month on average. The Governing Council intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Refinancing operations</h2>
<p>As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.</p>
<p>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today.</p>

Summary: FCA celebrates 10th anniversary, highlights progress in FinTech, launches AI Lab, emphasizes partnership, supports innovation, and focuses on AI's future. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><a class="copy-block-image__image" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/images/jessica-rusu-speech.jpg"><img src="https://www.fca.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/no_style/public/media/images/jessica-rusu-speech.jpg?itok=vCksEEEw" /></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Speaker: Jessica Rusu, Chief Data, Information and Intelligence Officer&nbsp;<br />Event:&nbsp;FCA 10th anniversary event<br />Delivered: 17 October 2024</p>
<h2 lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Highlights&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re launching an AI Lab. The AI Lab adds a new AI-specific focus to our Innovation services.</li>
<li>10 years ago, we became the first financial regulator in the world to launch a regulatory sandbox. We are celebrating our impact as well as the UK&rsquo;s leading global position in FinTech and innovation in financial services.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Since then, we have supported almost 1,000 firms and over 95 other regulators have introduced a sandbox model.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a minute to take you back to 10 years ago. The Lego Movie was one of the biggest movies of the year, streaming data was included in the singles charts for the first time, and no one could escape clapping their hands to Pharell Williams and 'Happy'.</p>
<p>And in the UK, the FinTech market was still in its infancy, estimated to be worth around &pound;5-6 billion, with less than 1000 firms active. In August 2014, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced the UK Government&rsquo;s ambition to make the UK the 'global capital of FinTech'.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation" title="FCA Innovation Hub">Project Innovate</a>&nbsp;was made up of 2 people based in our previous Canary Wharf offices. The landscape of UK financial services and FinTech were drastically different. So, what&rsquo;s changed?</p>
<p>As of 2023, the UK FinTech market has exploded, reaching a value of around &pound;30 billion. Furthermore, we&rsquo;ve seen the number of FinTechs in the UK more than treble to over 3000 today.</p>
<p>In 2023, while the US saw FinTech deals worth over $24 billion take place, the UK did come in second place with over $5 billion. Last year, capital secured by the UK was greater than the next 28 European countries combined - something to really celebrate. I believe that our support for sustainable growth and innovation has contributed to that success.</p>
<p>And what about that support? Since 2014, Project Innovate has grown and evolved. No longer driving the innovation agenda alone, it now sits in its own department in an expanded division, with data, digital intelligence, product development and technology.</p>
<p>The Data, Technology and Innovation (DTI) division, which I&rsquo;ve led since 2021, is responsible for supporting innovation not only in industry but also for delivering regulatory solutions to help the FCA deliver against its ambitions, leveraging the power of data and technology. Innovation is now over 30 colleagues, with many more right across the FCA supporting technology and innovation.</p>
<p>Our Innovation services now has an expanded offering, including our world-first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/regulatory-sandbox" title="Regulatory Sandbox">Regulatory Sandbox</a>&nbsp;which has been replicated by over 95 global and domestic regulators. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/innovation-pathways" title="Innovation Pathways">Innovation Pathways</a>&nbsp;services have helped guide firms through the complexities of regulation and our processes.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years we&rsquo;ve supported almost 1000 firms serving UK consumers. Through our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/techsprints" title="TechSprints">TechSprints</a>, we used our convening power to bring communities and expert collaborators together to find solutions to the biggest challenges in financial services using technology and innovation, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/events/authorised-push-payment-fraud-techsprint" title="Authorised Push Payment Fraud TechSprint">Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud</a>&nbsp;and tackling money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PolicySprints soon followed. Through discussion and exploration by bringing experts together, this novel approach assists in informing our thinking on various topics, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-information">Crypto</a>&nbsp;to Open Finance, allowing for more dynamic policy considerations and creation, and informing potential future regulation.</p>
<p>We have recognised that innovation and emerging technologies know no borders. They are global in nature, requiring an international approach. For this reason, we created the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/global-financial-innovation-network" title="Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)">Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)</a>&nbsp;in 2019, and since then we have continued to invest in growing this global community to now more than 90 regulators. Global markets mean that global events have an impact on the UK financial market, impacting volatility and bringing about potentially stormy waters.</p>
<p>Through that time, we&rsquo;ve tasked ourselves with a critical responsibility - to help steer the ship through both calm and rougher seas. Whether that be helping firms navigate the choppy waters of product development, or the sunshine and fair winds of investment booms.</p>
<p>We endeavour to ensure beneficial innovation can flourish while maintaining our commitment to safeguarding consumers and the stability of the financial system. We&rsquo;re creating the right environment for firms to flourish and grow, and for the UK to remain a great place to be an innovator.</p>
<h3>Partnership</h3>
<p>One of the key factors in our success over the past decade has been the strong partnership between industry and regulator. As many of you know, the role of a regulator is often misunderstood.</p>
<p>Some see us as gatekeepers, others as enforcers. A wall, or teachers with red pens. And, in truth, we are at times all of those things. But our role is more nuanced, more holistic. Especially with innovation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about creating an environment for sustainable growth, fostering competition, and ensuring that consumers get the best outcomes, and markets benefit from advancements in the long term. Here, we are not barriers to progress. We aren&rsquo;t a wall, we&rsquo;re a bridge. Partners in helping shape and support beneficial innovation.</p>
<p>Innovation plays a vital role in growth and competitiveness of UK financial services. Another thing that&rsquo;s changed in the last 10 years is the addition of our secondary international competitiveness and growth objective. Our Innovation services play a key role in helping us realise our vision for the future.</p>
<p>Our commitment to innovation isn&rsquo;t just rhetoric. We&rsquo;ve witnessed, and supported, huge growth in the financial sector. Firms have brought forward new solutions to old problems, sometimes through our TechSprints, our Sandboxes, or through our Innovation Pathways. Helping to improve financial inclusion, drive efficiency, and better serve customers.</p>
<p>Firms for example, like&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.zilch.com/uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zilch<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, a buy-now-pay-later service for retail customers. In 2019, Zilch launched their beta product, and were accepted into our Regulatory Sandbox, finalising testing and exiting it in 2020, becoming fully FCA authorised not long after.</p>
<p>Since then, Zilch has raised over &pound;11m investment, reached 3 million customers, and become profitable on a per transaction basis. We have seen them go from strength to strength to become one of the most successful UK unicorns. The sandbox provided Zilch with the support and live environment to test their solutions in line with regulated activities in the consumer credit space.</p>
<p>We also supported&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.finexos.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Finexos<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, who are addressing financial inclusion and credit poverty issues through provision of enhanced risk detection tools to credit providers.</p>
<p>Through application of AI, behavioural analytics and real-time data, they aim to reduce risk, costs, and default rates, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. In our Digital Sandbox, Finexos were able to develop and test this next generation of credit risk analysis, using open banking to assess a timeline of borrower&rsquo;s financial capabilities, with an analytics focus on affordability, probability, and suitability, to create a fairer financial landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this work is, in part, due to the collaborative efforts between regulators, incumbents, and new entrants, alike. Our innovation initiatives have been a resource and a launchpad, working hand in hand with firms to deliver the necessary steers for innovation and growth.</p>
<p>In fact, an&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://academic.oup.com/rof/article-abstract/28/1/203/7140150?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" rel="noopener" target="_blank">independent study<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;found that FCA sandbox firms are 50% more likely to raise funding than their peers, and on average raise 15% more in investment.</p>
<p>Feedback from firms on their experiences with our Innovation Services also support our role as a facilitator. Many say they don&rsquo;t think their company or product would have been able to scale up or mature in the same way if they hadn&rsquo;t engaged with us, whether through our TechSprints or our sandboxes.</p>
<p>Even firms that didn&rsquo;t make it through the application stage for our sandboxes tell us how helpful we were. Our last firm survey found that 50% of firms whose applications were unsuccessful still rated our Innovation services as useful for their business development thanks to our engagement and signposting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our 10th anniversary celebrations, we are today publishing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/10-year-anniversary-fca-innovation-services" title="10 Year Anniversary: FCA Innovation Services">Lookback Repor</a>t, which includes detail on the depth and breadth of our services and support we&rsquo;ve provided to firms across the financial services landscape over the past decade.</p>
<h3>Future of AI in financial services</h3>
<p>Whilst we should look back over the last 10 years, and celebrate our successes, we are actively working on the future. Our work is far from done, and if anything, the pace of innovation is only accelerating. New challenges and opportunities are emerging on the horizon.</p>
<p>One of the most transformative of these is AI. AI will revolutionise financial services, providing solutions to improve consumer financial inclusion, help prevent market abuse, and support the delivery of new products and services. And whilst we are just starting to see AI&rsquo;s benefits emerge, we are clear that those benefits do not come without risks.</p>
<p>As a regulator, we must play a critical role in ensuring AI is deployed in a way that is safe, fair and in the best interests of consumers and the market as a whole. Even some of the world&rsquo;s most profusive backers of AI recognise the importance of ensuring the risks of AI are mitigated, as we all work to realise the undoubtedly enormous benefits the technology has to offer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why AI is a priority for us. We are committed to enabling a safe and responsible environment for the beneficial use of AI in UK financial markets, in a way that supports the growth and competitiveness of the sector.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to working alongside industry leaders, academia, consumer groups, Government and fellow regulators to explore how AI can be safely and effectively integrated into financial services.</p>
<p>This includes our work with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-operate/who-work-with/drcf" title="Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum">Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF)</a>, with whom we launched an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/data-analytics-artificial-intelligence-ai" title="Data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI)">AI &amp; Digital Hub</a>&nbsp;in April this year, for innovators looking for cross-sectoral guidance on AI solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/ai-update.pdf" title="ai-update.pdf">AI Update</a>, published in April 2024, we reiterated our principles-based and outcomes-focused approach to AI, including how many of the associated risks can be mitigated within our existing outcomes-based regulatory frameworks, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/senior-managers-certification-regime" title="Senior Managers and Certification Regime ">Senior Managers &amp; Certification Regime</a>, while supporting beneficial innovation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking an evidence-based approach to AI. We have previously conducted two Machine Learning surveys taking stock of the use of the use of the technology in the sector. As AI has continued to expand in use, we&rsquo;re also expanding our research remit. The third edition of our AI Survey, alongside the Bank of England, which is due to be published soon, gives us further insights into how the technology has evolved, including usage of generative AI, and how it is currently being deployed in financial services.</p>
<p>We stand ready to support the next wave of technological innovation in financial services. And as AI continues to evolve, we want to ensure that the technology works for the benefit of everyone, not just a select few. The FCA will remain vigilant, proactive and committed to enhancing AI use without sacrificing the trust and security that underpin financial services.</p>
<p>To this end, we have listened to the challenges firms face around AI and continue to adapt to their needs and work towards removing blockers to innovation. One of these steps was making our Digital Sandbox permanent in August of last year, to facilitate firms testing of innovative proofs of concepts for products and services. Since launch, 53 AI-related applications have been made, accounting for almost half of all the applications made to the service. But that&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<h3>AI Lab</h3>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to innovation, I am thrilled to announce the launch of a new initiative. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab">AI Lab</a>. This is the next step in our mission to help firms overcome challenges they face in building and implementing AI solutions, as well as supporting the Government&rsquo;s work on safe and responsible AI development.</p>
<p>We are also exploring closer collaboration with the DRCF on this initiative, a natural evolution in our work together following our collaboration on the AI &amp; Digital Hub. Our AI Lab will play a critical role by providing AI-related insights, discussions, and case studies, helping us deepen our understanding of potential AI risks and opportunities in a collaborative environment, where regulators and industry can engage candidly and openly.</p>
<p>The Lab will be made up of four components:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI Spotlight</li>
<li>AI Sprint&nbsp;</li>
<li>AI Input Zone&nbsp;</li>
<li>Supercharged Sandbox and testing</li>
</ul>
<h4>AI Spotlight</h4>
<p>The AI Spotlight will provide a space for firms and innovators to share real-world examples of how they are leveraging AI, and to share emerging AI solutions that will lead to industry growth. The AI Spotlight will be hosted on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/our-innovation-services" title="Our innovation services">Innovation Services</a>&nbsp;FCA portal, offering a valuable repository of practical solutions that showcase applications of AI across specific themes. Those accepted will also take part in a Showcase Day at the FCA London office on 28 January 2025. Firms can apply to the AI Spotlight today.</p>
<h4>AI Sprint</h4>
<p>The AI Policy Sprint will bring together the brightest minds in industry, academia, regulation, technology and consumer representatives, to focus on how we enable the safe adoption of AI in financial services. We will host this inaugural AI Sprint in January 2025.</p>
<h4>AI Input Zone</h4>
<p>We look forward to inviting all stakeholders to have their say on the future of AI in UK financial services, including our regulatory approach, through an online feedback platform. We want to hear your views on the most transformative use cases, how our current framework works and how we may need to adapt in the future. The platform will open next month.</p>
<h4>Supercharged Sandbox</h4>
<p>Looking ahead, we&rsquo;ll run AI-focused TechSprints and enhance our Digital Sandbox infrastructure through greater computing power, enriched datasets and increased AI testing capabilities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard directly from firms about the challenges they face, and we&rsquo;ve adapted our approach to meet those needs. The AI Lab is a testament to our commitment to listening and responding to industry, while continuing to push for innovation that creates better outcomes for consumers and markets alike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chance for us to work together to shape the future of AI in financial services, providing us with a practical understanding of AI usage, and helping to inform the FCA&rsquo;s policy approach. Whether you represent a fintech, financial institution, academia, consumer interests or a technology provider,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onlinesurveys.fca.org.uk/jfe/form/SV_bddRDLKJQdA4Awm">sign up</a>&nbsp;today to receive details of these services. Find more information on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab">AI Lab</a>&nbsp;page. These initiatives are built with your needs in mind, and we are eager to continue collaborating to ensure that the next wave of innovation is more impactful than the last.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That next wave of innovation, whether it be fund tokenisation, green finance, AI, quantum, or any other of the exciting innovations on our horizon, will be met with a financial services regulator ready to support the adoption of these innovations to support growth in our economy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve established FinTech and RegTech market analysis functions, alongside an Emerging Tech team looking at Horizon Scanning, ensuring that we have a telescope trained at whatever is coming next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This applies to new technologies and priority areas, such as financial inclusion or market abuse, that affect both consumers and the markets we protect.</p>
<p>To our collaborators - the FinTechs, institutions, suppliers, technology firms, consumer groups, academics, government members, and innovators &ndash; thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p>Our services thrive because of your participation. Thanks to all the firms who applied to the Regulatory Sandbox, Innovation Pathways or the Digital Sandbox. Working with you has enriched our services immensely.</p>
<p>Your collaboration has been invaluable, and together, we&rsquo;ve navigated uncharted waters over the last 10 years to help create a more innovative, inclusive and competitive financial ecosystem in the UK.</p>
<p>We are proud of what we&rsquo;ve achieved together, and this is just the beginning.&nbsp;We remain committed to working alongside you, ready and waiting to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities that the next decade will bring.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to continue this journey as we plot a course for the future of innovation in financial services.</p>

<div> Launch, Bank Transfer, Worldline, Europe, Payment<br />
<br />Worldline launches "Bank Transfer by Worldline" in 10 European countries, expanding to 4 more by 2024, offering a seamless, secure, and innovative account-to-account payment solution.<br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, today announces the launch of its account-to-account payment method named &ldquo;Bank Transfer by Worldline&rdquo;.

<p>This innovative solution particularly caters to businesses that handle high-value transactions, such as those in specialty retail, the public sector and B2B payments. By addressing common challenges like card limits and heightened fraud risk, &ldquo;Bank Transfer by Worldline&rdquo; minimizes the likelihood of declined transactions and reduces costs for merchants. Additionally, it offers cross-border capabilities that are essential for merchants operating in multiple markets.</p>
<p><b>Paul Marriott-Clarke, Head of Merchant Services at Worldline</b>, stated: &ldquo;With &ldquo;Bank Transfer by Worldline&rdquo;, we have developed a payment method grounded in trust and simplicity, leveraging existing European payment networks and offering innovative customer experience.

<div> Consultation, Financial Stability Board, Operational Incidents, Cyber Incidents, Convergence<br />
Summary: FSB introduces FIRE for reporting operational and cyber incidents, aiming for convergence, communication, efficient response, and recovery. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>FSB reveals its common Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE) that financial firms can use for the reporting of operational incidents, including cyber incidents.</span></li>
<li><span>Effective incident reporting strengthens supervision and regulation, fostering transparency and accountability in financial institutions by ensuring regulators are promptly informed of significant operational issues.</span></li>
<li><span>Reducing fragmentation in incident reporting is critical in a globalised financial system where incidents can have cross-border implications. FIRE aims to increase convergence and facilitate communication within and across jurisdictions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today for consultation a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/format-for-incident-reporting-exchange-fire-consultation-report/">Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE)</a>, a common format for financial firms&rsquo; reporting of operational incidents, including cyber incidents. FIRE aims to promote convergence in reporting practices, to address operational challenges arising from reporting to multiple authorities, and to foster better communication within and across jurisdictions. FIRE builds on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/recommendations-to-achieve-greater-convergence-in-cyber-incident-reporting-final-report/">FSB Recommendations to Achieve Greater Convergence in Cyber Incident Reporting</a>, published in 2023.</p>
<p>Incident reporting is a key mechanism for financial authorities to monitor disruptions within regulated entities. Currently, differences in reporting approaches across jurisdictions result in fragmented requirements and coordination challenges, which could exacerbate financial stability risks arising from operational incidents, including cyber incidents. Greater convergence between reporting frameworks will support financial institutions&rsquo; efficient incident response and recovery, as well as more effective supervision and cooperation among authorities.</p>
<p>Developed in consultation with the private sector, FIRE provides a set of common information items for reporting incidents. Its design maximises flexibility and interoperability. Authorities can choose the extent to which they adopt FIRE, leveraging its features and definitions to promote convergence and facilitate translation between existing frameworks. Similarly, financial institutions can use FIRE both in their reporting to financial authorities and in their relationships with service providers. The consultation package consists of (i) a &lsquo;human-readable&rsquo; format, (ii) a structured data model of FIRE using the reporting-language-agnostic Data Point Model method, and (iii) a taxonomy in eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) as a sample machine-readable version of FIRE.</p>
<p>The FSB is inviting comments on the consultation package and the questions set out. Responses should be submitted via this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/survey/465494?newtest=Y&amp;lang=en">secure online form</a>&nbsp;by 19 December 2024.</p>
<p>Responses will be published on the FSB&rsquo;s website unless respondents expressly request otherwise on the online form.</p>
<p>For questions, or if you wish to submit supplementary material, please contact the FSB by email (<a href="mailto:fsb@fsb.org?subject=FIRE%20public%20consultation">fsb@fsb.org</a>).</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB published a report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/10/cyber-incident-reporting-existing-approaches-and-next-steps-for-broader-convergence/">Cyber Incident Reporting: Existing Approaches and Next Steps for Broader Convergence</a>&nbsp;in October 2021. The report set out three ways to achieve greater convergence in cyber incident reporting: developing best practices for incident reporting; identifying common types of information to be shared; and creating common terminologies for cyber incident reporting. The FSB followed up, in April 2023, with a comprehensive approach to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/recommendations-to-achieve-greater-convergence-in-cyber-incident-reporting-final-report/">achieving greater convergence in cyber incident reporting</a>, which included an updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/cyber-lexicon-updated-in-2023/">cyber lexicon</a>&nbsp;and a concept for developing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/format-for-incident-reporting-exchange-fire-a-possible-way-forward/">common format for incident reporting exchange (FIRE)</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div> platform, D7, digital issuances, Clearstream, ECB trials
Summary: Clearstream's D7 platform reaches €10 billion in digital issuances, with ongoing ECB trials. It calls for transitory solution after successful trials. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="row-with-description ">
<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>15,000 digital issuances via D7 on a weekly basis</li>
<li>D7 DLT is key contributor to ongoing ECB trials</li>
<li>Clearstream calls for transitory solution after ECB trials</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearstream, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s post-trade services provider, has reached a significant milestone of a digital issuance volume of &euro;10 billion on its next-generation digital post-trade platform, D7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With D7, Clearstream aims to digitise the entire post-trade value chain, helping the financial industry to move to the digital world. Starting with the issuance process, D7 already processed over 250,000 digital issuances. With up to 15,000 new digital issuances added on a weekly basis, D7 is positioned as the leading digital financial market infrastructure globally.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Key financial institutions have already connected to D7, digitising their issuance portfolios of structured products and debt instruments without major implications to their existing tech stack. Germany&rsquo;s promotional bank, KfW, used D7 for the issuance of its two latest EUR benchmark bonds as central register securities in June (&euro;4 bn, 3ys) &ndash; increased to a volume of &euro;5bn in September &ndash; and October (&euro;3bn, 7ys). &nbsp;</p>
</div>

Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets at Clearstream, commented:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;Reaching &euro;10 billion in issuance volume plus the large number of securities already issued on our D7 platform not only reflect our clients&rsquo; commitment and trust placed but also highlight the transformative potential of scalable digital solutions in enhancing market efficiency and liquidity. We are excited to continue our journey towards a fully digitised post-trade ecosystem, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to deliver real value-add to our clients and the financial markets overall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p class="p--heading-2">Calling for a transitory solution after the DLT ECB trials&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The platform&rsquo;s success is further bolstered by Clearstream&rsquo;s participation as DLT Market Operator in the European Central Bank (ECB) trials and experiments, exploring the potential of new technologies for wholesale digital payments targeting a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Recent successful live DLT transactions on D7 involved market players from across Europe, such as DekaBank, DZ Bank, Eurex Clearing, JP Morgan, NatWest, the German state of Saxony-Anhalt and the German central bank, Deutsche Bundesbank.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&ldquo;The ECB trials have been very successful so far and the experience gathered has been invaluable. Clearstream calls for a frictionless lead-over of the proven trial infrastructure into a transitory solution. This would serve as the nucleus for developing a stable long-term solution to advance a competitive digital financial ecosystem in Europe,&rdquo; adds Jens Hachmeister.</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia And Khazanah Sign MoU To Catalyse MTC Access To The Capital Market - An Initial RM500 Million To Catalyse The Growth Of MTCs Through Khazanah’s Dana Impak</title>

<div> Memorandum of Understanding, Khazanah, MTC, SC, funding
<br />
Summary:<br />
The Securities Commission Malaysia and Khazanah Nasional Berhad signed an MoU to provide funding and support for Malaysian mid-tier companies' growth and expansion. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah) via Dana Impak Fund to increase access to funding and familiarise the capital markets for Malaysian mid-tier companies (MTC) to further catalyse their growth and expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The MoU supports the SC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Catalysing MSME and MTC Access to the Capital Market: 5Year Roadmap (2024-2028)&rsquo; (&ldquo;MSME and MTC Roadmap&rdquo;).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi commended Khazanah&rsquo;s commitment to support the growth and expansion of MTCs. &ldquo;We appreciate Khazanah&rsquo;s support of the MSME and MTC Roadmap and SC&rsquo;s long-term goal to ensure a more inclusive and holistic capital market fundraising ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MTCs are significant domestic employers and economic contributors. However, they have been identified as the &lsquo;missing middle&rsquo;, as they often face difficulties in accessing financing for growth. This MOU will address such challenges to ensure sustainable growth and resilience,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>MTCs make up less than 2% of firms in Malaysia but contribute 36% of Malaysia&rsquo;s gross domestic product (GDP) and 16% of employment. This presents a significant driving force for the Malaysian economy, and potential demand pool for the capital market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Khazanah Managing Director Dato&rsquo; Amirul Feisal Wan Zahir said that the fund is committed to empowering Malaysian companies and MTCs by providing them with the opportunities they need to excel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Khazanah, through Dana Impak which is a key pillar under its Advancing Malaysia strategy, has earmarked an initial RM500 million to provide funding to MTCs. This funding&nbsp;will be directed to high-potential MTCs via the private markets, be it private equity or private credit funds, ensuring greater access to capital. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the key pillars for Khazanah&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Nation that Creates&rdquo; framework is in catalysing future ready industries and talents, anchored on transforming firms of different sizes to derive greater value creation, while increasing national productivity and global competitiveness. The objective is also to establish Malaysian companies that continue to create and innovate, with persistent growth momentum and economic resilience. We look forward to our collaboration with the SC, to support MTCs to be well-positioned to contribute substantially to the nation,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Through mutual co-operation, the MoU will focus on measures to support MTCs&rsquo; next phase of growth and innovation, and joint programmes and initiatives to increase their awareness and access to the capital market. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundraising incubation for 60 - 100 MTCs to enhance capital market-readiness </li>
<li>Specialised MTC capacity-building programmes to raise MTC competitiveness and innovative capacity &nbsp;</li>
<li>Greater MTC-focused investments to spur this growth segment </li>
</ul>
<p>Under this MOU, Khazanah will also implement capacity-building programmes with key partners such as the SC to drive productivity improvements and unlock new opportunities in business, innovation and funding including market-based financing solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim is to build a strong pipeline of capital market-ready MTCs, including upskilling a pool of selected MTCs on fundraising requirements via the Elevate programme by the SC affiliate Capital Markets Malaysia, and enhancing their growth innovation capabilities.</p>
<p>These initiatives are consistent and in line with the ambition of the MSME and MTC Roadmap<sup>1</sup> and the GEAR-uP programme<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<hr />
</p>
<ol>
<li>The key outcome of the Roadmap is to increase fundraising in the MSME and MTC capital market to RM40 billion in 2028.</li>
<li>GEAR-uP is a 5-year RM120 billion programme by government-linked investment companies (GLICs) to invest in &ldquo;high growth, high value&rdquo; industries such as energy transition and advanced manufacturing.</li>

<title>With UPI Reporting To Launch In APAC Region, DSB Reveals Data On Industry Readiness - UPI Reporting In Australia And Singapore Commences 21 October 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today released data indicating industry readiness for the start of UPI (Unique Product Identifier) reporting in Australia and Singapore on 21 October 2024.</span><span><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span>Whilst there is a global aim to monitor systemic risk across the OTC derivatives markets and achieve data harmonisation, each region has approached the implementation of the UPI based on the needs of their market and established their own reporting structure and format.&nbsp;<span>The Australian Securities Investment Commission (ASIC) and The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) now&nbsp;</span><span>follow the US, EU and UK authorities in implementing mandatory UPI reporting this month. Whilst many multi-jurisdictional organisations with US, EU and/or UK reporting requirements have onboarded already with the DSB, locally based APAC organisations have been considering connectivity and functionality requirements for the first time.</span><br /><br /><span>The DSB&rsquo;s user onboarding data shows that over the last few months the number of entities headquartered in the APAC region has increased steadily to 46 organisations with 17 headquartered in Australia and 18 in Singapore across a range of User Types. APAC representation is expected to continue to grow in 2025 as the Japanese mandate draws nearer in April, and with the Hong Kong go-live in September 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To date</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>over 410&nbsp;</span><span>firms have subscribed to the UPI Service on a fee-paying basis, including&nbsp;</span><span>159&nbsp;</span><span>programmatic users. Quarterly updates on UPI user numbers are published on the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.anna-dsb.com%2Fupi-fee-model-variables%2F/1/010201929948175b-d43ba0f4-b605-4e4d-8850-0c82bc7c0acf-000000/mVZ1IE_7fb_F_qTVzJ73ByC3T-c=396" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>DSB&rsquo;s website</span></a><span>.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>In relation to UPI volumes, UPI generation has increased over the last few weeks correlating with the recent UK mandate coming into effect and the upcoming Australia and Singapore mandates. A similar trend was seen in advance of the US and EU mandates coming into effect. There are approximately 1.3 million UPIs with an average of 9,400 new codes generated per week, with one recent week seeing a spike of over 18,500 UPIs created. Identifier metrics are also published on the&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.anna-dsb.com%2Fidentifier-metrics%2F/1/010201929948175b-d43ba0f4-b605-4e4d-8850-0c82bc7c0acf-000000/EsELeOCaYVIP677iITvtbn5aa0I=396" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>DSB website</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span>Implementation of the UPI realises the reform agenda of the G20&nbsp;<span>to bring greater alignment, efficiency, and resilience to the interconnected, global derivatives markets</span><span>&nbsp;</span>following the financial crisis. The ongoing focus on advancing OTC derivatives regulatory reform continues with Japan implementing UPI reporting on 7 April 2025, Canada on 25 July 2025 and Hong Kong on 29 September 2025. Korea and Saudi Arabia are also advancing preparations for the roll out of mandatory UPI reporting.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Fintech, AI-powered platform, Capital Markets infrastructure, automation, market data<br />
Summary:<br />
Fintech AiMi launches AI-powered platform to automate and streamline access to Capital Markets infrastructure, managing updates and providing a chat agent. <br /> <div>
<p>AiMi, a Fintech specialising in mission-critical trading and market data infrastructure management solutions, has launched its AI-powered platform to automate and streamline access to Capital Markets infrastructure. The platform enables firms to efficiently manage and action changes to trading venue&rsquo;s platforms, services, and APIs.</p>
<p>The infrastructure powering capital markets is critical, complex and constantly evolving. Market structure, regulatory reforms, new technology innovations, and competition for liquidity drive a constant stream of updates. Monitoring, reviewing and triaging thousands of monthly announcements and notifications received each month from global exchanges, trading venues and vendors requires significant resources to stay on top of a constant stream of changes to mission-critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>AiMi, currently in public beta, automates and streamlines the process by codifying these notices and documents into actionable data sets to enable automation workflows to assess the impact and take appropriate actions. AiMi&rsquo;s digitised service catalogue of change notifications, technical specifications, and data policies automates the notification process to identify and extract key information. These are then aggregated into trackable changes for triage and action. This allows firms to refocus their resources on more impactful initiatives, whilst efficiently managing critical exchange connectivity and API changes.</p>
<p>This release also includes a natural language copilot chat agent, offering quick and direct access to questions on trading and market data venues, platforms and policies. Powered by the same curated and codified service catalogue, the agent provides constant and comprehensive answers to in-depth technical and functional queries, enhancing efficiency for resource-constrained operations and technology teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to introduce AiMi&rsquo;s innovative AI-powered solution designed to redefine how firms manage market infrastructure changes. With exchange announcements and technical specifications being highly unstructured, companies often invest significant resources in manually managing these changes&rdquo;,&nbsp;<span>Ollie Cadman, CEO and Founder of AiMi</span>, explains "AiMi&rsquo;s current release focuses on automating this process by codifying the unstructured data, streamlining workflows, reducing costs and redirecting resources to higher-value growth activities."</p>
<p>To learn more about AiMi&rsquo;s platform and how it can transform your access to capital markets infrastructure, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://stories.prowly.com/aimi.technology" target="_blank">https://aimi.technology</a>.</p>

The integration removes the need to hold collateral with the trading venue, providing a seamless and secure solution. Investors will also be able to increase their crypto collateral positions within seconds, avoiding the lengthy delays often associated with traditional on-chain transactions. The integrated solution with SDX&rsquo;s custody services and RULEMATCH&rsquo;s trading and settlement platform will be available from Q4 2024.</p>
<p>Commenting on the significance of the partnership, David Newns, Head of SIX Digital Exchange, said: "Until now, the digital asset space has been held back by concerns around speed, compliance and fragmentation. Our partnership with RULEMATCH tackles these issues head-on by providing transparency, capital efficiency and, crucially, a clear separation of trading and custody roles. This means institutional investors retain full control over their collateral via SDX&rsquo;s custody and can segregate assets by crypto address, ensuring clarity on asset location at all times. As part of SIX, a trusted provider of global financial infrastructure, SDX continues to uphold the highest standards of security and compliance for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Riegelnig, CEO of RULEMATCH, added: &ldquo;We have always believed that separating the roles of trading and custody is key to serving financial institutions in the digital assets industry. As a pure market operator, RULEMATCH is thrilled to partner with SDX and integrate its custody services with our trading and settlement platform. And we know from our participants that many of them would love to use a secure, independent custodian like SDX to manage the full lifecycle of their crypto asset holdings, while also leveraging the competitive advantages of trading and settling on RULEMATCH. Thanks to our partnership, they can do exactly that.&rdquo;</p>

Summary:<br />
- SZSE launched a Sustainable Financial Service Platform
- It provides resources for sustainable development.
- SZSE supports green industry development.
- It offers sustainable financial products.
- SZSE participates in global sustainable finance governance. <div>
<p align="justify">To implement the guiding principles of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee and the Central Financial Work Conference, and in line with the national green development policies, Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) has launched a Sustainable Financial Service Platform on&nbsp;the&nbsp;official website. This move aims to further enhance the efficiency of sustainable financial services.</p>
<p align="justify">Market participants can access the platform via the "Market Services" section on&nbsp;the&nbsp;SZSE website. The platform offers a one-stop portal for sustainable development resources of the&nbsp;Shenzhen&nbsp;market. The platform is divided into five sections: Listed Company Practices, Sustainable Financial Products, Regulations and Guidelines, International Exchanges, and Training Materials.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Listed Company Practices&nbsp;section offers access to&nbsp;the&nbsp;sustainability reports, case studies, and CNI ESG evaluations of SZSE-listed companies.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Sustainable Financial Products&nbsp;section supports queries on fixed income, infrastructure REITs, funds, indices, and other sustainable financial products in the SZSE market, as well as related announcements. The&nbsp;Regulations and Guidelines&nbsp;section provides access to documents related to sustainable finance issued by the CSRC, SZSE, CGBSC, etc. The&nbsp;International Exchanges&nbsp;section showcases SZSE's efforts to deepen international cooperation in sustainable finance. The&nbsp;Training Materials&nbsp;section provides sustainable finance-related training courses, research reports, and references on international sustainable finance standards.</p>
<p align="justify">SZSE has consistently pursued a sustainable development strategy, focusing on building a sustainable financial market ecosystem. We strive to establish SZSE as a leading example of a sustainable exchange and contribute to the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.&nbsp;Firstly, we have been supporting the clustered development of green industries.&nbsp;With the registration-based IPO reform as the driving force, SZSE has promoted institutional innovation, enabling the rapid development of green and low-carbon industries through the capital market platform.&nbsp;As of now, there are nearly 400 listed companies in the green and low-carbon fields in the&nbsp;Shenzhen&nbsp;market, with a total market value of over 6 trillion yuan, accounting for 20% of the total market value of SZSE-listed companies.&nbsp;Secondly, we guide listed companies and bond issuers to embrace sustainable development.&nbsp;SZSE has issued guidelines for sustainability reports, special corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities, clarifying disclosure requirements for sustainability reports of listed companies, as well as disclosure requirements for the environmental and social benefits of green and low-carbon transition, rural revitalization fixed-income products, etc. This year, a total of 935 SZSE-listed companies have issued 2023 social responsibility or ESG reports, with a disclosure rate of approximately 35%.&nbsp;Thirdly, we work to expand the supply of sustainable financial products.&nbsp;By the end of September 2024, a total of 219.127 billion yuan of green and low-carbon transition, and rural revitalization fixed-income products had been issued, along with 21.608 billion yuan of sustainable development-themed ETFs.&nbsp;Moreover,&nbsp;SZSE listed the first clean energy infrastructure REIT in China and launched 71 sustainable development-themed indices covering ESG and environmental, social, and governance dimensions.&nbsp;Fourthly, we actively participate in global governance on sustainable development.&nbsp;SZSE has supported representative green and low-carbon enterprises in raising funds abroad through the issuance of GDRs and has hosted the Global Investors Conference for four consecutive years, with a focus on sustainable investment.&nbsp;In particular, we have organized several overseas roadshows for SZSE-listed green and low-carbon companies, deepening domestic and international exchanges and cooperation in sustainable finance.</p>
<p align="justify">Guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and fully implementing the guiding principles of the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, SZSE will continue to follow a general work pace of pursuing progress in advancing green finance. We aim to further improve the sustainability information disclosure system, expand the range of sustainable financial products, and integrate green practices into our own operations. Through these efforts, SZSE seeks to promote the construction of a sustainable financial system to attract more patient capital to support sustainable development.</p>

<br />
Robinhood to offer Cboe's index options on its platform, catering to growing retail investor demand, with market data and education.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Robinhood partners with Cboe to offer index options, meeting retail investor demand with market data and education. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>For the first time, Robinhood customers will have access to index options, expanding their trading capabilities on its platform</li>
<li>Cboe's index options &ndash; S&amp;P 500 Index, Cboe Volatility Index, Russell 2000 Index, and Mini S&amp;P 500 Index options &ndash; soon available to Robinhood customers on its platform</li>
<li>Launch taps into rising investor demand for options trading, market data and education</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, and Robinhood Markets Inc. today announced at the HOOD Summit in Miami, Florida, Robinhood's upcoming launch of Cboe's index options on its platform.&nbsp; For the first time, Robinhood customers will soon be able to trade index options &ndash; including Cboe's flagship S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) options, Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) options, Russell 2000 Index (RUT) options and Mini SPX (XSP) options &ndash; expanding their trading capabilities on its platform.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Cboe's proprietary suite of index options will provide Robinhood's customers potential new ways to gain broad U.S. market exposure, hedge against U.S. large-cap and U.S. small-cap equity market volatility, generate income and capitalize on market movements<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;on Robinhood's platform. Index options offer the benefits of cash-settlement (accounts are debited or credited in cash; there is no physical transfer of shares) and European-style exercise (options expire on their expiration date; there is no risk of early assignment).</p>
<p>"The rise of the retail investor is one of the greatest forces reshaping financial markets today," said Dave Howson, Global President at Cboe Global Markets. "Retail traders have expanded their financial knowledge and trading experience in recent years to become much more sophisticated, and now, they are seeking new opportunities to further elevate their trading strategies. Cboe's proprietary index options are among some of the world's most popular, liquid and actively traded options products, which we believe will be a welcome addition to the retail trader's toolkit. Cboe's index options have long been used by institutional investors to manage risk and build wealth. Now, with Robinhood offering index options to its growing user base, we are excited even more investors may access the utility of our products."</p>
<p>Robinhood makes&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4279249-1&amp;h=2888951066&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Fus%2Findices%2Faccessing-index-data%2F&amp;a=Cboe+Global+Indices+Feed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe Global Indices Feed</a>, which provides real-time index values for products like SPX, VIX and RUT options, available to its customers. The feed may offer additional data to support customers when making their own trading decisions.</p>
<p>"Robinhood continues to deliver innovative and intuitive trading solutions that empower retail investors, and our collaboration with Cboe aligns perfectly with that mission," said Steve Quirk, Chief Brokerage Officer at Robinhood. "As our customers have grown, they have asked us for access to more advanced assets including index options, which allow them to diversify their portfolio and better manage risk. Adding index options to Robinhood is a natural extension of our product offering and has been one of the most requested asset classes by our customers. This will be another powerful tool to help them navigate their financial future."</p>
<p>Demand for options trading has risen among both retail and institutional investors who may be seeking tools to manage risk and capture market opportunities. In 2023, total U.S. options volumes exceeded 11 billion contracts, marking the fourth consecutive year of record volumes and a 126% increase since 2019<sup>2</sup>. Average daily volumes this year through third-quarter 2024<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;was 47 million contracts, an 8% increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Cboe's proprietary product suite has similarly seen increasing investor participation, with average daily volumes reaching a record high of 4.2 million contracts during third-quarter 2024, up 13% from third-quarter 2023. In response to growing investor demand, Cboe's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4279249-1&amp;h=3816779771&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Foptionsinstitute%2F&amp;a=Options+Institute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Options Institute</a>, a leader in options education for more than 35 years, has expanded its offerings to include free online courses, webinars, interactive tutorials and insights from top market experts and academics, all tailored to help retail traders &ndash; whether beginners or seasoned investors &ndash; enhance their understanding of index options and build the knowledge they need to trade with confidence.</p>
<p>"As we move through 2024, one theme is clear: the need for robust risk management tools has never been greater and we see both institutional and retail participants, domestic and international, increasingly turning to options," said Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe Global Markets. "We see that investors are trading options with both longer and shorter durations and utilizing various strategies &ndash; whether hedging event risk, systematically selling call and put spreads to generate income, or trading options within a shorter time horizon to capture intraday moves. The U.S. options market has never been more vibrant and robust, and, as the options industry leader, Cboe remains committed to providing all investors access to this deep and growing liquidity pool."</p>

<title>SEC Charges Virginia-Based RTX Corp. With Violating Foreign Corrupt Practices Act In Connection With Efforts To Obtain Contracts With The Qatari Military</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> aerospace, defense, FCPA, Raytheon, SEC
Summary:
RTX, formerly Raytheon, violated FCPA by paying bribes to Qatari officials to secure military contracts, leading to a $124 million settlement. An independent compliance monitor is required.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that RTX Corporation, a Virginia-based aerospace and defense company, agreed to pay more than $124 million to resolve charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with payments made to assist in obtaining contracts with the Qatari military. RTX, which was named Raytheon Technologies Corp. until 2023, was formed after the 2020 merger of Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corp. (collectively, Raytheon).</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, Raytheon used sham subcontracts with a supplier to pay bribes of nearly $2 million to Qatari military and other officials from 2011 to 2017 to obtain Qatari military defense contracts. Additionally, the order finds that from the early 2000s into 2020, Raytheon paid more than $30 million to a Qatari agent who was a relative of the Qatari Emir and who, despite being retained as Raytheon&rsquo;s representative in Qatar, had no prior background in military defense contracting. Raytheon obtained additional defense contracts through the agent under circumstances with significant corruption risks. The order finds that Raytheon continued working with the agent even after numerous Raytheon employees raised concerns about risks of corruption and despite a lack of adequate documentation of the agent&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>"The penalty in this case reflects the significant misconduct by Raytheon and the need for global companies to implement meaningful internal accounting controls that ensure that payments to intermediaries are not used to circumvent the restrictions of the FCPA,&rdquo; said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Raytheon violated the antibribery, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions of the FCPA. Raytheon consented to the entry of the SEC&rsquo;s order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of approximately $49 million and a civil penalty of $75 million, $22.5 million of which will be offset by a criminal fine in a parallel criminal action. As part of the resolution, Raytheon must retain an independent compliance monitor for three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Irene Gutierrez, Ilana Z. Sultan, Eric Heining, Sonali Singh, and Tracy L. Price of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.&nbsp;</p>

Summary:<br />
DFS Superintendent issued guidance on cybersecurity risks from AI, focusing on existing obligations, risk-based approach, and multiple layers of security controls. <div>
<p>New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris today issued new guidance to assist regulated entities in addressing and combating cybersecurity risks arising from artificial intelligence. The guidance builds on the Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to protect New Yorkers and DFS-licensed entities from cybersecurity risks through its nation-leading cybersecurity regulation (23 NYCRR Part 500) and follows recently adopted DFS guidance to combat discrimination by insurers using artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;AI has improved the ability for businesses to enhance threat detection and incident response strategies, while concurrently creating new opportunities for cybercriminals to commit crimes at greater scale and speed,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said Superintendent Harris</span>. &ldquo;New York will continue to ensure that as AI -enabled tools become more prolific, security standards remain rigorous to safeguard critical data, while allowing the flexibility needed to address diverse risk profiles in an ever-changing digital landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DFS-regulated institutions must assess and take appropriate steps to address their cybersecurity risks, including evolving risks arising from AI. Consistent with the Department&rsquo;s cybersecurity regulation, this guidance takes a risk-based approach to assist the financial services sector to better understand, assess, and mitigate their AI-specific cybersecurity risks, including social engineering, enhanced cyber-attacks, theft of nonpublic information, and increased vulnerabilities due to supply chain dependencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critically, the cybersecurity measures outlined in the guidance and required by the cybersecurity regulation provide multiple layers of security controls with overlapping protections. This ensures that if one control fails, other controls are in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity attack.</p>
<p>This guidance does not impose new requirements, it helps DFS-regulated institutions meet their existing obligations in the Department&rsquo;s cybersecurity regulation in light of evolving risks from AI.</p>
<p>A copy of the guidance can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters" target="_blank">Department&rsquo;s website</a>.&nbsp;Additional cybersecurity resources can be found on the Department&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/cyber" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Resource Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Keywords: ESMA, MiCA, Regulatory Technical Standards, crypto-assets, European Commission

Summary: ESMA responds to Commission's MiCA RTS proposal, emphasizes policy objectives. Recommends amendments for thorough assessment of crypto-asset service providers. Next steps with EC, Parliament, and Council.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has responded to the European Commission proposal to amend the Markets in crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA) Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS). ESMA acknowledges the legal limitations raised by the Commission but emphasises the importance of the policy objectives behind the initial proposal.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA35-1872330276-195_-_MiCA_Opinion_on_rejection_of_RTS_CASPs_authorisations_and_notifications.pdf">Opinion</a>, ESMA takes note of the amendments proposed to the two RTS specifying:</p>
<ul>
<li>the information to be included in a notification by certain financial entities of their intention to provide crypto-asset services and&nbsp;</li>
<li>the information to be included in an application for authorisation as crypto-asset service provider.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA also reiterates that the final objective of these RTS is to ensure a thorough entry point assessment for applicant crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and financial entities intending to provide crypto-asset services in the EU. This will increase the resilience of the crypto assets market and enhance investor protection in the crypto-assets space.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA therefore&nbsp;recommends the Commission consider amendments to the MICA regulation (Level 1), namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>requiring applicant crypto-asset service providers and notifying entities to provide the results of an external cybersecurity audit; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>including, in the assessment of the good repute of the members of the management body of applicant crypto-asset service providers, checks regarding the absence of penalties also in areas other than commercial law, insolvency law, financial services law, anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing, fraud or professional liability.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Background</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">On 25 March 2024, ESMA published its first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-03/ESMA18-72330276-1634_Final_Report_on_certain_technical_standards_under_MiCA_First_Package.pdf">final report</a>&nbsp;on the draft RTS specifying certain requirements of MiCA and submitted it to the EC for adoption. In September 2024, the Commission informed ESMA that it intended to adopt two of the proposed RTS with amendments and invited ESMA to submit new draft RTS reflecting the amendments provided.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">This opinion has been communicated by ESMA to the Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The EC may adopt the two RTS with the amendments it considers relevant or reject it. The European Parliament and the Council may object to an RTS adopted by the EC within a period of three months.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) and the Indian Gas Exchange (IGX), in cooperation with the Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), have agreed to support the development of the hydrogen trading market in India. This cooperation project takes place under the International Hydrogen Ramp-Up (H2Uppp) program, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK), which aims to promote projects and market development for green hydrogen in selected emerging countries.</p>
<p>The collaboration will initially focus on gathering market insights, as well as on engaging and developing a local community in order to establish and develop this market in the future. The project parties will bring together stakeholders from production, trading, transport and consumption, including policy makers and regulators, and jointly build up an action plan with the mid-term goal to offer an index and trading services for hydrogen in India.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>With hydrogen expected to play a crucial role in the energy transition, it is important to have a global focus when developing this sector. We are delighted to contribute our market building expertise to this co-operation, and support the local hydrogen community on this journey.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rajesh Mediratta, Managing Director and CEO of IGX, adds: &ldquo;<em>With our experience in creating energy markets in India, we&rsquo;re excited to use that knowledge to build the hydrogen market. This partnership is a significant milestone for the Indian green energy sector. We look forward to jointly develop this market in line with global best practices.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tobias Winter, Director Indo-German Energy Forum Support Office at GIZ, comments: &ldquo;<em>We are delighted to bring EEX and IGX together to initiate trading of hydrogen in India. The establishment of an Indian hydrogen price index particularly for green hydrogen would send price signals not only to the Indian market but also to interested offtakers globally. Another step of India to become a global green hydrogen hub.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<title>DTCC’s Data Services Now Offers Corporate Fixed Income Premium Intraday Reference Data, To Increase Operational Efficiency - By Accessing Underlying Security Data Already Held At NSCC And DTC On A More Frequent Basis, Firms Can Better Prepare To Meet T+1 And Accelerated Settlement Timelines</title>

<div> enhanced fixed income security, reference data, timelier basis, operational processes, market efficiency
Summary:<br />DTCC enhances fixed income security data with 20 new elements, refreshed every 30 minutes, enabling faster processing and trading decisions. Improved market efficiency. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced an enhanced fixed income security master file data offering, providing more data at a higher frequency.</p>
<p>The enhanced security master file, known as Corporate Fixed Income Premium Intraday Reference Data, contains more than 20 new data elements, including security description, bond duration, interest rate, coupon frequency and details referencing whether the security is convertible, puttable or callable. DTCC serves a unique position in the market by being the lynchpin for reference data and corporate actions between issuers, custodians, and beneficial owners. The data is refreshed every 30 minutes, 23 times per day.</p>
<p>With this enhancement, firms have access to an expanded data set on a timelier basis, enabling organizations to reduce front and back-office friction by leveraging security reference data required to process trades on newly issued bonds faster. Quicker data access also enables portfolio managers to ascertain portfolio composition, comply with portfolio holding guidelines (such as asset allocation), and inform trading opportunities. In addition, firms can consider new issuances and security characteristics while making trading decisions. By expediting operational reference data creation and validation, firms can improve their operational processes and lower cost and risk.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Confirmation Of Weekly Frequency For Indexed Long-Term Repo Operations - Market Notice 16 October 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Repo-led, demand-driven operational framework, Indexed Long-Term Repo, reserves, Bank of England<br />
Summary:<br />
The Bank of England confirms the permanent offering of weekly Indexed Long-Term Repo operations for reserves, with a revised maturity date structure. The Terms and Conditions remain applicable. <div>
<p><span>In line with the Bank&rsquo;s transition to a repo-led, demand driven operational framework for providing reserves, which Indexed Long-Term Repo operations are central to, this Market Notice confirms that these operations will continue to be offered weekly on a permanent basis. There will be an accompanying change to the maturity date structure of Indexed Long-Term Repo operations to ensure alignment with their weekly frequency.</span></p>
<h2>Market Notice</h2>
<p>The Bank of England (the Bank) has been offering Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR) operations weekly, on a temporary basis, since March 2019. Prior to this, ILTR operations were offered once a month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank is today confirming that the ILTR, which offers reserves for a 6-month period against the full range of SMF-eligible collateral, will continue as a weekly operation on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The permanent instatement of the ILTR as a weekly facility reflects the Bank&rsquo;s ongoing transition to a repo-led, demand-driven operational framework. Within this framework, the ILTR will play a key role in supplying the stock of reserves demanded by the system for monetary and financial stability reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From w/c 4 November 2024, the maturity structure of ILTR operations will be amended to reflect the weekly frequency of the operation. This means that the term of all ILTR drawings will now mature after exactly 6 months. Previously, all ILTR operations in a given month had the same single maturity date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/bank-of-england-market-operations-guide/our-tools">Bank&rsquo;s Market Operations Guide</a>&nbsp;has been updated to reflect this announcement. Participants should review the relevant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/collateral-and-settlement">settlement process information for ILTR operations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The updated schedule of operations is set out in Table 1 below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further changes to ILTR calibration are being considered by the Bank as part of the transition to a repo-led demand-driven framework for supplying reserves. The Bank plans to seek views on this via a Discussion Paper which is due to be published later this year. Any further changes to the ILTR will be announced in due course.</p>

Summary:
mRNA-based pharmaceuticals experience 800% increase in licensing agreements; mRNA technology proves successful in COVID-19 vaccines; GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb invest in mRNA therapeutics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span>Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based innovator pharmaceuticals saw a staggering 800% increase in licensing agreement deal values from 2019 to 2024YTD, driven by the remarkable success of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. With growing confidence in this transformative technology, key companies are investing heavily in its potential to address unmet medical needs, indicating that mRNA will remain a critical focus for pharmaceutical innovation and development, says&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3D1S2A_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CnNaglJHIY9BtfQD0SgGHFoAHkU4lfJfoyChVKbrC4JKGHwXvXfZCj-2BfmoMVkyVU6ZYXchSk10NUEojNw6UfWE2voX0s-2BsOqaiRpAUH1AR5Z-2BWZdpag-2BezazBFn3DXDwI6buqZZLCyBZ-2FW1PCZP6KzmZNxC734pmZZKEEqdH0vOlYa5Pzcx1Tbxdev2476PtP0vyAY7DKSREJhge3vrOQwqHZvfzkNtR8-2B77otZGu4-2Bw-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Senior Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the key advantages of mRNA technology in vaccine development, including rapid production, precise immune targeting, and streamlined manufacturing- factors that drove the success of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since the FDA approved Pfizer&rsquo;s Comirnaty in August 2021, the first mRNA vaccine to achieve global market entry, rising licensing agreement values have reflected growing confidence in mRNA technology's broader potential beyond vaccines, marking a pivotal shift in its applications across the pharmaceutical landscape.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Drugs Database, the global sales of innovator mRNA-based drugs are expected to grow from $22 billion in 2023 to $26.2 billion in 2030.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_mRNA_16Oct24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_mRNA_16Oct24.jpg" title="GlobalData_mRNA_16Oct24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan adds: &ldquo;Licensing agreement deal values for mRNA-based pharmaceuticals have doubled since 2023, reaching $3.8 billion, as major players like GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb invest in mRNA therapeutics to address unmet medical needs.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>GSK and CureVac restructured their 2020 collaboration into a new licensing agreement worth up to $1.57 billion in July 2024. This deal focuses on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of mRNA vaccine candidates for influenza and COVID-19, spanning from preclinical to Phase II trials.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bristol Myers Squibb formed a multi-year, $1.87 billion strategic collaboration with Repertoire Immune Medicines in April 2024 to develop mRNA-based tolerizing vaccines for up to three autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, along with other vaccine candidates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently allocated $176 million to Moderna for the development of mRNA-based vaccines targeting multiple strains of pandemic influenza. This investment highlights HHS&rsquo;s focus on pandemic preparedness, reinforcing the versatility and potential of mRNA platforms.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;The increase in licensing agreement values for mRNA pharmaceuticals indicates that this will continue to be a key area for innovation and investment. With advancements in mRNA technology and delivery systems, drugmakers have significant opportunities to expand their portfolios, paving the way for breakthroughs in treating various diseases.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Includes all announced and completed deals for companies headquartered globally from 2020&ndash;2024YTD as a percentage growth from the baseline year 2019. Includes deals where at least one drug involved is an innovator mRNA-based drug where Marketed, Pre-Registration, Phase III, Phase II, Phase I, Preclinical, and Discovery stages are considered. Includes deal values disclosed in the public domain. YTD= Year to date.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"DLT is often associated with blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but it also presents a valuable opportunity for us as an infrastructure service provider to enhance efficiency and transparency in securities settlement. We are proud to work on pioneering technological advancements within the capital market," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The technology enables the management of a securities account and subsequently the transfer of shares or bonds to this account as part of an initial subscription, a capital increase or a transfer from another account on the basis of an agreement with the counterparty. These transactions can be carried out with or without cash settlement. Settlement via DLT has the potential to simplify the process of booking securities reducing the administrative burden for both issuers and security holders. At the same time, the transparency and security of the current central CSD register will be maintained. This will also be possible for private investors by using the electronic identification solution "BankID" to open an account with the CSD and access it via a web or mobile application. The apps are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>"During the implementation of the project, we benefited from two key advantages &ndash; integrated post-trading in the form of CSD Prague, which gives us a perfect overview of all the processes associated with the registration and settlement, and our expert IT team with 20 years of experience in securities business. Thanks to this we were able to develop the system in a very short time", says Petr Koblic, Member of the Board of the Vienna Stock Exchange and CEO of the Prague Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Financial service providers can also become a node in the DLT system and thus open DLT accounts for their customers and record transfers in their systems within their customer applications. Overall, this should create added value for companies with employee participation programmes, FinTechs and crowdfunding platforms that connect to DLT and offer their customers an additional service in the securities sector. For SMEs, the subscription of bonds or shares without additional intermediaries offers an alternative financing option.</p>
<h2>About distributed ledger technology &amp; the EU DLT pilot regime</h2>
<p>A distributed ledger can be described as an information store that contains records of transactions. It is transferred to a number of nodes and synchronised everywhere using a so-called consensus mechanism. To add a block to the ledger, each node in the network must verify and validate it. This means that the system does not need intermediaries to verify transactions. The DLT pilot regime has been in place in the EU since 23 March 2023 and is intended as a temporary "regulatory sandbox" to &ndash; among other things &ndash; facilitate the establishment of new types of market infrastructures, including DLT settlement systems.</p>

<div> package, insurance market, premium finance, competition, motor insurance taskforce
<br />
The FCA is investigating the rising prices in the insurance market, particularly in premium finance, and is part of the Government motor insurance taskforce.
<br /><br />Summary:
FCA investigating rising insurance prices, specifically in premium finance, alongside Government taskforce. Analyzing impact on different customer groups. Interim report expected in H1 2025. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has announced a package of work in the insurance market amid concerns about rising prices, alongside the launch of the Government motor insurance taskforce.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-2-1-premium-finance" title="MS24/2.1 Premium Finance Market Study">launched a review</a>, known as a competition market study, to see whether people who borrow to pay for motor and home insurance are receiving fair, competitive deals.</p>
<p>Premium finance allows people to pay for insurance in instalments. With the average yearly rate on the amount of money borrowed ranging between 20 to 30%, the FCA is concerned that premium finance may not be providing fair value. Over 20 million people are estimated to pay for their insurance this way and FCA research shows that 79% of adults in financial difficulty have used the product.</p>
<p>As part of its market study, the FCA will review whether the products represent fair value, how well customers are made aware of their financing options, the role of commission, and other potential barriers to effective competition in the motor and home premium finance market.</p>
<p><span>Graeme Reynolds, director of competition at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p>'People rely on premium finance to spread their insurance costs by paying in smaller monthly payments. We want to ensure that competition works well and make it easier for consumers to find the best deals.'</p>
<h2>FCA responds to Government motor insurance taskforce</h2>
<p>The Government has announced a taskforce, which includes the FCA, with the aim of identifying any actions that may stabilise or reduce motor insurance premiums, while maintaining appropriate levels of cover.</p>
<p>The FCA will analyse the causes of increased costs in motor insurance and will look closely at claims costs, reviewing claims handling arrangements and factors impacting different types of claim. The regulator will also analyse the impact of rising insurance prices on different customer groups, such as younger and older drivers and those from ethnic minority backgrounds or on lower incomes.</p>
<h2>Background&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read the<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-2-1-premium-finance" title="MS24/2.1 Premium Finance Market Study">&nbsp;market study terms of reference</a>.</li>
<li>The FCA expects to publish an interim report following the market study and proposed next steps during H1 2025.</li>
<li>The FCA has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-expectations-cost-of-living-and-insurance-2022.pdf" title="dear-ceo-letter-expectations-cost-of-living-and-insurance-2022.pdf">written to the insurance industry (PDF)</a>&nbsp;regarding premium finance products with high APRs but low credit risk. &nbsp;</li>
<li>In April 2024, the FCA finalised the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-2-strengthening-protections-borrowers-financial-difficulty" title="PS24/2: Strengthening protections for borrowers in financial difficulty: Consumer credit and mortgages">new guidance for firms on supporting borrowers in financial difficulty</a>, including premium finance customers. &nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ziraat Bank, T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s leading financial institution, has commenced operations at its new office in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region. This move reflects the bank&rsquo;s continued commitment to provide financial services to its customers in the UAE and beyond.<br /><br />The bank&rsquo;s office in DIFC will focus on enhancing relationships with regional financial institutions and facilitating international operations of its clients, including Turkish businesses. Moreover, it will play a pivotal role in supporting entrepreneurs from the UAE in establishing and expanding their businesses through Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s extensive network in T&uuml;rkiye and other countries.</p>
<p>Commenting on this significant milestone,&nbsp;<span>Dr. Ertan ALTIKULA&Ccedil;, Head of International Banking Group of Ziraat Bank T&uuml;rkiye</span>, said: &ldquo;Ziraat Bank holds the distinction of having the most extensive international service network among Turkish banks, with a presence in 19 countries and 123 service points globally. The opening of our representative office in Dubai underscores our commitment to expanding our global footprint with promising business environment and strategic advantages offered by the DIFC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recognised as the deepest financial centre between London and Singapore, DIFC has earned the trust of 250 banks, including 27 of the top 29 globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) with its 20-year-strong reputation for transparency, effective regulation, and knowledge-building.</p>
<p><span>Salmaan Jaffery, Chief Business Development Officer of the DIFC Authority</span>, said, &ldquo;We are pleased that Turkish state-owned lender Ziraat Bank has chosen DIFC as its home in the UAE to support its global expansion plans. The Centre continues to attract some of the strongest financial institutions in the world, which is a testament to its world-class business ecosystem, legal and regulatory framework and infrastructure. This announcement is a further testament to DIFC being the leading hub for regional champions from the Middle East, Africa and T&uuml;rkiye, making it the region&rsquo;s premier global financial hub.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, the UAE signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with T&uuml;rkiye, which is expected to boost bilateral non-oil trade to more than $40 billion in the next five years, from about USD 19bn as of 2023. Furthermore, strong banking ties exist between the two nations, have been further solidified through various strategic investments and collaborations. These efforts underscore the commitment of both countries to fostering a robust financial partnership, which is poised to drive economic growth and innovation in the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank has a strong presence in the Gulf region, with branches in Bahrain, Jeddah, Baghdad, and Erbil, in addition to its representative office in Cairo. The inauguration of the office in DIFC is a testament to the bank&rsquo;s strategic vision to provide extensive, reliable service across the region.</p>

<title>The Expectation Gap: Remarks To The Insurance Council Of Australia 2024 Annual Conference - Speech By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Insurance Council Of Australia 2024 Annual Conference, 16 October 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improving consumer outcomes is a key strategic priority for ASIC. We are focused on improving insurers&rsquo; claims handling, dispute resolution, and treatment of vulnerable customers.</li>
<li>Insurance can be complex, but customers&rsquo; expectations are often simple. Listening and responding to those expectations is critical to rebuilding trust and confidence in the industry.</li>
<li>We remain concerned about the number of unresolved claims from the 2022 floods. It is time to give these individuals<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW251535510 BCX8">&nbsp;</span><span class="TextRun SCXW251535510 BCX8" lang="EN-AU">and families</span>&nbsp;closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is great to be here and great to continue the tradition of ASIC and APRA appearing at this event, as we do together in many of our engagements with the ICA.</p>
<p>I would like to start by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Jagara (Yuggera) and Turrbal people, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I mention as Suzanne [Smith from APRA] did, that we do a lot of our work on insurance together. That&rsquo;s in a context where we have quite complementary but different roles.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s role is obviously as the conduct and consumer protection regulator, and so my comments today are very much about opportunities for improving consumer outcomes in the general insurance sector.</p>
<p>Improving consumer outcomes is a core strategic priority for ASIC, as announced in our most recently published&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/corporate-publications/asic-corporate-plan/" title="ASIC Corporate Plan">Corporate Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the focus areas under that strategic priority are directly relevant to general insurers. They include claims handling, dispute resolution, and treatment of vulnerable customers.</p>
<p>In focusing on these areas, we seek to ensure that insurers deliver what their customers expect from them.</p>
<p>In saying that, we would acknowledge that the details of many insurance policies are understandably complex. But at the same time, the expectations of people who pay for them are often quite simple.</p>
<p>When the worst happens, they expect their claim to be dealt with quickly and fairly.</p>
<p>If they disagree with how a claim has been handled, they expect you to resolve their complaint in a fair and timely way.</p>
<p>And if they are experiencing vulnerability or hardship, they expect to be treated with sensitivity, empathy and flexibility.</p>
<p>Every insurer has the potential to exceed those expectations.</p>
<p>Equally, every insurer can fall short in some cases.</p>
<p>Where we currently see an opportunity for improvement is consistency in the way in which insurers respond to those expectations.</p>
<h3>Expectation 1: Claims handling</h3>
<p>As I said, one area where we see there being opportunity for continued improvement is in relation to claims handling. That should not come as a surprise, because&nbsp;<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW122954229 BCX8">claims handling has&nbsp;</span>been a core priority for ASIC for some time.</p>
<p>In identifying that, I would note that one in 10 complaints made to AFCA last year related to claims handling delays<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-expectation-gap-remarks-to-the-insurance-council-of-australia-2024-annual-conference/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>That was particularly disappointing, given that our review of home insurance claims handling (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-768-navigating-the-storm-asic-s-review-of-home-insurance-claims/" title="REP 768 Navigating the storm: ASIC's review of home insurance claims">REP 768</a>), released in August 2023, had identified three areas for improvement, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>better communications</li>
<li>better project management and oversight of third parties, and</li>
<li>better identification and treatment of vulnerable customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We note since our review, insurers have boosted their claims handling resourcing with temporary staff.</p>
<p>But we need to see a sustained effort to improve resourcing for the handling of claims, regardless of whether they come as part of business as usual or in response to a major natural disaster.</p>
<h3>Expectation 2: Dispute resolution</h3>
<p>The second area I mentioned was in relation to dispute resolution.</p>
<p>When things go wrong, we see complaints as an opportunity to reset the course and get back on track.</p>
<p>In Report 768, we expressed concerns about levels of resourcing for dispute resolution across general insurers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been gathering data on resourcing in the period since, which shows that increases in internal dispute resolution resourcing have not matched the rate of increases in complaints &ndash; and quite frankly, too many complaints are still making their way through to AFCA.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that those cases can be complex, but four in 10 of the complaints made to AFCA about CAT221 were resolved at the very earliest stage<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-expectation-gap-remarks-to-the-insurance-council-of-australia-2024-annual-conference/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. This suggests that many of them could have been resolved in-house, much earlier, which would have been better for the consumer and for the insurers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recently collected data using our compulsory notice powers to assess general insurers&rsquo; compliance with their dispute resolution obligations, as set out in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-271-internal-dispute-resolution/" title="RG 271 Internal dispute resolution">RG 271</a>&nbsp;&ndash; our regulatory guidance on internal dispute resolution, which has a number of mandatory provisions. We expect to publish our findings from this review towards the end of this calendar year.</p>
<p>Alongside that, insurers are also now required to report to ASIC every six months on their internal dispute resolution data.&nbsp;We will soon be publishing some initial insights from that data collection across the financial services sector.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that next year, it&rsquo;s our intention to move towards more granular reporting of that data at a firm level, with the expectation that the additional transparency this provides will drive improvements in the way in which individual firms manage their complaints.</p>
<h3>Expectation 3: Consumer vulnerability</h3>
<p>Finally, we are particularly concerned about the way businesses respond to people experiencing vulnerability.</p>
<p>Our review last year suggested that some insurers were systematically under-identifying vulnerability in home insurance claims.</p>
<p>Identifying vulnerability is a critical first step in being able to respond effectively.</p>
<p>This is in a context where I think it is fair to say that there is an increasing community and parliamentary expectation around how major financial firms in general respond to customer vulnerability.</p>
<p>I would expect those expectations to continue to rise &ndash; so the more work<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW222061180 BCX8">&nbsp;insurers can do</span>&nbsp;on this now, the better prepared you&rsquo;ll be to respond to those increasing pressures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of what we mean by vulnerability, at ASIC it&rsquo;s our view that anyone can become vulnerable &ndash; at any point and for any reason.</p>
<p>Many of the customers that your teams deal with day-to-day fall into this category &ndash; not because of some inherent characteristics of who they are necessarily, but perhaps because of where they are at in that moment.</p>
<p>They might have lost their home.</p>
<p>They might be in an abusive situation or relationship.</p>
<p>Or they might be dealing with the psychological and social impacts of a major event.</p>
<p>We expect insurers to be proactively looking for signs of vulnerability and responding appropriately to individuals experiencing it.</p>
<p>Insurers should expect the way in which they respond to vulnerability of customers to be an area of continued interest to ASIC in our regulatory and enforcement work.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I would like to end with a note about the current floods inquiry &ndash; and in particular about the hundreds of Australians have who shared their stories through it.</p>
<p>ASIC has followed that inquiry really closely but our interest won&rsquo;t end with the publication of the report, which is anticipated on Friday.</p>
<p>We remain concerned about the number of claims still outstanding from 2022 events.</p>
<p>We do acknowledge that almost 99% of those claims from CAT221 have been closed<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/the-expectation-gap-remarks-to-the-insurance-council-of-australia-2024-annual-conference/?altTemplate=betanewsroom#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. That&rsquo;s no small feat.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the near 1% still outstanding equates to more than 1,800 claims.</p>
<p>Each unresolved claim represents an individual or family who can&rsquo;t move on with their lives. We feel that it is time to give them closure.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, insurance is complex - we understand that - but your customers&rsquo; expectations are often quite simple. Listening and responding to those expectations is critical to rebuilding trust and confidence in the industry &ndash; and to giving your customers the consistently good experience that they deserve.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="component-text">JSCC conducted its PoC to design and develop a cross-industry and cross-product collateral ecosystem by making full use of the DLT platform "DTCC Digital Launchpad" provided by DTCC and open source software (OSS).<br /><br />When we imagine that innovative changes will take place, this is JSCC's mid to long-term PoC to explore with even traditional financial products how the expansion of tokenization in post-trade processing across global financial markets will create new value, how insurmountable issues until now can be resolved, and what a globally harmonized ecosystem could truly look like.<br /><br />Since central clearing counterparties (CCPs) are the largest receivers of collateral due to their purpose of centrally managing risk and contributing to the robustness of markets, CCPs should explore the possibilities and potential of streamlining and optimizing collateral schemes using digital assets. Such schemes should not be fragmented, but globally standardized and interoperable. Against this background, JSCC believes it is meaningful for global financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to work together in conducting a future-oriented PoC.<br /><br />Looking ahead, other areas of potential exploration include use cases such as collateral exchanges between digital assets issued across different cross-border networks (interoperable atomic swaps) and lifecycle event processing of digital assets held as collateral (advancements with bond coupon and stock dividend payments).</p>

<div> SEC, private credit, lending, market regulation, risk

Summary:
- Private credit is familiar bilateral lending to corporate borrowers, managed by fund advisers and legal framework.
- Rapid growth may require scrutiny for transparency, valuation, default risk, and systemic risks.
- Existing regulatory tools and market discipline can address risks associated with private credit growth.
- Banks provide support to private credit, and non-bank sectors enhance systemic resilience through distinct funding models.
- Increased retail investor access to private credit may require further monitoring and liquidity management. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Joe [Seidel] for that introduction, and thanks to Mayer Brown and SIFMA for hosting today&rsquo;s event. It is a timely event, and I look forward to the discussion. Before I begin, I must remind you that my views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the Securities and Exchange Commission or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend and I went for an evening walk in the neighborhood. When we turned around to head back, the path was deserted and dark. Ahead of us we saw the outline of a large animal. It sat motionless in the middle of the path and watched us approach. My friend and I debated what it might be. It must be something dangerous&mdash;a gigantic, rabid raccoon, a hungry coyote, a small bear? Why else was it just sitting there, waiting for us without any sign of fear? We discussed what to do. Though the walk had already lasted longer than I wanted, and turning away from the creature in our path would require a lengthy detour, fear of the beast ahead prevailed. We began to retrace our steps so that we could take an alternate route. Then a couple appeared with a dog in tow. They were heading down the path toward us and toward that terrifying creature, to which our backs were now turned. &ldquo;May we walk with you?&rdquo; we asked with quivering voices, &ldquo;Because, you see, there is a dangerous animal on the path, and maybe your dog will scare him off.&rdquo; They acquiesced, but also informed us that the source of our terror was Thomas, their pet cat.</p>
<p>Apparently, Thomas was waiting for his family to return from their walk, not waiting to attack my friend and me. As we approached, Thomas the tame cat turned from us without giving us a second glance and happily followed his owners home. Our imaginations had transformed a harmless cat into a dangerous animal. Had we shone our phones&rsquo; flashlights on the object of our fear, we would have discovered Thomas&rsquo;s true nature without terrifying ourselves unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Private credit is a bit like Thomas. When we look at it from a distance, it seems scary, unfamiliar, and large. Surely, it will do us harm. Shouldn&rsquo;t we turn back and seek a different path? In reality, Thomas was a mere housecat. Upon closer inspection, private credit is familiar too, as are the associated risks. Private credit has grown rapidly in recent years and still is growing,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;but it is not a new phenomenon. Private credit is just bilateral lending to corporate borrowers, which has been around for ages&mdash;longer than public credit markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The current form of private credit has existed for three decades or more.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;We know how private lending works and the risks associated with it. We should seek to understand today&rsquo;s private credit, the new forms it is taking, and the attendant risks. But we should not build it up into a monster of our own imagination. Doing so may cause us to run away from an efficient, effective, and economically useful form of finance. I hope today&rsquo;s discussion will serve, as a flashlight would have on that night&rsquo;s walk, to put private credit in a more realistic, and less terrifying light.</p>
<p>Private credit generally refers to private companies borrowing money other than from banks or bank-led syndicates, or through the public markets, for example, from institutional investors through funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The private credit market is estimated to be $1.7 to $2 trillion worldwide.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Given the ever-expanding iterations of private credit, those numbers are imprecise and growing. Most borrowers are smaller - and mid-sized companies, but large companies also are joining the ranks of borrowers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Lenders are often private closed-end funds<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;whose investors include pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, family offices, and wealthy individual investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The average loan is less than $100 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Private credit is a form of relationship lending: investors and borrowers typically negotiate bilaterally, which allows for bespoke credit arrangements and other tools to meet borrowers&rsquo; and creditors&rsquo; distinctive needs.</p>
<p>Private credit has several beneficial features. It provides corporations a financing alternative to equity financing, bank financing, broadly syndicated loans, and the public bond markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;It diversifies investors&rsquo; portfolios, while offering them stable, attractive returns. Because private credit is not standardized, it affords flexibility to accommodate innovative arrangements, loan sizes, and terms that meet a borrower&rsquo;s particular needs. Creditors can negotiate for their desired level of disclosure and credit protection. Borrowers benefit from a shorter underwriting timeline and streamlined due diligence, as compared with bank loans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;They also enjoy more privacy and greater certainty of execution than they would have in the public markets. Due to the limited secondary market liquidity, lenders generally retain their loans until they either mature or are refinanced.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Private credit can foster a better partnership between businesses and creditors than other forms of financing.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Loan contracts can include protections for creditors, including a &ldquo;structured equity component, high prepayment penalties, or a role for the lender in the oversight or management of the business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Because of the direct relationship with the borrower (and perhaps also with the associated private equity firm), if the borrower runs into trouble, working out a deal with the lender may be easier than it is in other types of financing arrangements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Private credit&rsquo;s rapid growth is partly due to the imposition of stricter capital and lending standards on traditional banks in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. As banks reduced lending to smaller- and medium-sized companies, private credit stepped in to help fill the gap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The regional bank failures of spring 2023 and the supervisory and regulatory response to those failures may have opened a new lending gap for private credit to fill.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Other factors, such as increased private equity activity in the middle market and success of private credit funds in raising capital, also are important in the growth of private credit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The growth in private credit understandably has drawn policymakers&rsquo; attention. While financial regulators have not concluded that private credit is an&nbsp;<i>immediate&nbsp;</i>financial risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;many nevertheless have expressed concern about longer-term risks arising from the growth in private credit. Common regulatory concerns stem from, among other things, the absence of prudential regulation for private credit funds;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;questions about the reliability of private credit valuations given the lack of a secondary market;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;the relative riskiness of private credit borrowers;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;deteriorating credit quality and weaker creditor protections due to a surplus of investable capital;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;rising defaults in floating rate debt due to rising interest rates or an economic downturn;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;potential transmission of private credit losses to private fund counterparties, the financial system, and the broader economy;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;procyclical liquidity demands made by private credit funds to their investors;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;the increasing involvement of retail investors;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;hidden leverage;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;and interconnections with banks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;Exacerbating these concerns is a perceived lack of regulatory transparency into the private credit markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Just as my shadowy cat turned out to be something familiar, closer scrutiny puts these concerns about private credit into proper perspective. A careful look suggests that we do not need a new regulatory solution to address concerns related to private credit. Existing regulatory tools, paired with unflinching market discipline, suffice to deal with the risks associated with private credit.</p>
<p>The way private credit markets are regulated is a strength. Prudentially regulated entities, such as banks<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;and insurance companies, participate in the private credit markets, but private credit funds and advisers to those funds are regulated by the SEC under a mostly non-prudential framework.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;In being driven by non-banks, private credit is not an outlier. Much of America&rsquo;s capital formation occurs outside of the prudentially regulated banking system,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;and that is a good thing. Non-banks are more dynamic, more flexible, more nimble, and more responsive than banks to the needs of providers and takers of capital. They are correspondingly less responsive than prudentially regulated banks to the desires of regulators. An orientation to the needs of other market participants, rather than to the one-size-fits-all mandates of prudential regulators, enables non-bank private credit lenders to offer tailored lending solutions to borrowers, some of which are risky. The absence of prudential regulation also fosters a healthy heterogeneity in market practices and market participants&rsquo; behavior, which supports systemic resilience. Fundamentally, moving the risks associated with credit off bank balance sheets with their government backstop and into the capital markets, where fund investors&rsquo; equity is the backstop, enhances systemic resilience.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Lock-ups and other restrictions on private investor redemptions mitigate run risk. Private credit funds typically match the duration of their assets and liabilities by drawing capital from long-term investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;Most private credit funds are closed-end funds with terms of approximately five years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;Investors face withdrawal restrictions, which create a stable capital base.</p>
<p>Although private credit has performed well, even during times of stress, default<i>&nbsp;</i>risk in private credit is real.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;The borrowers are often small- to medium-sized companies that are risky, and changes in economic conditions or interest rates can amplify the risk. Private credit has solutions here too. Because private credit lenders typically hold loans until maturity, rather than originate loans to distribute them as banks often do,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;they have an incentive to conduct thorough due diligence, negotiate strong covenants,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;and devise workable solutions if borrowers cannot pay.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;Investors who add private credit because of its high returns can expect to absorb some losses,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;but their losses are not a concern to the broader economy, and private credit is typically only a small piece of a diversified portfolio. Private credit fund advisers know how to&mdash;and have the incentive and ability&mdash;to mitigate default risk ex ante through diversification, disclosure requirements, and other creditor protections and to restructure loans that have gone bad.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;While the popularity of the asset class has pulled in a lot of capital, which could lead to lower credit quality loans and weaker creditor protections, professional managers have fiduciary duties to the private credit funds they manage. Loan covenants do not appear to be deteriorating meaningfully, though that is something for investors to keep an eye on, and private credit increasingly serves larger and investment-grade borrowers.</p>
<p>Inaccurate valuations are also a real concern, but likewise not a cause for excessive worry. The lack of a secondary market and the bespoke nature of private credit make valuing outstanding loans difficult.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>&nbsp;Risks associated with valuation are mitigated, however, by the long-term nature of private credit investing; private credit funds generally hold loans until they are paid off or refinanced. Moreover, as private credit finds its way into publicly traded vehicles, such as BDCs or private credit exchange-traded funds, public markets will be able to test valuations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></p>
<p>Concerns that problems in the private credit markets will spill into the financial system and broader economy are the latest iteration of the incessant systemic risk critiques of asset managers, hedge funds, and registered investment companies. Prudential regulators almost reflexively look askance at the non-bank sector because it intentionally elevates private decision-making over regulatory decision-making. Asset managers, funds, and investors are a wonderful cacophony of market participants, each marching to its own drummer. While the idiosyncratic nature of the private credit markets makes it hard to neatly categorize and study, it also is a crucial aspect of the sector&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Market participants have ways to protect themselves that also protect the broader financial system. Private fund counterparties, including banks with the oversight of their regulators, can implement risk mitigants to prevent the transmission of private credit losses. Lock-up periods and other limitations on withdrawals avert runs on private credit funds. Investors in private credit funds may face procyclical capital calls during times of stress, but investors know their exposure ahead of time and so can plan for it. Retail investor access to this asset class may occur through publicly traded funds.</p>
<p>Banks not only compete with, but support and benefit from the private credit market. Banks lend money to private credit funds, transfer risk from their balance sheets to private credit funds, and set up joint private credit ventures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>&nbsp;Private credit funds generally operate with less leverage than banks, which protects them and the broader financial system.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a>&nbsp;As the relationships between private credit funds and banks evolve, we should watch for hidden leverage, regulatory arbitrage, and hidden interconnections with banks, but the heterogeneity of those arrangements protects against a system-wide problem. In general, we should welcome the movement of risk from bank balance sheets to private credit funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>&nbsp;To keep things in perspective, despite the growth in recent years, private credit is considerably smaller than the banking sector.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a></p>
<p>Although private credit seems to show more promise than peril, as a growing sector of the market, it deserves scrutiny from market participants, academics, and regulators. Using the tools we already have, we can monitor the private credit space as it expands and evolves. The public, creditors, and regulators already have information about the private credit markets. As the sector grows, public analyses of the market have proliferated. Creditors can negotiate substantial access to information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>&nbsp;Bank regulators and supervisors can look at banks&rsquo; relationships with private credit funds. Form PF, which the SEC recently expanded twice over my objection,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>&nbsp;provides detailed information to FSOC, the SEC, and the CFTC about certain private funds, including information relevant to private credit, investment losses, and fund outflows. But some regulators want more.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>&nbsp;To stretch my walk analogy past its breaking point, they want to turn on the flood lights to illuminate the entire neighborhood instead of pulling out the phone lights we already have to look at particular items of interest. Why should regulators have more detailed information about bilateral relationships between lenders and their borrowers? The creditors in these transactions can negotiate for the transparency they need to assess their risk and deal with problems as they arise. What precisely would the government do with such information, if it had it? Design a bailout for private credit funds during a wave of defaults? I hope not. After all, one of the strengths of the non-bank financial system is its absence of a federal safety net, which has a way of focusing minds on risk management.</p>
<p>Invoking systemic risk to regulate private credit in the same way we regulate bank lending would engender risks of its own. Doing so would squelch the dynamism that enables the non-bank sector to serve companies and investors so well. It would homogenize the market, which could make future financial contagion more, not less, likely. It would construct yet another obstacle to small business access to capital.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>&nbsp;If anything, the growing private credit sector may highlight the need for streamlining our&nbsp;<i>public&nbsp;</i>market regulation. I have expressed concerns about the costs of accessing our public equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-private-credit-forum-101524#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>&nbsp;We should ask similar questions about our public debt markets. Publicly traded bonds are not right for every company at every stage of its life, and private credit is sometimes the right solution when bonds are not. But can we do anything to improve the way the bond markets work so that they serve more companies than they do now?</p>
<p>When I think back to that evening stroll marred by my fear of Thomas, I am a bit embarrassed at my there-is-a-monster-under-the-bed approach to the situation. A calmer method to discerning what I was seeing would have served me better. We ought never to be ashamed about keeping our eyes out for unusual features looming in the financial landscape or about asking whether those features carry risks that are not being taken into account by market participants. But in doing so we must assess problems and design solutions rationally rather than cowering in fear at a what turns out to be a domesticated cat&rsquo;s silhouette. I look forward to further discussion of these issues on the panels ahead.</p>

<div> enforcement action, civil monetary penalties, restitution, fraud, misappropriation <br />
Summary:<br /> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a civil enforcement action against multiple companies and individuals for fraudulent solicitation of funds and misappropriation. <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Traders Domain FX LTD. d/b/a The Traders Domain</span>, a St. Vincent and the Grenadines company with principal operations in Canada, and its two co-founders,&nbsp;<span>Fredirick Teddy Joseph Safranko, a/k/a Ted Safranko</span>, of Ontario or British Columbia, Canada, and&nbsp;<span>David William Negus-Romvari</span>&nbsp;of Ontario, Canada and Mexico</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Ares Global Ltd. d/b/a Trubluefx</span>, a Saint Lucia company</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Algo Capital LLC</span>, a Florida company</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Algo FX Capital Advisor LLC n/k/a Quant5 Advisor LLC.</span>, a Delaware company with principal operations in Medley, Florida, and four of their officers and agents including&nbsp;<span>Robert Collazo Jr.</span>&nbsp;of Miami Lakes, Florida<span>, Juan Jose Herman a/k/a/ JJ Herman</span>&nbsp;of Miami, John Fortini of North Miami, Florida, and&nbsp;<span>Stephen Likos</span>&nbsp;of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Michael Shannon Sims</span>&nbsp;of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Holton Buggs Jr.</span>, of Houston</span></span></li>
<li class="BulletedHyperlink"><span><span><span>Centurion Capital Group Inc.</span>, a Florida company, and three of its officers and agents including&nbsp;<span>Alejandro Santiestaban a/k/a Alex Santi, Gabriel Beltran</span>, both of Hialeah, Florida, and&nbsp;<span>Archie Rice&nbsp;</span>of Fulshear, Texas&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>The complaint alleges that, among other things, the defendants individually, and at times working in conjunction, made material fraudulent representations to their customers and misappropriated customer funds. In sum, more than 2,000 customers deposited no less than $283 million in connection with the alleged fraud.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, restitution, trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On Oct. 3, Federal District Court Judge Roy K. Altman entered a statutory restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and giving the CFTC immediate access to their books and records. The court scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for Oct. 29.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The complaint alleges from at least November 2019 through the present, TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari orchestrated a multi-layered scheme to solicit funds for trading leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, specifically gold-to-U.S. dollar pairs (XAU/USD), as well as assorted other commodities, through pooled and individual accounts.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The complaint states TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari<span>&nbsp;</span>made fraudulent and material oral and written misrepresentations and omissions, and misappropriated customer funds. The complaint alleges TD and Safranko falsified trading records and TD&rsquo;s successor, Trubluefx, further misappropriated customer funds by failing to refund the money despite repeated attempts by thousands of customers to access and/or liquidate their accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to the complaint, TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari also used other individuals and entities (sponsors) on TD&rsquo;s behalf, with each sponsor acting like a spoke extending from the TD hub.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The sponsors Algo Capital and Algo FX Capital Advisor n/k/a Quant5, and their agents Collazo, Herman, Fortini, and Likos; Sims; Buggs; and Centurion, and its agents Santi, Beltran, and Rice, also fraudulently solicited customers and misappropriated funds. The sponsors actively downplayed red flags and continued to solicit customers, helping to create the false impression customers were participating in legitimate trading even as the scheme was on the brink of collapse.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the fall of 2022, customers began to experience extreme withdrawal delays and/or were unable to withdraw their funds. According to the complaint, TD, Safranko, and Negus-Romvari, and the sponsor defendants provided numerous, conflicting excuses for the delays &mdash; falsely assuring customers their funds were safe, and withdrawals would be processed. All while the sponsor defendants continued to solicit funds from new and existing customers to be traded in the TD Pool, allowing the defendants to continue their fraudulent scheme for more than six months and bilk customers out of millions of additional dollars.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the&nbsp;assistance of the National Futures Association, Ontario Securities Commission, the Financial Services Authority Saint Vincent &amp; The Grenadines, Finantsinspektsioon (Estonian Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority), and Vanuatu Financial&nbsp;Services Commission.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Alison B. Wilson, Sean Hennessy, Sarah Wastler, Kelly Folks, Maura Viehmeyer, Michelle Bougas, Erica Bodin, Stephanie Cooper, and Rick Glaser. Jeremy Christianson and Christopher Beatty from the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Data and Technology also assisted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>CFTC&rsquo;s Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/fraudadv_commoditypool.html">Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory</a>, which&nbsp;provides information&nbsp;about a type of fraud involving individuals and firms, often unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.&nbsp;The&nbsp;CFTC&nbsp;also urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>&nbsp;before investing funds. If an entity is unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, should be reported to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint&nbsp;</a>online or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">CFTC Whistleblower Office</a>.&nbsp;Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</span></span></p>

<title>US Federal And State Financial Regulatory Agencies Issue Interagency Statement On Supervisory Practices Regarding Financial Institutions Affected By Hurricane Milton</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-and-state-financial-regulatory-agencies-issue-interagency-statement-o-11/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-and-state-financial-regulatory-agencies-issue-interagency-statement-o-11/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Hurricane Milton, regulatory assistance, lending, temporary facilities, publishing requirements<br />
Summary: The agencies provide regulatory assistance, encourage lending to affected areas, expedite temporary facility requests, offer CRA consideration, and encourage monitoring investments.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, collectively the agencies, recognize the serious impact of Hurricane Milton on the customers and operations of many financial institutions and will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to affected institutions subject to their supervision. The agencies encourage institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>A complete list of the current disaster areas can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations</a>.</p>
<p><span>Lending:</span>&nbsp;The agencies encourage financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers in communities affected by Hurricane Milton. Prudent efforts to adjust or alter terms on existing loans in affected areas are supported by the agencies and should not be subject to examiner criticism. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, institutions should individually evaluate modifications of existing loans to determine whether they represent troubled debt restructurings or modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as applicable. In making this evaluation, institutions should consider the facts and circumstances of each borrower and modification. In supervising institutions affected by Hurricane Milton, the agencies will consider the unusual circumstances these institutions face. The agencies recognize that efforts to work with borrowers in communities under stress can be consistent with safe-and-sound practices as well as in the public interest.</p>
<p><span>Temporary Facilities:</span>&nbsp;The agencies understand that many financial institutions face staffing, power, telecommunications, and other challenges in re-opening facilities after Hurricane Milton. In cases in which operational challenges persist, the primary federal and/or state regulator will expedite, as appropriate, any request to operate temporary facilities to provide more convenient availability of services to those affected by Hurricane Milton. In most cases, a telephone notice to the primary federal and/or state regulator will suffice initially to start the approval process, with necessary written notification being submitted shortly thereafter.</p>
<p><span>Publishing Requirements:</span>&nbsp;The agencies understand that the damage caused by Hurricane Milton may affect compliance with publishing and other requirements for branch closings, relocations, and temporary facilities under various laws and regulations. Institutions experiencing disaster-related difficulties in complying with any publishing or other requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator.</p>
<p><span>Regulatory Reporting Requirements:</span>&nbsp;Institutions affected by Hurricane Milton that expect to encounter difficulty meeting the agencies&rsquo; reporting requirements should contact their primary federal and/or state regulator to discuss their situation. The agencies do not expect to assess penalties or take other supervisory action against institutions that take reasonable and prudent steps to comply with the agencies&rsquo; regulatory reporting requirements if those institutions are unable to fully satisfy those requirements because of Hurricane Milton.</p>
<p>The agencies&rsquo; staffs stand ready to work with affected institutions that may be experiencing problems fulfilling their reporting responsibilities, taking into account each institution&rsquo;s particular circumstances, including the status of its reporting and recordkeeping systems and the condition of its underlying financial records.</p>
<p><span>Community Reinvestment Act (CRA):</span>&nbsp;Financial institutions may receive CRA consideration for community development loans, investments, or services that revitalize or stabilize federally designated disaster areas in their assessment areas or in the states or regions that include their assessment areas. For additional information, refer to the Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Community Reinvestment at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm</a>.</p>
<p><span>Investments:</span>&nbsp;Institutions are encouraged to monitor municipal securities and loans affected by Hurricane Milton. The agencies realize local government projects may be negatively affected by the disaster and encourage institutions to engage in appropriate monitoring and take prudent efforts to stabilize such investments.</p>

<div> EBA, EIOPA, ESMA, registers, DORA<br />
Summary: The European Supervisory Authorities raised concerns over the proposed changes to the draft Implementing Technical Standards on the registers of information under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). They reject the addition of the European Unique Identifier (EUID) and call for further changes to the draft ITS. The ESAs also call for the swift adoption of the draft ITS by the EC and for financial entities to increase their implementation efforts. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) today issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/JC_2024_75_-_Opinion_on_the_rejection_of_the_ITS_on_RoI_under_DORA.pdf">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC)&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d7f731c6-39a7-42e5-bd4b-f28434b7d51d_en?filename=240723-letter-esma-dora-register-information_en.pdf">rejection</a>&nbsp;of the draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the registers of information under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). The ESAs raise concerns over the impacts and practicalities of the proposed EC changes to the draft ITS on the registers of information in relation to financial entities&rsquo; contractual arrangements&nbsp;<a>with ICT third-party service providers.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The&nbsp;draft ITS proposed by the ESAs were&nbsp;rejected&nbsp;by the EC on the&nbsp;grounds that it is necessary to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;financial entities&nbsp;the choice of identifying their ICT third-party service providers&nbsp;registered in the EU&nbsp;either&nbsp;by using the&nbsp;Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)&nbsp;or by using&nbsp;the European Unique Identifier (EUID).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the ESAs view, the EC&rsquo;s proposal of adding an additional identifier, allowing EU-based companies to use the EUID, will cause unnecessary complexity and could have negative impacts on the implementation of DORA by financial entities, competent authorities and the ESAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ESAs note that, although the EUID is available free of charge to&nbsp;<a>EU-registered companies</a>, its introduction in the registers of information would entail unforeseen implementation and maintenance efforts for the financial entities. In particular, it would limit the access to and &nbsp;the possibility for verification of the information by the financial entities and competent authorities. This would lead to a potential increase in the overall reporting burden for financial entities in the context of DORA. In addition, the coexistence of two identifiers could bring additional complexity that would negatively impact the quality of data used, and risk delays in the designation of critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) by the ESAs.</p>
<p>If the EC decides to proceed with the introduction of the EUID<a>, despite the above</a>&nbsp;concerns,&nbsp;additional changes to the draft ITS will be necessary. The Opinion indicates how the&nbsp;draft ITS should be adapted&nbsp;further to cater for the use of the EUID.&nbsp;Without these changes, the ITS could not be&nbsp;practically&nbsp;applied for&nbsp;a proper&nbsp;identification of&nbsp;the ICT third-party service providers, which would negatively impact the designation of CTPPs. The ESAs also note that in the case of co-existence of both LEI and EUID, the financial entities should be given the preference for using LEI, especially where both identifiers are available to them, and for the case of groups, it is important to ensure homogeneity in the registered identification codes for all ICT third-party service providers.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The ESAs also suggest&nbsp;in their Opinion&nbsp;further changes to the&nbsp;draft&nbsp;ITS, reflecting the practical feedback received from financial entities participating in the voluntary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/direct-supervision-and-oversight/digital-operational-resilience-act/preparation-dora-application">dry run exercise on reporting of registers of information</a>.</p>
<p>The ESAs call for the final decision on the use of identifiers and the swift adoption of the draft ITS by the EC. This is particularly relevant for the ESAs, who will be designating CTPPs in 2025. Finally, leveraging on the experience of the dry run exercise, the ESAs call financial entities to increase their implementation efforts in order to be ready to submit their registers of information to the competent authorities in the first half of 2025.</p>
<h4><span>Background and legal basis</span></h4>
<p><a>Article 28(9) of DORA (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) mandates the ESAs to develop draft ITS to establish the standard templates for the register of information referred to in Article 28(3) of DORA. The draft ITS was developed and submitted by the ESAs to the EU Commission on 17 January 2024.</a></p>
<p>The registers of information maintained by the financial entities serve as an important input for the ESAs&rsquo; work on the designation of CTPPs that will be subject to the oversight by the ESAs.</p>
<p>On 3 September 2024, the European Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure set out in the fourth subparagraph of Article 15(1) of the ESAs Regulations,&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d7f731c6-39a7-42e5-bd4b-f28434b7d51d_en?filename=240723-letter-esma-dora-register-information_en.pdf">notified the ESAs of the rejection of the ITS</a>&nbsp;on the basis of the envisaged mandatory use of the LEI to identify ICT third-party service providers under Article 3(5) and (6) of the draft ITS.</p>
<p><a>Pursuant to Article 15(4) of the ESAs Regulation, the ESAs prepared this Opinion on the proposed amendments to the draft ITS by the EU Commission. In addition, the ESAs also suggested some other changes to the draft ITS based on the experience and feedback received from the industry during &nbsp;the &lsquo;dry run&rsquo; exercise the ESAs carried out during 2024 to support the industry in the preparation for submission of the registers of information and to test the reporting process.</a></p>

<title>BIS: CPMI Reports To G20 On Fast Payment System Interlinking And APIs Provide Insights And Recommendations To Enhance Cross-Border Payments</title>

<div> interlinking, interoperability, fast payment systems, APIs, cross-border payments
Summary: The CPMI published reports on interlinking fast payment systems and harmonizing APIs for cross-border payments, offering key recommendations for governance and oversight. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li>CPMI publishes two reports offering insights into enhancing cross-border payments by facilitating the interlinking and interoperability of payment systems.</li>
<li>Report on the interlinking of fast payment systems aims to support private and public stakeholders when deciding on the governance and oversight of these arrangements.</li>
<li>Report on greater harmonisation of the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) sets out 10 key recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) today published two reports to the G20 that offer key insights and recommendations on the interlinking and interoperability of payment systems to enhance cross-border payments.</p>
<p><strong><em>Linking fast payment systems across borders: governance and oversight</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, fast payment systems (FPS) are designed and used mainly for domestic retail payments. Interlinking them across different jurisdictions could expand the end user experience of low-cost, fast, easy to access and transparent payments to the cross-border dimension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunities to foster cross-border FPS interlinking have grown with the proliferation of FPS globally and with trends towards greater interoperability at the technical level. The growing use of application programming interfaces (APIs) and the adoption of the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard have opened up new possibilities to facilitate payment system interlinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, agreeing on workable governance and oversight arrangements is challenging due to the multi-jurisdictional, cross-border and/or cross-currency nature of these arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on an earlier CPMI report that lays out the benefits and challenges of FPS interlinking and the role of APIs,<span><a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p241015.htm#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>1</span></a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d223.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Linking fast payment systems across borders: governance and oversight</em></a>&nbsp;discusses design choices and the risk implications of these arrangements, sets out the key decisions for governance and outlines recommendations for their oversight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Promoting the harmonisation of application programming interfaces to enhance cross-border payments: recommendations and toolkit</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs are increasingly used throughout the global financial system for various payment functions, enhancing the efficiency of payment data exchange. However, API technical standards are currently fragmented, hindering the potential of APIs in cross-border payments and leading to increased time and expenses, as well as higher risks of errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d224.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">Promoting</span>&nbsp;the harmonisation of application programming interfaces to enhance cross-border payments: recommendations and toolkit</a></em>&nbsp;presents 10 recommendations directed at a broad array of stakeholders. The recommendations were formulated in collaboration with industry through a CPMI-led panel of experts to promote greater harmonisation of APIs in cross-border payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommendations do not propose a single universal API standard for cross-border payments, nor do they prescribe specific technologies or standards. Rather, they aim to steer API standards in a more harmonised direction by promoting facilitative processes, adoption of best practice design and international data standards, enhancements to the developer experience, and a focus on pre-validation APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CPMI will continue its engagement with stakeholders to disseminate the findings of the two reports, facilitate their practical implementation and promote the interlinking of FPS for cross-border payments and harmonisation of APIs.&nbsp;</p>

<title>DTCC Announces Industry Sandbox To Support And Advance The Digital Asset Ecosystem - DTCC Also Announces Results Of Proof-Of-Concept To Optimize Collateral Management Using Tokenization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DTCC, digital assets, industry sandbox, collaboration, infrastructure <br />
Summary: DTCC launches a digital sandbox for industry collaboration and pilot projects to drive adoption of digital assets and create scalable solutions. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced DTCC Digital Launchpad, an industry sandbox intended to bring together financial market participants and clear the path to scalable adoption of digital assets. As an open ecosystem, DTCC Digital Launchpad will feature market participants, technology providers, and others working together to identify and collaborate on meaningful pilots that have a clear path to production.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DTCC Digital Launchpad will unify stakeholders from nearly every corner of the financial markets to solve the challenges facing adoption of digital asset technology,&rdquo; said Frank La Salla, DTCC President, CEO and Director. &ldquo;As an industry-owned and governed infrastructure for the world&rsquo;s largest capital markets, DTCC is uniquely suited to drive industry collaboration under the banner of a larger goal: building a digital asset ecosystem that&rsquo;s as safe and sound as the one we have for traditional securities today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Current estimates suggest tokenization presents a monumental business opportunity, with projections stating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gfma.org/policies-resources/gfma-publishes-report-on-impact-of-dlt-in-global-capital-markets" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$16 trillion dollars</span></a>&nbsp;in tokenized securities could be on digital rails by 2030. However, adoption of this technology has stalled as the industry continues working in silos. Most digital asset initiatives today have differing and conflicting standards, controls, and operational processes, leading to a fragmented digital landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached a critical inflection point in the adoption of digital asset technology, and DTCC is challenging the industry to rethink and reframe its siloed approach,&rdquo; said Nadine Chakar, Global Head of DTCC Digital Assets. &ldquo;The ultimate objective of DTCC Digital Launchpad is to bring the industry together to build production-ready, secure, and efficient digital market infrastructure and standards that will transform capital markets for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DTCC Digital Launchpad provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>DLT infrastructure featuring capabilities from the DTCC Digital Assets product suite. These capabilities help firms address some of the industry&rsquo;s biggest challenges around data, liquidity, and infrastructure, including interoperability and data harmonization</li>
<li>Robust and scalable infrastructure, enabling firms to get started on their digital asset journeys without having to build their own ecosystem</li>
<li>One platform, two objectives: 
<ul>
<li><span>Industry Launchpad:</span>&nbsp;An open ecosystem for broad collaboration. DTCC will publicize our prioritized pilots in Q1 2025, starting with an initial group of participants invited to co-develop these solutions. These initiatives are designed to unite the industry behind addressing critical pain points and paving the way for scalable solutions that drive industry-wide progress</li>
<li><span>Client Launchpad:</span>&nbsp;A dedicated space to leverage comprehensive digital asset capabilities from DTCC Digital Assets. Clients can explore and develop their own innovative use cases without substantial investment. DTCC&rsquo;s professional services team is on hand to offer guidance and provide product support to drive these initiatives to production</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DTCC today also announced the results of a recent proof-of-concept on DTCC Digital Launchpad. Led by Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC), clearinghouse of Japan Exchange Group, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/digital-assets/launchpad" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">proof-of-concept</span></a>&nbsp;explored how central counterparties (CCPs) could use tokenization to optimize the collateral management process for clearing members and their buy-side firms. In particular, it examined how margin calls and their associated processes could be automated, made more efficient and transparent for all participants using digital assets and smart contracts &ndash; or rules that automatically execute on a distributed ledger when certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JSCC is excited to share the results of our successful proof-of-concept, which demonstrated that digital assets and smart contracts technology could be leveraged to introduce operational and capital efficiencies for market participants in the collateral management process,&rdquo; said JSCC President &amp; CEO, Konuma Yasuyuki. &ldquo;By leveraging DTCC&rsquo;s reusable blockchain-based infrastructure, we were able to jump-start our proof-of-concept, easily issuing digital assets such as cash, stocks, and bonds without needing to develop our own infrastructure. This allowed us to shift our focus to the initiative&rsquo;s impact on our own business processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DTCC encourages the industry to read the results from JSCC, a key first step as the firm now invites the industry to explore how they can leverage DTCC Digital Launchpad to support large-scale initiatives in shared environments.</p>

<div> enhanced services, solution capabilities, operational resilience, DORA compliance, cyber-recovery<br />
<br />Summary:
Broadridge launches enhanced services for post-trade processing, ensuring compliance with DORA and international operational resilience regulations through professional services, high-availability recovery, and enhanced cyber-recovery capabilities. <div>
<p>In response to the increased sophistication and prevalence of cyber threats, and board mandates on operational resilience,&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4277680-1&amp;h=3299768447&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadridge.com%2F&amp;a=Broadridge+Financial+Solutions%2C+Inc." target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR) has launched a range of enhanced services and solution capabilities for international post-trade processing. These capabilities enable firms to comply with the European Union's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and other global regulations requiring a heightened level of operational resilience and are available to banks and brokers that currently use Broadridge's leading International Post-Trade processing solution, as well as to the wider industry to augment their inhouse or vendor systems and operational teams.</p>
<p><i>"The DORA compliance deadline is just three months away and the clock is ticking. Non-compliance will expose financial firms to an increased risk of cyber incidents, security breaches and system outages, as well as the potential for reputational damage and avoidable regulatory penalties,"</i>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<b>Danny Green, Head of International Post-Trade Solutions, Broadridge</b><i>.&nbsp;"It is vital that firms are advancing their plans for the timely completion of both inhouse and third-party system reviews, and that they have a robust strategy to meet their prescribed recovery time objectives (RTOs) for their operating model."</i></p>
<p>Broadridge's operational resilience services and solutions for international post-trade processing enable firms to mutualize the cost of ensuring business continuity in the face of growing cyber-attacks, and of complying with DORA and other international operational resilience mandates through a shared services pricing model that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Deeply knowledgeable professional services:</b>&nbsp;Specialized expertise and advanced analytical tools to assess and validate firms' risk and control frameworks relating to internal and third-party systems and service provider data. It includes thorough evaluations of current frameworks to identify potential vulnerabilities, validation of risk controls and recommendations for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of operational risk management practices.</li>
<li><b>High-availability recovery:</b>&nbsp;The provision of back-up environments that are the regulatory-prescribed distance away from a firm's primary site, and that meet recovery time objectives within the required timeframe and to the required standard in the event of a cyber-attack or outage.&nbsp; Broadridge's enhanced solution can reduce recovery times from hours to minutes.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced recovery of entire system infrastructure:&nbsp;</b>An enhanced cyber-recovery capability that can prevent the compromise of critical data assets in as robust a manner as possible.&nbsp; By deploying secure, immutable storage, Broadridge can support unalterable, point-in-time copies of a firm's international post-trade infrastructure including the operating system, post-trade software and critical data. In the event of a cyber incident, these secure, cyber-resilient copies can be swiftly restored to enable faster and easier system recovery.</li>

<br />
Adaptive partnered with EDX to build EDX Clearing, a cloud-native central clearinghouse for institutional crypto trading, reducing settlement risk and transaction costs. The platform offers modern design and functionality, a user-friendly interface, and interoperability with third-party tools. This allows EDX to independently manage and control future innovations. 
<br /><br />Summary: 
Adaptive partnered with EDX to build a cloud-native central clearinghouse for institutional crypto trading, reducing settlement risk and transaction costs, and providing a modern design and functionality, user-friendly interface, and interoperability with third-party tools. This allows EDX to independently manage and control future innovations. <div>
<p>Adaptive, the experts in custom trading technology solutions, today announced it partnered with EDX Markets, a digital assets technology firm, to develop and deliver EDX Clearing (EDXC), EDX&rsquo;s proprietary, cloud-native central clearinghouse.</p>
<p>EDXC is an end-to-end clearinghouse for EDX&rsquo;s institutional crypto marketplace. Adaptive worked closely with EDX to design and build its unique clearinghouse system to support all-to-all trading on EDX&rsquo;s marketplace while reducing settlement risk exposure and providing a superior trading experience. EDXC helps to reduce transaction costs and risk for members by netting all trades and operating a once-a-day settlement cycle rather than settling multiple times throughout the trading day with multiple counterparties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In less than five months, Adaptive and EDX utilized their comprehensive digital asset domain expertise to build the new clearinghouse on Amazon Web Services&rsquo; (AWS) cloud, including UX/UI design, end-to-end development, delivery management and SRE. The platform ensures greater resilience and enables EDX to scale its clearing operations alongside market growth. Key features of the new clearinghouse include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Functionality:&nbsp;</b>An institutional grade clearing and settlement solution with unique features, including core book and risk management functions.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li><b>User Experience:&nbsp;</b>A web-based clearing portal with an intuitive UI that provides reconciliation, reporting and administrative tools to EDX and its members.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Modern Design</b>: Complex functionality delivered through a modern architecture and technology stack running on AWS.</li>
<li><b>Interoperability:&nbsp;</b>Seamless integration with various third-party tools to respond quickly to emerging requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Matt Barrett, CEO of Adaptive said:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;Creating a bespoke cloud-based clearinghouse for a leading institutional crypto exchange is an important milestone for Adaptive. Working closely with EDX, we helped design and build a proprietary clearinghouse that allows the firm to take greater control of its technology, deliver enhanced benefits to clients and scale as the market evolves. The clearinghouse is an industry-leading achievement and showcases our team&rsquo;s efficiency and innovation &ndash; delivering a game-changing platform for a trailblazing digital assets business.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Tony Acu&ntilde;a-Rohter, CEO of EDX Clearing stated:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;With Adaptive's technical skills and deep understanding of digital asset trading, we were able to achieve an on-time and on-budget delivery of a cloud-based solution that sets new industry benchmarks. Our collaboration with Adaptive culminated in a state-of-the-art clearing system that redefines risk management and operational efficiency for institutional crypto markets, which has been pivotal in establishing EDX as a frontrunner in the new era of institutional crypto trading.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>With a central clearinghouse, EDX can independently manage and control the pace and focus of future innovations. Optimized for both simplicity and sophistication, EDX now offers a fully integrated marketplace and clearinghouse that addresses members' trading, clearing and settlement needs.</p>

<title>Spectrum Markets - Data Reveals: European Retail Investors Focus On Crude Oil Amid Middle East Tensions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SERIX data, bullish sentiment, crude oil, Spectrum Markets, retail investors <br />
Summary: Spectrum Markets' SERIX data shows bullish sentiment towards crude oil, driven by geopolitical tensions and supply concerns. Retail investor sentiment is positive. 36.9% of trades occurred outside traditional hours. <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum Markets&rsquo; monthly SERIX data reveals a bullish sentiment towards both major crude oil indices last month, with WTI at 111 and Brent at 108</li>
<li>Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, along with supply concerns, have led to a steady increase in sentiment related to crude oil since June 2024</li>
<li>Spectrum saw 36.9% of trades in September 2024 take place outside traditional European market hours, reflecting ongoing demand for 24/5 trading</li>
</ul>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for September, revealing a positive shift towards both major crude oil indices: WTI and Brent, at 111 and 108 respectively.</p>
<p>What stands out in September is the steady continuation of the upward trend in crude oil SERIX sentiment that began in June 2024, coinciding with escalating tensions in the Middle East. This trend seems to be driven by geopolitical instability, fueling market anxiety about supply shortages and associated price increases.</p>
<p><b>Market opinion</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Retail investor sentiment is showing a clear upward trend in line with rising oil prices. Geopolitical instability in the Middle East has undoubtedly played a significant role, fuelling concerns about potential supply disruptions, which have been reflected in the bullish outlook for crude oil,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The steady rise in SERIX values for both WTI and Brent highlights a shift in sentiment, as investors look to oil as a key asset amid broader market uncertainties. With the energy market continuing to experience volatility, we expect this interest in crude oil to persist,&rdquo; Hall concludes.</p>
<p><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s September data</b></p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p>In September 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;242.4 million, with 36.9% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 78.1% on indices, 3.5% on currency pairs, 11.9% on commodities, 3.4% on equities and 3.1% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (27.8%), DAX 40 (24.8%), and DOW 30 (13.4%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the NASDAQ 100 shifted from neutral to a bullish 101, while both the DOW 30 and DAX 40 remained bearish at 98.</p>
<p><img alt="Spectrum_15Sep24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Spectrum_15Sep24.jpg" title="Spectrum_15Sep24" /></p>
<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded. (For a detailed methodology and examples, please visit this <a href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/the-venue/spectrum-european-retail-investor-index?utm_source=Press%20Release%20-%20EN&amp;utm_medium=SERIX%20LINK&amp;utm_campaign=May%20Volumes%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_content=">link</a>).</p>

<div> launch, ESG disclosure, Malaysia, SC, World Bank <br />
The joint SC-World Bank report on ESG disclosure in Malaysia recommends policy development, showcases good corporate disclosures, and highlights gaps. It aims to foster a sustainable capital market.<br /><br />Summary: The report analyzes ESG reporting practices in Malaysia, provides recommendations for policy development, highlights gaps in environmental indicators, and aims to strengthen ESG practices among domestic investors. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and the World Bank have launched a joint report, &ldquo;ESG Disclosure Assessment of Malaysia&rsquo;s Listed Companies and Recommendations for Policy Development&rdquo; at the SC-World Bank Conference 2024 today.</p>
<p>This report provides a baseline on ESG reporting practice in Malaysia, offering key insights for companies and investors to enhance sustainability reporting to align with international best practices and remain competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It aims to analyse the current state of ESG disclosure amongst listed companies and institutional investors, given the growing prominence of ESG and sustainability investments globally.</p>
<p>It also provides reflections and recommendations for policymakers in the Malaysian capital market to foster improved ESG reporting, ensuring relevance and consistency globally.</p>
<p>Speaking at the conference, SC Executive Director of Islamic Capital Market Sharifatul Hanizah Said Ali emphasised the importance of strengthening ESG disclosures amid growing global demand for sustainable investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This joint report reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering a more sustainable capital market. Improved ESG disclosure practices are expected to strengthen investor confidence and ensure that our market remains competitive and future-ready,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The report was based on an in-depth assessment, conducted between August and December 2023, examining ESG disclosure practices of a representative sample of 90 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia, as well as processes among some of Malaysia's largest asset owners.</p>
<p>It highlights that most Malaysian listed companies had demonstrated good corporate disclosures and solid overall approach to managing governance and social issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the report also points out gaps in specific environmental indicators, especially those related to climate change and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Other findings from the report include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Larger companies<sup>1</sup> had significantly better ESG disclosure rates than smaller ones. </li>
<li>Regulatory compliance was the primary driver of corporate ESG reporting in Malaysia. </li>
<li>On ESG disclosure practices among four large Malaysian asset owners, the assessment indicated relatively low levels of ESG disclosure. However, interviews suggested greater efforts to strengthen ESG practices and processes other than currently publicly disclosed. </li>
</ol>
<p>The report concludes with a set of recommendations, including continuous monitoring along with consultations, to ensure effective implementation of the ESG disclosures in line with the recently launched National Sustainability Reporting Framework (NSRF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other recommendations of the report include:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>To further support widespread implementation of Bursa Malaysia&rsquo;s guidelines for sustainability reporting </li>
<li>To actively encourage development of ESG practices among domestic investors to increase appeal for corporate ESG disclosures </li>
</ol>
<p>This year marks the 5th installment of the SC-World Bank Conference, which was officiated by Deputy Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry YB Liew Chin Tong.</p>
<p>The conference explores synergies within the capital market and Islamic capital market to bridge funding gaps for micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) and mid-tier companies (MTCs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It aligns with the SC&rsquo;s 5-year Roadmap &ldquo;Catalysing MSME and MTC Access to the Capital Market (2024-2028)&rdquo;, which aims to support MSMEs and MTCs funding through the capital market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through our knowledge-based collaboration, we aim to support effective policy design and implementation to address the MSME and climate financing gaps, and I look forward to further leveraging the World Bank&rsquo;s global expertise to support the Malaysian government, financial regulators, and the private sector in developing a more robust and resilient financing ecosystem for MSMEs,&rdquo; said Dr. Zafer Mustafaoğlu, World Bank Country Director for the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam.</p>
<p>Over 200 industry players attended the conference, including entrepreneurs, government agencies, venture capital and private equity firms, RMOs, financial institutions, and Government-Linked Investment Companies.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Capital Markets, Regulation, Climate Related Disclosures, Liquidity Risk Management, FinTech<br />
Summary: The FMA is committed to supporting changes in capital markets, adapting to regulations, addressing climate-related disclosures, managing liquidity risk, and fostering innovation in FinTech. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>E ngā mana, e ngā waka, e ngā reo, e rau Rangatira mā,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tēna koutou katoa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for having me speak to you all today, and a big thank you to INFINZ and staff for hosting this event. It was a pleasure to be a part of your annual dinner earlier this year, celebrating amazing personal and team achievements, and I&rsquo;m delighted to have the opportunity to be here to speak to you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you too, Michael, for those fascinating insights on the art of changing minds. This is incredibly useful, because some of what we strive to do as a regulator is exactly that, changing minds. Our engagement-led approach is about engaging with industry, nudging, guiding, steering, and sometimes directing, using all the soft and hard powers we have at our disposal. It&rsquo;s also about engaging and informing consumers as well, to try to encourage people to make thoughtful, good decisions as they save, invest and plan for their financial futures &ndash; so they understand their options and the opportunities and risks involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Capital Markets changes</h3>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure many of you are aware, the future of regulation for New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets is currently being discussed across Government, industry and regulators. There are several meetings happening on a regular basis in preparation for a Ministerial decision on reforms. I know some of you in the room are heavily involved in that process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how is the FMA approaching this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re approaching it from the principle of being open with all our stakeholders, setting out our positions and the reasons for those. In several areas, we&rsquo;ve indicated strong comfort with making changes or supporting changes to make it easier for firms to raise capital, and where rules and regulations have been shown to be unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, as I have said before publicly, the FMA had provided the Minister with a list of rules and regulations which we feel are not needed, are a regulatory burden on firms, and sometimes aren&rsquo;t a good use of our resources, such as renewing exemptions every five years. This is an important part of our job &ndash; to keep the laws around financial markets under review. It is something we have been doing for a long-time and will continue to do so into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that this can never be a free for all, burning of the regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are fundamental investor protections that need to remain in place, and we will look to ensure those protections are retained and enhanced. For example, the work we have done and continue to do on the inappropriate use of the wholesale eligible investor regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These fundamental matters include protections for retail investors that were put in place following the global financial crisis and collapse of New Zealand&rsquo;s finance companies. We must not forget the harm caused to those investors and the detrimental impact on trust and confidence in our financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust in the financial sector is critical, and it is why scams have such a damaging impact. As I am sure you are all aware, they are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. The funds management sector is not immune. We are seeing a significant uptick in investment scams. All of us across the industry must be extra vigilant to safeguard investors from this risk. It is not going away, and prevention is key.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We consider scam detection and avoidance to be a vital component of a firm&rsquo;s operational resilience. The obligation to exercise professional care, diligence and skill in the best interests of investors extends to scams. I know a reassuringly large number of you take this very seriously, but I want to emphasise, all providers need to take this extremely seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Climate Related Disclosures</h3>
<p>There are also ongoing discussions on Climate Related Disclosures, including the standard setter, the XRB. Being one of the first countries in the world to introduce a CRD regime comes with inevitable challenges, as there isn&rsquo;t the luxury of learning from those who came before us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, with a large portion of entities now having published their first climate statements, it&rsquo;s understandable that we take a moment to look at how it&rsquo;s working. XRB recently published their consultation document on climate standards. I encourage you to provide your feedback by the end of this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do understand and appreciate there may be a desire for more detail on where we are at with all this work. Ultimately, these are policy matters and are decisions for the Government of the day. I look forward to talking more with you on this in the months ahead, after the appropriate announcements are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, our approach to this regime will continue to be - educative and constructive, seeking to support firms to successfully navigate in this new area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that there has been significant work across the industry to prepare and get ready for this regime, and our team have clearly seen that. Towards the end of next month, we&rsquo;ll be publishing a monitoring report setting out what we&rsquo;ve seen, both good and bad, to assist the sector. We&rsquo;ll be following this report up with some industry webinars and roundtables, as part of our engagement-led approach to take feedback and discuss the findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Liquidity Risk Management</h3>
<p>The theme of this conference, &lsquo;Adaptability,&rsquo; is perfectly timed for where we are today. From a regulator&rsquo;s perspective, adaptability does not just mean responding to change; it is about anticipating and preparing for it and looking to the horizon to see what is coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a kaitiaki of financial markets, we want to secure the outcome of everyone participating in market, well informed and with confidence. Our goal is to set clear expectations and guide market participants on what they need to do, particularly where there are risks of veering off the path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our updated liquidity risk management guidance, published in April this year, is a case in point.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remember how this guidance came about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2020, following significant market volatility in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we published a good practice guide on liquidity risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry self-assessed against this in August 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those industry responses disclosed some significant gaps between existing liquidity practices and acceptable practice, particularly around the frequency of stress testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, almost half of all the fund managers surveyed did not provide a date for their last liquidity stress test or said they could not remember the date. To be frank, this was simply not good enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is not going to be a regulator that sits back and waits for a significant liquidity failure, with the resulting harm for investors in that fund. You only have to look to the collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund in the UK in 2019 to see what happens there. Sitting back and simply waiting for harm to happen is not the FMA&rsquo;s preferred approach, and I&rsquo;d remind you, it&rsquo;s what the industry has always said it doesn&rsquo;t want its regulator to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having appropriate systems and controls to manage liquidity, enables investment in these types of assets. It means the frameworks and tools are in place to identify and manage the risks as and when they arise. In short, it&rsquo;s about being prepared to protect investors from foreseeable harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking all of this into account, particularly the short comings we observed in 2021, and cognisant of international regulatory standards, we consulted on and then published updated guidance in April. This guidance is deliberately principles-based, and capable of application to all funds, including and particularly those incorporating significant proportions of private assets and other less liquid assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is guidance that needs to be considered at the Board Level, as a matter of strategy and policy. It&rsquo;s not capable of sensibly being sent to legal, risk and compliance without that direction. This is because it is not prescriptive guidance. Purposely it&rsquo;s not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, Guidance should not simply be left to the legal or compliance departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, the audience for any guidance we publish, are the senior strategy leaders within your organisations, so they can take a strategic view of what is needed. We are not looking for tick box compliance to our guidance, indeed, I am not sure, looking at the guidance, that that is possible &ndash; it is designed to guide firms to consider the important issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Green Bonds</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken previously about the views I bring to the table as a child of New Zealand in the 1980s, under an over-controlled economy with unrealistic controls on just about everything. I am not interested in regulation for the sake of it. I am interested in regulation as an intervention to support growth and the long-term prospects for New Zealanders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is focused on regulation that genuinely matters and delivers for New Zealanders. It must meet the 'so what' test, ensuring it fosters beneficial innovation rather than stifling it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our work on green bonds is a notable example of this. The sector has told us that there can be a more efficient route to market for these bonds that reduces compliance costs and offers investors an additional non-financial benefit, further driving the development of this market. When we hear fair arguments like these, we will act. The aim is for this exemption to be in place early next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also continuing to engage with the FinTech community to understand how we can best enable the safe growth of this sector. The FMA has led the Council of Financial Regulators work on FinTech for a number of years now, acting as a gateway for firms. Most regulators overseas have looked at ways to encourage this sector, and we are talking to those regulators to understand what might work, and what doesn&rsquo;t for New Zealand. Domestically, we are meeting with Government and FinTech firms and working with the industry to best understand the hurdles and opportunities so we can get a practical understanding of what can be done here and the part we can play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is important for me to underline is that we understand that the financial landscape is evolving. Technological developments are rapidly reshaping innovation, and competition &ndash; with much potential for us here in New Zealand. It is important that the FMA is clear on the part we can play to support the safe nurturing of this potential.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FinTech</h3>
<p>At the FMA, we are committed to fostering innovation while ensuring that regulatory safeguards remain effective. By actively engaging with the industry and aligning with international standards, we aim to support the responsible adoption of these technologies, ensuring they deliver meaningful benefits to both investors and consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are eager to support solutions that challenge traditional investment models while ensuring fair, transparent and equitable outcomes for all market participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our recent engagement, there&rsquo;s also been a degree of focus on the exemptions we can issue. Lots of ideas have emerged, some of which could have us taking over from Parliament&rsquo;s job &ndash; running a coach and horses through primary legislation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to spend a moment on the box office topic of exemptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA can grant exemptions from compliance provisions to classes of persons or transactions, provided they align with the FMCA&rsquo;s legislation's intent and purpose. We can also grant one-off exemptions in relation to a particular offer if there are reasons the prescribed rules are not applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are rightly legislative safeguards which restrict the scope of exemptions that we can grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA should not and does not grant exemptions to reform the law or implement new policy changes. Exemptions must be targeted and appropriate to fall within the scope of our powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further safeguards include scrutiny at Parliament&rsquo;s regulation review committee and judicial review. So, while exemptions can provide flexibility in certain cases, they are not a mechanism for broad policy reform, and it is important that is widely understood. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We nonetheless welcome market participants to approach us early when considering whether a one-off exemption may apply so we can work through the options.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Economics Research</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we issued our latest piece of FMA research from our talented economics team. Established 18 months ago, the team is now ramping up, having published research on fairness in financial services and AI. After a series of industry roundtables to discuss the findings, the team&rsquo;s focus has now turned to commercial real estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercial real estate has long been a positive asset class due to its ability to provide both steady income and growth potential in a well-diversified portfolio. However, these investments, like all investments, come with risks. Since 2023, many overseas commercial real estate markets have been going through a downturn. In some cases, real estate funds have had to introduce redemption limits or withdrawal suspensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the situation, we held discussions about commercial real estate exposure with KiwiSaver managers and international regulators. We found that New Zealand investment managers are generally doing a good job in identifying and communicating risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have identified a couple of areas where some firms can enhance their risk management practices. Overall, however, there is minimal cause for concern. I encourage all of you to read the report. Like our guidance, this research is designed to help think about the issues &ndash; it is not a recipe for compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to close by coming full circle and touching back on the continuing discussions across Government and industry to support changes to capital markets. The FMA has been here before, contributing half of the funds to deliver the Capital Markets 2029 report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure to engage with people who are passionate and committed to the development of New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets, as I&rsquo;m sure all of us in this room are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is committed to tackling regulation where it is unnecessary, but also steadfast in its commitment to ensure appropriate and effective protections are in place for the mum and dad investors who were so severely burnt during the collapse of the finance companies. Getting this balance right is key, and I am certain we will get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time, and I would welcome any questions you may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Thoughts On The Economy And Policy Rules At The Federal Open Market Committee, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller, At “A 50 Year Retrospective On The Shadow Open Market Committee And Its Role In Monetary Policy,” A Conference Sponsored By The Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, California</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Key words: Shadow Open Market Committee, monetary policy, inflation, labor market, policy rules <br />
Summary: The speaker discusses the economic outlook, the role of policy rules, and three potential scenarios that could affect monetary policy decisions. <div>
<p>Thank you, Athanasios, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of this very worthy celebration.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;In support of the theme of this conference, I do have some thoughts on the Shadow Open Market Committee's contributions to the policy debate, in particular its advocacy for policy rules. But before I get to that, I am going to exercise the keynote speaker's freedom to talk about whatever I want. To that end, I want to take a few minutes to offer my views on the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy. So let me start there, and afterward I will discuss the role that policy rules play in my decision making and in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>In the three weeks or so since the most recent FOMC meeting, data we have received has been uneven, as it sometimes has been over the past year. I continue to judge that the U.S. economy is on a solid footing, with employment near the FOMC's maximum employment objective and inflation in the vicinity of our target, even though the latest inflation data was disappointing.</p>
<p>Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first half of 2024, and I expect it to grow a bit faster in the third quarter. The Blue Chip consensus of private sector forecasters predicts 2.3 percent, while the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model, based on up-to-the moment data, is predicting real growth of 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>Earlier, there were concerns that GDP in the first half of this year was overstating the strength of the economy, since gross domestic income (GDI) was estimated to have grown a mere 1.3 percent in the first half of this year, suggesting a big downward revision to GDP was coming. But revisions received after our most recent FOMC meeting showed the opposite&mdash;GDI growth was revised up substantially to 3.2 percent. This change in turn led to an upward revision in the personal saving rate of about 2 percentage points in the second quarter, leaving it at 5.2 percent in June. This revision suggests that household resources for future consumption are actually in good shape, although data and anecdotal evidence suggests lower-income groups are struggling. These revisions suggest that the economy is much stronger than previously thought, with little indication of a major slowdown in economic activity.</p>
<p>That outlook is supported by consumer spending that has been and continues to be strong. Though the growth in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has moderated since the second half of 2023, it has continued at an average pace of close to 2.5 percent so far this year. Also, my business contacts believe that there is considerable pent-up demand for durable goods, home improvements, and other big-ticket items, demand that built up due to high interest rates for credit cards and home equity loans. Now that rates have started to come down and are expected to come down more, consumers will be eager to make those purchases. For business spending, purchasing managers for manufacturers describe ongoing weakness in that sector, but those for the large majority of businesses outside of manufacturing continue to report a solid expansion of activity.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the labor market. Only a couple months ago, it appeared that the labor market was cooling too quickly. Low numbers for job creation and a jump in the unemployment rate from 4.1 percent in June to 4.3 percent in July raised risks that the labor market was deteriorating. To remind you of how bad the markets viewed the July data, some Fed watchers were calling for an emergency FOMC meeting to discuss a rate cut. While the unemployment rate ticked down in August, job growth was once again well below expectations. Many were arguing that the labor market was on the verge of a serious deterioration and that the Fed was behind the curve even after a 50 basis point cut in the policy rate at the September FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Then we got the September employment report. Job creation in September was unexpectedly strong at 254,000 and the unemployment rate fell back down to 4.1 percent, which is where it was in June. The report also showed big upward revisions to payroll gains for the previous two months. Together, the message was loud and clear: While job creation has moderated and the unemployment rate has risen over the past year, the labor market remains quite healthy.</p>
<p>Along with other new data on the labor market, the evidence is that labor supply and demand have come into balance. The number of job vacancies, a sign of strength in the labor market, has fallen gradually since the beginning of the year. The ratio of vacancies to unemployed is at 1.2, about the level in 2019, which was a pretty strong labor market. To put this number into perspective, recent research has shown that this ratio has been above 1 only three times since 1960.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The quits rate, another sign of labor market strength, has fallen lower than it was in 2019, a decrease which partly reflects that the hiring rate has fallen as labor supply and demand have come into better balance.</p>
<p>In sum, based on payrolls, the unemployment rate and job revisions, there has been a very gradual moderation in labor demand relative to supply, but not a deterioration. The stability of the labor market, as reflected in these two measures as well as the other metrics I mentioned, bolsters my confidence that we can achieve further progress toward the FOMC's inflation goal while supporting a healthy labor market that adds jobs and boosts wages and living standards for workers.</p>
<p>I will be looking for more evidence to support this outlook in the weeks and months to come. But, unfortunately, it won't be easy to interpret the October jobs report to be released just before the next FOMC meeting. This report will most likely show a significant but temporary loss of jobs from the two recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. I expect these factors may reduce employment growth by more than 100,000 this month, and there may be a small effect on the unemployment rate, but I'm not sure it will be that visible. Since the jobs report will come during the usual blackout period for policymakers commenting on the economy, you won't have any of us trying to put this low reading into perspective, though I hope others will.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I expect payroll gains to moderate from their current pace but continue at a solid rate. The unemployment rate may drift a bit higher but is likely to remain quite low in historical terms. While I believe the labor market is on a solid footing, I will continue to watch the full range of data for signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inflation, after showing considerable progress for several months toward the FOMC's 2 percent target, likely moved up in September. The consumer price index grew 0.2 percent over the past month, 2.1 percent over the past three months, 1.6 percent over six months and 2.4 percent in the past year. Oil prices fell over most of the summer but then more recently have surged. Excluding energy and also food prices that likewise tend to be volatile, and just as it did in August, core CPI inflation printed at 0.3 percent in September and 3.3 percent over the past year.</p>
<p>Private-sector forecasts are predicting that PCE inflation, the FOMC's preferred measure, will also move up in September. Core PCE prices are expected to have risen around 0.25 percent last month. While not a welcome development, if the monthly core PCE inflation number comes in around this level, over the last 5 months it is still running very close to 2 percent on an annualized basis. We have made a lot of progress on inflation over the course of the last year and half, but that progress has clearly been uneven&mdash;at times it feels like being on a rollercoaster. Whether or not this month's inflation reading is just noise or if it signals ongoing increases, is yet to be seen. I will be watching the data carefully to see how persistent this recent uptick is.</p>
<p>The FOMC's inflation goal is an average of 2 percent over the longer run and there are some good reasons to think that price increases will be modest going forward. I am hearing reports from firms that their pricing power seems to have waned as consumers have become more sensitive to price changes. There has also been a steady slowing in the growth of labor compensation. It is true that average hourly earnings growth in September ticked up to 4 percent over the past year. And though it might seem like wage increases of 4 percent a year would put upward pressure on inflation that is near 2 percent, that might not be true if one considers productivity, which has grown at an average annual rate of 2.9 percent for the past five quarters. Some of this strength was making up for productivity that shrank due to the pandemic, but the longer it continues&mdash;up 2.5 percent for the second quarter&mdash;the better productivity supports wage growth of 4 percent, or even higher, without driving up inflation. All that said, I will be watching all the data related to inflation closely.</p>
<p>With the labor market in rough balance, employment near its maximum level, and inflation generally running close to our target over the past several months, I want to do what I can as a policymaker to keep the economy on this path. For me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the federal funds rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level. To help answer questions like this, I often look at various monetary policy rules to assess the appropriate setting of policy. Policy rules have long been of serious interest to the Shadow Open Market Committee. So before I turn to my views on the future path of policy, I thought I would talk about monetary policy rules versus discretion and begin with some background about the use of rules at the FOMC.</p>
<p>For a brief overview of the history of the advent of rules at the Board, I have been directed to the second chapter of&nbsp;<em>The Taylor Rule and the Transformation of Monetary Policy</em>&nbsp;written by George Kahn, and I have also consulted the memories of longtime members of the Board staff.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Rules came along in the 1990s as the Fed was moving away from monetary targeting, focusing more on interest-rate policy, and taking its first major steps toward increased transparency. There was immediate interest in Taylor-type rules among Fed staff, and even some contributions of research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;There was a presentation to the FOMC on rules in 1995, and that was the same year that John Taylor's Bay Area colleague, Janet Yellen, was apparently the first policymaker to mention the Taylor rule at an FOMC meeting. While FOMC decisions mimicked a Taylor rule much of the time under Chairman Alan Greenspan, he was famously an advocate of "constructive ambiguity" in communication, and he and other central bankers since have resisted the suggestion that decisions could be handed over to strict rules. Today, of course, a number of rules-based analyses are included in the material submitted to policymakers ahead of every FOMC meeting, and we publish the policy prescriptions of different rules as part of the Board's semi-annual&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>. Rules have become part of the furniture in modern policymaking.</p>
<p>As everyone here knows, but for the benefit of other listeners, Taylor rules relate the level of the policy interest rate to a limited number of other economic variables, most often including the deviation of inflation from a target value and a measure of resource use in the economy relative to some long-run trend.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241014a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;There are numerous forms of the Taylor rule, but they generally fall into two categories.</p>
<p>The first of these, an inertial rule, has the property that the policy rate changes only slowly over time. I tend to think of it as an approach that captures the reaction function of a policymaker in a stable economy where the forces that would tend to change the economy and policy build over time. When change does occur, a gradual response may give policymakers time to assess the true state of the economy and the possible effects of their decision. One example I can use is the steadfastness of policymakers in the latter part of 2023, when inflation fell more rapidly than was widely expected, and again in early 2024, when it briefly escalated. The FOMC did not change course either time, an approach validated by inertial rules.</p>
<p>A non-inertial rule, on the other hand, allows and in fact calls for relatively quick adjustments to policy. The guidance from these rules is more useful when there is a turning point in the economy, and policymakers need to stay ahead of events. One saw these non-inertial rules prescribe a sharper rise in the policy rate above the effective lower bound starting in 2021 as inflation began climbing above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Non-inertial rules are also more useful in the face of major shocks to the economy such as the 2008 financial crisis and the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The great promise of rules is that they provide a simple and reliable guide to policy, but what should one do when different rules recommend different policy actions given the same economic conditions? Right now, inertial rules tell us to move slowly in reducing policy rates toward a neutral stance that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. On the other hand, non-inertial rules tell us to cut the policy rate more aggressively, subject to the caveat that one is certain of the values of all the 'star' variables: U*, Y* and r*. I think the answer is that while rules are valuable in helping analyze policy options, they have limitations. Among these are the limits of the data considered, which is typically narrower than the range of data that policymakers use to make decisions, and also the fact that simple policy rules do not take into account risk management, which is often a critical consideration in policy decisions. So, while policy rules serve as a good check on discretionary policy, there are times when discretion is needed. As a result, I prefer to think of them as "policy rules of thumb".</p>
<p>Turning to my view for the path for policy, let me discuss three scenarios that I have had in mind to manage the risks of upcoming decisions in the medium term.</p>
<p>The first scenario is one where the overall strong economic developments that I have described today continue, with inflation nearing the FOMC's target and the unemployment rate moving up only slightly. This scenario implies to me that we can proceed with moving policy toward a neutral stance at a deliberate pace. This path would be based on the judgment that the risks to both sides of our dual mandate are balanced. In this circumstance, our job is to keep inflation near 2 percent and not slow the economy unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Another scenario, less likely in light of recent data, is that inflation falls materially below 2 percent for some time, and/or the labor market significantly deteriorates. The message here is that demand is falling, the FOMC may suddenly be behind the curve, and that message would argue for moving to neutral more quickly by front-loading cuts to the policy rate.</p>
<p>The third scenario applies if inflation unexpectedly escalates either because of stronger-than-expected consumer demand or wage pressure, or because of some shock to supply that pushes up inflation. As we learned in the recovery from the pandemic recession, when demand was stronger and supply weaker than initially expected, such surprises do occur. In this circumstance, as long as the labor market isn't deteriorating, we can pause rate cuts until progress resumes and uncertainty diminishes.</p>
<p>Most recently, we have seen upward revisions to GDI, an increase in job vacancies, high GDP growth forecasts, a strong jobs report and a hotter than expected CPI report. This data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired. While we do not want to overreact to this data or look through it, I view the totality of the data as saying monetary policy should proceed with more caution on the pace of rate cuts than was needed at the September meeting. I will be watching to see whether data, due out before our next meeting, on inflation, the labor market and economic activity confirms or undercuts my inclination to be more cautious about loosening monetary policy.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the near term, my baseline still calls for reducing the policy rate gradually over the next year. The median rate for FOMC participants at the end of 2025 is 3.4 percent, so most of my colleagues likewise expect to reduce policy over the next year. There is less certainty about the final destination. The median estimated longer-run level of the federal funds rate in the Committee's Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is 2.9 percent, but with quite a wide dispersion, ranging from 2.4 percent to 3.8 percent. While much attention is given to the size of cuts over the next meeting or two, I think the larger message of the SEP is that there is a considerable extent of policy accommodation to remove, and if the economy continues in its current sweet spot, this will happen gradually.</p>
<p>Thank you again, for the opportunity to be part of today's conference, and for allowing me to share some thoughts, relevant to monetary policy rules and my day job back in Washington. The Shadow Committee has elevated the public debate about monetary policy. May you continue to play that role for many years to come.</p>

<div> Observatory, ELITE Day, impact, growth, expansion
<br />
ELITE Day 2024 focuses on purpose-driven companies. ELITE Impact Observatory measures financial and employment impact. ELITE expands in Europe.
<br /><br />Summary: ELITE Day 2024 highlights purpose-driven companies. ELITE Impact Observatory measures financial and employment impact. ELITE expands in Europe. <div>
<ul>
<li>
<h5><span>Today, ELITE hosts the 5<span>th</span>&nbsp;edition of its strategic Think Tank ELITE Day &ldquo;Purpose-driven companies: lead the future with impact&rdquo; with 350+ international C-Level representatives of ELITE network companies, partners and investors</span></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><span>Launch of the first ELITE Impact Observatory, a unique research measuring the impact of ELITE, in terms of financial performance and employment, on the companies belonging to the network</span></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><span>Over 2,300 companies and 200 partners in Europe are part of the ELITE network</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText1">ELITE, the Euronext ecosystem supporting privately-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their sustainable long-term growth, today launches the ELITE Impact Observatory on the occasion of ELITE Day 2024. The analysis measures the impact of ELITE in terms of financial performance and employment for the companies within the network.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The research is based on a sample of 500 ELITE companies, representative of the main sectors in ELITE and selected based on their specific ATECO code. The selected companies have a turnover of between &euro;10 million and &euro;300 million. The ELITE sample was then compared with a benchmark sample of around 1,200 companies. The benchmark sample was defined using a statistical approach based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>built according to financial parameters and ATECO code in line with the ELITE sample;</li>
<li>structured to maintain, in percentage terms, the weight of each geographic area within the ELITE sample;</li>
<li>numerically larger than the ELITE sample.</li>
</ul>
<p class="BodyText1">The analysis, covering the period from 2019 to 2022, observed trends in revenues, EBITDA, and employment. These three variables are significant for assessing company growth in terms of size, margins, and the ability to create jobs, and therefore also impact employment.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In terms of revenues, the ELITE sample recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of +11.8% over the four years analysed, compared to a CAGR of +7.8% for the benchmark sample. Looking at absolute values, from 2019 to 2022, the ELITE sample saw a 52.2% greater average revenue growth than the benchmark sample.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Regarding margins, the ELITE sample recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of EBITDA of +17.1% over the four years, compared to a CAGR of +12.4% for the benchmark sample. In absolute terms, from 2019 to 2022, the ELITE sample recorded 37% higher average EBITDA growth compared to the benchmark sample.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In terms of employment, the ELITE sample recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of +15.5% in the number of employees, compared to +0.8% for the benchmark sample. In absolute terms, from 2019 to 2022, the ELITE sample saw an average employee growth rate of 1,825% higher than that of the benchmark sample.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The analysis results clearly indicate how ELITE's typical managerial, governance, planning and financial tools create a highly positive impact on the already virtuous and forward-thinking companies that are selected to join this ecosystem, which is dedicated to the sustainable growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><span>ELITE Day &ndash; Purpose-driven companies: lead the future with impact</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">The fifth edition of ELITE Day, held today in Milan at Borsa Italiana&rsquo;s premises in Palazzo Mezzanotte, aims to analyse how companies driven by a clear and shared purpose are not only transforming their sectors but also shaping the future by creating a broader, significant and lasting impact.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">The event, supported by the United Nations Global Compact Network Italy (UNGCN Italy), includes debates, interviews, in-depth panels, and opportunities for discussions between entrepreneurs, top managers, investors, and advisors in the ELITE network. It provides a platform to explore the priorities of virtuous companies, drawing inspiration from CEOs and business leaders who align their growth objectives with tangible and lasting impact for customers, employees and all stakeholders.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">ELITE Day reaffirms itself as a strategic Think Tank attracting a European audience of over 350 C-Level representatives from companies, partners, and investors in the network, exposed to renowned speakers and testimonials. These include Eric de Montgolfier, CEO of Invest Europe; Federico Grom, Serial Entrepreneur; Eleonora Briolini, Board Member and Head of Tax at BDO Italy; C&eacute;dric Lowenbach, Development Director at Bpifrance; Tommaso Paoli, CEO of NUO; Jorge Portugal, General Manager of COTEC; Marco Frey, President of United Nations Global Compact Italy; Emanuele Preve, Shareholder CFO &amp; Board Member of Riso Gallo; Marie-Claire Daveu, Chief Sustainability Officer and Institutional Affairs of Kering; Andrea D'Onofrio, Head of Data &amp; AI Western Europe Microsoft; Pasquale Gravina, Leadership &amp; Training Advisor.<br /><br /><a href="https://admin.eventdrive.com/public/events/64520/website/home/0/0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>View the ELITE Day programme</span></a>.</p>
<p class="BodyText1"><span>ELITE&rsquo;s numbers and European expansion:</span></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Since ELITE&rsquo;s launch, more than 2,300 companies have joined the network, with an aggregate turnover of over &euro;189 billion, representing 42 sectors and employing over 660,000 people.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">ELITE is a success story in providing concrete support to many private companies in accelerating their growth: over 260 companies have raised &euro;947 million with ELITE&rsquo;s direct support, leveraging the Basket Bond<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;model; 73 companies have listed, raising &euro;4 billion; 180 companies have issued over 300 corporate bonds raising &euro;3.6 billion; and around 600 companies have invested in inorganic growth through over 1,800 M&amp;A operations.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Since joining Euronext in 2021, ELITE has been closely aligned with the Group&rsquo;s strategy to promote European capital markets and support private companies in financing their long-term growth. Currently, the focus is on expanding ELITE into other Euronext geographies.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In the Netherlands, in 2022, ELITE and Euronext Amsterdam won participation in the "One Single Hub" promoted by RVO, the Dutch government agency for enterprises under the Ministry of Economic Development, and launched a multi-year programme focused on aggregating and enhancing successful initiatives in collaboration with local stakeholders, while introducing a growth programme for successful SMEs.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">In July 2023, ELITE officially launched in Portugal with an initial group of Portuguese companies joining the programme, now consisting of 25 of the country&rsquo;s most promising companies.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Other European expansion initiatives include the Italy-France Accelerator, launched in 2021 and followed by a second edition in 2023, the first joint programme between France and Italy to drive the growth of companies in these two markets. In early October 2024, ELITE welcomed its first group of companies in France, marking a significant milestone in the development of its network.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">More than 100 companies have joined ELITE since the beginning of 2024, including companies in Italy, as well as those set to begin their journey within the pan-European programme on Tuesday 15 October 2024, which covers growing companies from all over Europe, including Italy, France, Portugal and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Marta Testi, CEO of ELITE, commented:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our purpose serves as the compass guiding every decision and action we take. We firmly believe that connecting businesses and capital is essential for creating sustainable, long-term value. Our goal is to support companies in their growth journey, helping them become stronger, more competitive, and resilient in the global landscape. The ELITE Impact Observatory clearly demonstrates how companies in our ecosystem have experienced significant growth in terms of size, margins and their ability to create jobs. These results, along with the pan-European expansion of ELITE through its integration into the Euronext Group, confirm the key role ELITE plays in accelerating companies' access to the capital and expertise needed for growth.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> appointment, Chairman, SFC, Dr Wong, Mr Lui
Summary:<br />
Dr Kelvin Wong Tin-yau appointed as SFC Chairman, succeeding Tim Lui. Lui lauds Wong’s experience. Wong looks forward to upholding market integrity.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) welcomes the appointment by the Chief Executive of Dr Kelvin Wong Tin-yau as the Chairman of the SFC for a term of three years from 20 October 2024 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Dr Wong will succeed Mr Tim Lui who will step down on 19 October 2024 having chaired the SFC for six years (Note 2).</p>
<p>Welcoming Dr Wong&rsquo;s appointment, Mr Lui said: &ldquo;Kelvin has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the development and regulation of capital markets, in particular, being Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council, which the SFC works closely with to uphold the quality and maintain the integrity of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets and its reputation as an international financial centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having previously been a Non-Executive Director of the SFC and Chairman of the then Investor Education Centre, Kelvin is well-versed in the Commission&rsquo;s policy objectives, its strategic priorities and its operation. I am certain the SFC will continue to benefit hugely from his vast experience in furthering the SFC&rsquo;s core mission to uphold the quality and integrity of Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial markets,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his six-year tenure, Mr Lui said his time at the SFC has been challenging, yet memorable. &ldquo;It has been my honour to be part of the SFC&rsquo;s 35-year inspiring journey working with the Board, senior executives and all SFC colleagues to weather through the immense challenges that Hong Kong and its financial markets faced during the last six years, amongst them, the impact brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions amidst the evolving global economic landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collective efforts have enabled the SFC to ride out the difficult times and continued to make headway in many fronts including enhancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s global competitiveness and interconnectivity with the Mainland markets; upholding market integrity and maintaining its resilience; leading market transformation through technology and ESG, as well as mitigating harm to our markets to safeguard the interest of investors,&rdquo; Mr Lui added.</p>
<p>Dr Wong said: &ldquo;I am honoured to be appointed as Chairman of the SFC, a leading global securities regulator. I look forward to working cohesively with the Board, CEO Julia, and the management team, many of whom I closely partnered with in my previous role as a Non-Executive Director. It is a great moment for the SFC that we must embrace the opportunities and challenges to foster a sustainable and vibrant capital market that not only protects investors&rsquo; interest but also promotes economic growth, advances corporate governance and spurs innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, Ms Julia Leung, said: &ldquo;I would like to extend a warm welcome to Kelvin and express my deep gratitude to Tim for his exemplary leadership and invaluable guidance in steering the SFC through the many difficult challenges while continuing our mission in pursuing market integrity, transparency and resilience. We now have a set of&nbsp;very clear strategic priorities which would enable the SFC to continue its firm commitment in safeguarding the integrity of our markets and continuing to foster market development.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of the SFC, I wish Tim all the very best and I look forward to continuing working closely with the Board under the leadership of the new Chairman to carry out our regulatory objectives and further strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as an international financial centre,&rdquo; Ms Leung added.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dr Wong is currently Chairman of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council until 31 December 2024. He was a Non-Executive Director of the SFC from 2012 to 2018 and was also Chairman of the Investor Education Centre (now known as the Investor and Financial Education Council) from 2017 to 2018. &nbsp;</li>

<title>ISO Standardizes GLEIF's Pioneering Digital Organizational Identity Offering With Publication Of vLEI Technical Standard</title>

<div> standard, vLEI, GLEIF, ISO, authentication <br />
Summary: ISO expands LEI standard to include verifiable LEIs for secure, digital verification of legal entities, pioneering decentralized authentication. GLEIF leads standardization effort.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">ISO has expanded the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) technical standard&mdash;ISO 17442&mdash;to describe a standard approach for embedding the LEI in digitally signed, tamper-resistant verifiable credentials, known as verifiable LEIs (vLEIs).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The publication of&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC0wQXSLG7ubyZJwuiqG2yCZRPzkc28sopyzm06B-2FQHCTBYbm_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgopkqlx8cS0FFNxZUe51piZ6n6okyeDMJdkH51q5lbJ1CbKrK-2FN9A2-2FZ3E0Qhk1jsCvnSIougtAdmFq1VzyVxoyhKR1PwyiOsbcgAZA0n50opmJ2o1PecoJvCUfp8zRejnUGhZ2VGDA5-2BPLgtp7RNOBoE0c9-2BIpbImPJGqGOaLyuULUWFLr1piy1-2FAsKv8G3Hyo8-2Blo5OIRQzdLoONJvU6oOTNV777LHkd9gVLMB-2FgR9Z6tnwwdUp-2BCZPARIwGJxaliAs7RRHsrZLjmWo-2FC62wpyRbvn4HxU9NKHRoKJMa1wA-3D-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ISO 17442-3:2024</a>&nbsp;standardizes the vLEI&mdash;a new form of digitized organizational identity pioneered by GLEIF which answers the global need for the decentralized, automated authentication and verification of legal entities across various industries.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The standard describes different types of vLEI credentials developed using the chaining capabilities of Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) credentials. This chaining, combined with the secure capabilities of the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol for the issuance and revocation of credentials and the pre-rotation of cryptographic keys, allows for the provenance of vLEIs to be traced back to GLEIF as the 'root of trust' for the vLEI trust chain, as well as the organization's LEI in the Global LEI System, which is operated by GLEIF under regulatory oversight.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Notably, the standard describes the use of the vLEI to verify the identity of people that represent an organization in either official or functional roles, both inside and outside the boundaries of the organization. This marks an important step forward in establishing the vLEI as a universally trusted method of digitally verifying the authenticity of persons authorized to act on behalf of an organization, which is a key requirement for sensitive business transactions and other official interactions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "This is a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital organizational identity. The inclusion of the vLEI in ISO 17442 solidifies its role as the global benchmark for secure, digital verification of legal entities. As the vLEI gains traction, it promises to revolutionize how businesses authenticate and trust each other, enabling seamless interactions in a way that has never been possible before. The vLEI not only enhances security and trust but also drives efficiency and scalability across platforms and industries."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The proposal for standardizing the vLEI was brought to ISO by GLEIF. The organization also participated in work efforts for the revision through its membership of the technical committee which manages ISO 17442 (ISO/TC 68 SC 8).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Jim Northey, ISO TC 68 Chair and Non-Executive Director, the FIX Trading Community, adds: "ISO TC68 community would like to thank the work of GLEIF in conjunction with ISO TC 68/SC 8 in their innovative approach to provide secure credentials capable of identifying a legal entity and associated role associated with the legal entity&nbsp;which provides a global standard approach for not only managing identity in regulatory reporting but also commerce in general. Having this open globally supported standard for securely identifying counterparties provides a significant improvement in infrastructure that further increases the value of our global legal identifier system."</span></span></span></p>

<div> Partnership, RegTech, Sanctions screening, Swift, Financial institutions
Summary: GSS and Swift extend partnership for sanctions screening, reducing inefficiencies, false positives, and implementation time. Collaboration aims for industry-wide frictionless payments.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Global Screening Services (GSS),</span>&nbsp;a leading RegTech pioneer, today announced an extended partnership with Swift that will enable financial institutions around the world to access its unique end&shy; to-end sanctions screening platform over the same infrastructure that they already trust to move money between more than 200 countries and four billion accounts globally.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The collaboration progresses a strategic relationship the two organisations announced in October 2022, and reflects a commitment by Swift, GSS and the GSS Advisory Board, comprising 35 of the world's leading financial institutions, to reduce inefficiency in the global payments ecosystem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>More than 40 billion cross-border transactions are screened each year for sanctions compliance, often multiple times to meet different regulatory requirements across the jurisdictions through which money flows. Almost 99% of those flagged for further investigation turn out to be false positives, creating extra costs and delays. GSS aims to address this challenge, providing a cloud-based, standardised and centralised screening service to eliminate unnecessary screening repetition, frequency of false positives and time to investigate. Enabling connectivity via Swift's secure and resilient network, and standard API solution, adds to the efficiency and significantly reduces the time for financial institutions to implement the GSS utility.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Tom Scampion, CEO and Co-founder of GSS, said:&nbsp;</b><i>&ldquo;GSS&nbsp;</i>is committed to improving regulatory compliance and delivering an enhanced customer experience, which our agreement with Swift puts us in a perfect place to provide. We're thrilled to be collaborating with a trusted and secure global platform and are looking forward to our customers unlocking the new benefits on offer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Ultimately, our principal focus is to reduce friction and streamline cross-border payments, so working with Swift will help us take this goal to the next level by guaranteeing the protection of end-to-end screened transactions."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Thierry Chilosi, Chief Business Officer at Swift, added: "</b>lndustry-wide collaboration is vital if we're to remove friction from the cross-border payments ecosystem and achieve our collective goals. Working with GSS will enable our community to streamline their sanctions screening processes using their existing Swift connectivity, with GSS' services complementing our own existing capabilities which are helping drive the industry towards an instant and frictionless future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">"Beyond enabling access to GSS via the Swift network, the agreement also encompasses ongoing collaboration on the development of screening standards, enhancing the effectiveness of sanctions compliance testing, and supporting institutional performance benchmarking."</div>

Summary:<br /><br />MAS maintained S$NEER rate, anticipating sustained growth. Global economy resilient but China's domestic spending weak. Tech-related activities boost regional economies. Singapore's Q3 growth stronger than expected, supported by electronics and modern services. MAS expects GDP growth at upper end of 2-3% forecast range for 2024. Core inflation expected to remain contained, monetary policy settings consistent with medium-term price stability. <div>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>In the July 2024 Monetary Policy Statement, MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or the level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has been appreciating gradually in line with the policy band</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mps_chart_2024_10.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The global economy</span><span>&nbsp;has remained broadly resilient.&nbsp;</span><span>Growth has been steady in the US, sustained by domestic demand, but has been weaker in the Euro area. In China, exports were buoyant in the first half of 2024, but domestic spending continued to be subdued amid the housing market downturn.&nbsp;</span><span>Regional economies</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>meanwhile have benefitted from</span><span>&nbsp;the sustained upturn in the global electronics cycle, with investments supported by tech-related activities.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners are expected to stay on a steady expansion path in the quarters ahead. Final demand will be underpinned by further declines in interest rates as inflation moderates worldwide. Recent policy interventions should also help stabilise near-term growth in China.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to M<span>TI&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><em>Advance Estimat</em><span>es, the Singapore economy expanded by 2.1% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in Q3, accelerating from the average of 0.4% in the first half of the year. Growth momentum was stronger than expected, and was largely underpinned by a step-up in manufacturing output, particularly in the electronics industry. Activity also picked up in the modern services cluster.</span></span></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>For the rest of 2024, Singapore&rsquo;s growth should be sustained by the ongoing upswing in the electronics and trade cycles as well as the easing in global financial conditions. For the year as a whole,&nbsp;</span><span>MAS expects GDP growth to come in around the upper end of the 2&ndash;3% forecast range. The negative output gap is projected to close in H2 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next year, the Singapore economy is currently forecast to expand at close to its potential rate. However, there is significant uncertainty around the economic outlook, reflecting continuing risks in the external environment. A sharp escalation in geopolitical and trade conflicts could exert sizeable drags on global and domestic investment and trade. There is also uncertainty around the pace and impact of global macroeconomic policy easing, and with it, the durability of the electronics upturn.</span></p>
<h2>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS Core Inflation</span><span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-14oct24#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;<span>stepped down to 2.6% y-o-y in Jul&ndash;Aug, from 3.0% in Q2, as consumer price increases fell across a broad range of goods and services. Excluding the impact of the GST hikes, core inflation is estimated to have edged below 2.0% in Jul&ndash;Aug.&nbsp;The seasonally adjusted three-month/three-month&nbsp;<span>rate<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2024/mas-monetary-policy-statement-14oct24#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;of core inflation also declined to an annualised rate of 0.9% in August, reflecting a slower pace of price increases in food services, including hawker food, as well as a range of retail and household durable goods.</span></span></p>
<div>
<div id="edn1"></div>
</div>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Core inflation momentum is expected to remain contained in Q4, which would imply a further slowing in its y-o-y rate over the next few months. Core inflation should end the year around 2%, and average between 2.5%</span><span>&ndash;</span><span>3.0% for 2024 as a whole, down from 4.2% in 2023. CPI-All Items inflation fell to 2.3% y-o-y in Jul&ndash;Aug and should come in around 2.5% this year, compared to 4.8% in 2023.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Amid&nbsp;</span><span>moderate underlying cost pressures, MAS Core Inflation is expected to average around the mid-point of the forecast range of 1.5&ndash;2.5% in 2025. Imported costs are forecast to be broadly stable next year, reflecting an anticipated unwinding of oil production cuts and favourable weather conditions for food supply. CPI inflation in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners should also largely be in line with pre-pandemic norms. On the domestic front,&nbsp;</span><span>unit labour costs are projected to rise more gradually, alongside moderating nominal wage growth as well as a recovery in productivity.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation is forecast to average 1.5&ndash;2.5% as well in 2025. Accommodation inflation should slow as leasing demand falls, partly offsetting an anticipated pickup in private transport inflation amid still-firm car purchases.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The risks to Singapore&rsquo;s inflation outlook are more balanced compared to three months ago. If there is stronger-than-anticipated demand for labour due to upsides in GDP growth, it may take longer for unit labour cost growth to moderate and consequently for services price inflation to normalise. An intensification of geopolitical tensions and commodity price shocks could add to imported costs. However, a significant downturn in the global economy would induce an abrupt easing in cost and price pressures, causing domestic inflation to come in materially lower than expected.</span></p>
<h2>MONETARY POLICY</h2>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s growth momentum has picked up and the negative output gap&nbsp;</span><span>is projected to close in H2 2024</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Barring a weakening in global final demand, the economy should continue to expand at a steady pace and keep close to its potential path in 2025.&nbsp;</span><span>MAS Core Inflation has stepped down but is anticipated to decline further to around 2% by the end of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this outlook, MAS assesses that the monetary policy settings are for now still consistent with medium-term price stability.</span></p>
<p><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>MAS will therefore<span><span>&nbsp;maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> ASX, World Investor Week, financial literacy, ASX sharemarket game, investor education
<br />
ASX joined World Investor Week to promote financial literacy. NSW Treasurer and ASX CEO ring the bell in support. ASX sharemarket game winners announced.
<br /><br />Summary: 
ASX supports World Investor Week. NSW Treasurer and ASX CEO promote financial literacy. ASX sharemarket game winners announced. <div>
<p>ASX today joined over 60 other exchanges globally in ringing the bell for financial literacy in support of World Investor Week. This annual event, led by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), aims to promote investor education and protection by empowering investors with the tools and knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSW Treasurer, the Hon Daniel Mookhey MLC joined ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse and schools from across NSW to ring the bell for financial literacy at ASX headquarters in Sydney.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>NSW Treasurer, the Hon Daniel Mookhey said:</b> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to be highlighting the importance of financial literacy at the ASX&rsquo;s ring the bell for financial literacy event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial literacy is essential in empowering people to make informed decisions about their money, investments and futures. By promoting education and awareness, we can help more people navigate the complexities of the financial world with confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NSW Government is committed to supporting initiatives that enhance financial literacy. We believe that everyone, regardless of their background, should have access to the knowledge and tools needed to make sound financial decisions that will benefit them and their families in the long term. I commend ASX for their focus on investor education and congratulate all the winners of the ASX sharemarket game.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>ASX Managing Director and CEO, Helen Lofthouse,</b> said: &ldquo;World Investor Week unites securities regulators and exchanges, and other financial institutions globally to raise awareness on the importance of financial literacy and informed investing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ASX plays an important role in promoting these objectives, and this event aligns with our intent to enhance financial literacy and empower investors to make sound investment decisions for their future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ASX has run its flagship sharemarket game for more than 45 years and we remain committed to this program which promotes investor education in a practical and fun way. Participants are given a hypothetical $50,000 to invest and, based on the returns made, the winners for the 2024 game are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1<sup>st</sup> &ndash; John Redgrave&nbsp; </li>
<li>2<sup>nd</sup> &ndash; Paul Gabrielides </li>
<li>3<sup>rd</sup> &ndash; Stuart Vaughan</li>
</ul>
<p>All three winners shared similar characteristics in terms of patience and temperament; they were able to ride out the volatility, including choosing the right time to sell.</p>
<p>In taking out first place with a portfolio value of slightly more than $67,000, John&rsquo;s advice for other players is to lose your fear of selling. His &lsquo;winning move&rsquo; was to sell and repurchase after a major geopolitical event: &ldquo;I was surprised the stock markets didn&rsquo;t fall straight away so I decided to sell all stocks at a good price. The falls in the next week were extensive and I then rebought after the falling finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the noise and doing your homework was the key takeaway for all three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to congratulate this year&rsquo;s sharemarket game winners and thank everyone that took part,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said. &ldquo;Financial literacy is the foundation of good investing and ASX is committed to providing investors with the knowledge and tools they need to build confidence in their investment decisions and to navigate both opportunities and risks in the marketplace.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>NZX Updates FY2024 Earnings Guidance</title>

<div> raised, guidance, earnings, capital, trading
Summary:
NZX Limited raised FY2024 operating earnings guidance by 10% due to strong capital raisings, increased trading, and ongoing growth in funds under management and administration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>NZX Limited has today updated its full-year operating earnings1 guidance following strong performance across all business lines.  NZX has raised the FY2024 guidance range from $40.0-$44.5 million to $45.0-$49.0 million (normalised to exclude integration and restructuring costs). This represents a move of approximately 10% between the midpoint of the ranges.  The revision is primarily due to stronger-than-expected levels of large capital raisings in September 2024, which have fed into increased trading and clearing activity. In addition, both Smart &ndash; formally known as Smartshares &ndash; and NZX Wealth Technologies, are benefitting from ongoing growth in funds under management and funds under administration respectively.  The guidance is subject to market outcomes, particularly with respect to market capitalisation, total capital listed and raised, secondary market value and derivatives volumes traded, funds under management and administration growth and technology costs.  Additionally, this guidance assumes there is no material decline in the macro-economic environment and/or market conditions, and there are no significant one-off expenses, major accounting adjustments, other unforeseeable circumstances, or future acquisitions or divestments. </span></p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Publishes Research On Commercial Real Estate And The KiwiSaver Industry</title>

<div> KiwiSaver, FMA, commercial real estate, fund managers, risk management
Summary:<br />
- FMA found most KiwiSaver providers manage commercial real estate exposure well.
- Commercial real estate showed signs of stress globally due to COVID-19.
-  FMA research found good risk management practices among New Zealand fund managers.
- Some areas identified for enhancement include liquidity risk management.
- FMA emphasizes the importance of understanding and managing risks properly.<br /> <div>
<p>Research from the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has found most KiwiSaver providers are well placed to manage their exposure to the commercial real estate market but more work can be done to mitigate and communicate the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercial real estate has become an important alternative asset class for fund managers, and was previously seen as a relatively low-risk investment option within a diversified portfolio.   &nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year commercial real estate started to show signs of stress globally &ndash; increased interest rates and changes in usage patterns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially around second-tier office buildings and retail investments, were driving down valuations. By the start of 2024, transaction volumes had decreased, causing some overseas real estate funds to limit or suspend redemptions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, the FMA undertook research to increase our understanding of the exposure of New Zealand KiwiSaver providers to commercial real estate in order to better understand the risks faced by New Zealand investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA engaged with 10 fund managers about their commercial real estate investments, including both default and non-default funds and funds of different sizes. Based on the information that fund managers provided, most have good practices in place to identify and manage the risks across their commercial real estate positions.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Chief Economist, Stuart Johnson, said: &ldquo;What we found in this research was largely reassuring &ndash; most New Zealand fund managers have been taking a pretty conservative approach to this sector &ndash; in many cases they&rsquo;re underweight against their own targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In most cases the risk to New Zealand investors seems to be recognised and reasonably moderate.  Most funds appear to have good practices in place to identify and manage the risks associated with commercial real estate.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The research did, however, find some areas where firms can enhance their risk management practices, said Johnson. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These include an overreliance on the listed nature of commercial real estate assets for managing liquidity risk. We think some managers might have underestimated the level of liquidity risk associated with both their unlisted and listed commercial real estate assets under the current market conditions. We are also concerned about firms assuming a high degree of liquidity simply because an investment is listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commercial real estate has long been a positive asset class due to its ability to provide both steady income and growth potential. Over recent decades, it has become an increasingly important part of a well-diversified portfolio. But these investments, like all investments, come with risks,&rdquo; said Johnson.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are saying here that it&rsquo;s important that fund managers understand and manage these risks properly.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<div> Seminar, Financial Literacy, Technology, Sustainability, Investor Education
Summary:<br /><br />NGX Group and SEC organized events to promote financial literacy, technology, and sustainability. Leaders emphasized investor protection and technology-driven innovation. <div>
<p>As part of the global IOSCO World Investor Week, which took place from October 7-13, 2024, Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), in collaboration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other market operators, organized a series of engaging events aimed at promoting financial literacy and empowering retail investors.

The week&rsquo;s events culminated in the symbolic &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy&rdquo;, leveraging the NGX Closing Gong Ceremony to emphasize the ongoing efforts to educate and empower retail investors. Over 200 participants, including representatives from institutions like the Nigerian Higher Education Foundation, the University of Lagos, and GFA Technologies, attended.</p>

Jude Chiemeka, CEO of NGX, reiterated the importance of investor education, stating, &ldquo;By equipping individuals with the right tools, we&rsquo;re building a more secure and resilient investment ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other notable contributions included remarks from Femi Shobanjo, CEO of NGX RegCo, on the Exchange&rsquo;s self-regulatory mandate, and Adedayo Hamzat, GMD of Zedcrest Group, who advocated for technology-driven portfolio diversification.

The week-long activities, executed in collaboration with partners such as United Capital Securities, Zedcrest Group, the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), and the Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), demonstrated a collective effort to create a more informed, resilient, and empowered retail investor community.</p>

<p>On Friday, October, 18, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen will preside over a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) at the Treasury Department. The meeting will consist only of an executive session. The preliminary agenda for the executive session includes an update on banking and commercial real estate developments; an update on short-term investment vehicles; an update on Federal Housing Finance Agency proposals related to the Federal Home Loan Banks; an update on private credit; and an update on the Council&rsquo;s 2024 annual report.</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Council to convene no less than quarterly, but the Council has historically convened on a more frequent basis. The meetings bring Council members together to discuss and analyze emerging market developments and financial regulatory issues. The Council is committed to conducting its business as openly and transparently as practicable, given the confidential supervisory and sensitive information at the center of its work. Consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/The%20Council%26%23039%3Bs%20Transparency%20Policy_1.pdf">Council's transparency policy</a>, the Council opens its meetings to the public whenever possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/webcasts">Open session Council meetings are made available to the public via live webcast and can also be viewed after they occur</a>. Upcoming Council meeting dates and times are posted following the official notification to Council members of an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes and readouts for past Council meetings are available below. Meeting minutes for the most recent Council meeting are generally approved at the next Council meeting and posted online soon afterwards.</p>
<p><small>* In accordance with the Council&rsquo;s Transparency Policy, which is available at&nbsp;</small><a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><small>www.fsoc.gov</small></a><small>, this meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; inter-agency and intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law; and to conduct administrative business of the Council.&nbsp;</small></p>

<div> Consultation, Pillar 3 data hub, IT solutions, EBA, prudential disclosures
Summary:<br /><br />The EBA is consulting on IT solutions for centralizing prudential disclosures through a Pillar 3 data hub on its website to comply with the new Banking Package. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>The consultation paper defines the IT solutions and processes that large and other institutions shall follow to publish Pillar 3 information centrally in the EBA data hub.</em></li>
<li><em>The proposed IT solutions leverage the EBA&rsquo;s past and ongoing work and infrastructures&nbsp; in the area of disclosures and reporting.</em></li>
<li><em>The Pillar 3 data hub will centralise on the EBA website the Pillar 3 disclosures of all EU institutions, thus allowing users to download data and visualize the Pillar 3 information in a standardised format.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a consultation on the Pillar 3 data hub, which will centralise prudential disclosures by institutions through a single electronic access point on the EBA website. This project is part of the Banking Package laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD6). This consultation runs until 11 November.</span></p>
<p>The draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) present the IT solutions and processes to be followed by large and other institutions when submitting their respective Pillar 3 disclosures. This includes the IT solutions to be used, the data exchange formats to be considered, the technical validations to be performed by the EBA.</p>
<p>The EBA welcomes feedback both from institutions and users of Pillar 3 information.</p>
<p>The current proposals in the consultation paper consider the feedback received from the industry on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">discussion paper</a>&nbsp;published in December 2023. The summary of this feedback and respective EBA analysis is included in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>In parallel, the EBA continues to run a pilot exercise with voluntary institutions to test the process for large and other institutions. Conclusions from the pilot exercise, together with the feedback received during this consultation, will be taken into account when finalising the draft ITS to be submitted to the European Commission for adoption.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation paper can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 11&nbsp;November 2024. All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<p>A public hearing will be organised in the form of a webinar on 21 October from 15:00 to 16:30 CET.&nbsp;Please register for the hearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-its-p3dh">here</a>&nbsp;by 17 October 13:00 CET.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, backgrounds d next steps</h4>
<p>The new Banking Package (CRR3/CRD6), which will implement the latest Basel III reforms in the EU, includes a mandate to the EBA to develop a Pillar 3 data hub. The EBA&rsquo;s plan on how to implement the mandates included in the banking package is explained in the &lsquo;EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework&rsquo;, published in December 2023.</p>
<p>The CRR3 (Articles 434 and 434a) mandates the EBA to publish on its website all the prudential disclosures for all institutions subject to these disclosure requirements, making it readily available in a centralised manner to all the relevant stakeholders through a single electronic access point on its website. To comply with this mandate the EBA is building a data hub putting together all the disclosures required under Part Eight of the CRR.</p>
<p>The CRD6 (Article 106) mandates the EBA to issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010,&nbsp;to specify the requirements set out in paragraph 1 under which Competent Authorities are empowered to require disclosures more frequently than required under CRR3, set deadlines to institutions to submit the information to EBA and require institutions to use specific media and locations for publication, other than the EBA website for centralised disclosures.</p>
<p>The draft ITS for small and non-complex institutions and on the resubmission policy will be consulted separately, at a later stage.</p>

I highlighted the challenges facing community banks, such as competition, cybersecurity, and third-party risk management. Regulatory reforms are needed to ensure tailoring and supervision. <div>
<p>Good afternoon, I'd like to begin by thanking the event organizers, including our staff at the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors for inviting me to share my thoughts with you at the 18th Annual Community Bankers Symposium.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1">1</a>&nbsp;I always enjoy the opportunity to speak to bankers across the country and share perspectives on the issues facing the banking and financial system, especially when it's related to community banks.</p>
<p>Banks are a critical component of the U.S. economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2">2</a>&nbsp;Their work often extends well beyond the provision of credit&mdash; providing services and volunteer and financial support within their community. Among many things, banks offer financial education, sponsorships and funding for community programs and events. Without question, community banks are important and integral to the local economy.</p>
<p>But community banks also face challenges that require proactive risk management, effective and efficient prioritization of compliance resources, and the need to innovate. Today, I would like to briefly highlight some of the issues banks are facing and discuss ways that community banks and regulators can more effectively work together in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges Facing Community Banks</strong><br />As this audience knows well, community banks face a number of challenges. They often rely on third-party service providers to offer products and services to their customers. It may be more difficult for them to hire and retain qualified staff or plan for future leadership with management succession planning. Given limited staffing, they may be overwhelmed by the recent onslaught of new regulations and guidance. And in light of all of this, it may be challenging to prioritize resources in order to appropriately focus on the most important risks facing their businesses. While the headwinds may seem overwhelming, community banks are always resilient in the face of change.</p>
<p>Often, one of the greatest challenges facing a community bank is not about managing any particular risk but rather how to address all of the risks they face&mdash;and how to&nbsp;<em>prioritize&nbsp;</em>the approach to address each of those risks. Regulators have, at times, exacerbated these challenges through policy choices. The risk of mis-prioritization is not limited to community banks. In my mind, this was most recently evident in the events and supervision leading to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Management failed to address growing interest rate risk and funding risks, and supervisors failed to prioritize and escalate these issues. Our goal should be to identify, understand, and learn from these past mistakes, and to avoid repeating them.</p>
<p>Both regulators and banks should be working toward a common goal&mdash;a banking system that supports economic activity throughout the country, in which banks operate in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with consumer laws and regulations. In considering the challenges facing community banks, both regulators and banks have an important role to play.</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong><br />Community banks face competitive pressures from many sources. These pressures may result from local or regional economic conditions, the needs of retail and business customers, and the products and services available in the market. Competitors can take the form of traditional banks, internet banks, and non-banks like fin-techs and mortgage companies. While fin-tech partnerships can be beneficial to both the customer and the bank, if the relationship is not managed according to safe and sound banking principles, serious problems can result. When deposits are accepted through fin-tech relationships but not handled appropriately, deposit insurance can be jeopardized and the ability to access deposited funds may be impacted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3">3</a></p>
<p>Competition can also come from other local competitors like credit unions, large banks with a broader operational footprint, payday lenders, or other nonbank credit sources. As bank customers grow increasingly comfortable and familiar with new mechanisms for doing business, the use of online banking has continued to expand. This has tended to increase the footprint of non-local banks or lenders, enabling them to effectively compete for business outside of their geographic area. Even against this backdrop, research shows that community banks have maintained an important role in many banking markets, including in small- and medium-sized business lending.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4">4</a></p>
<p>The regulatory framework establishes expectations for how community banks can compete, and often creates an unlevel playing field with many of these competitors. This includes whether they are subject to the same regulation as banks that engage in the same activities and how competition is evaluated.</p>
<p>A core concept in financial regulation is to impose the same regulation&mdash;and I suggest we expand this to include the same regulation, guidance, and supervisory expectations&mdash;on entities that are engaged in the same activities. Banks compete against many non-bank providers, including financial technology firms, credit unions, and other non-bank lenders. In some of these head-to-head competitions, community banks face distinct disadvantages that can pose challenges when competing for the same banking opportunities. For example, banks are subject to taxes and additional regulatory requirements (including the Community Reinvestment Act). They are also subject to a broader range of restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements or the "soft" power of supervision. In all of these cases, the disparity in the legal framework can have a distortive effect on competition. In short, where the financial regulatory framework can provide for parity of treatment, it should do so. The regulatory framework should not knowingly distort competition, or effectively impose a regulatory allocation of credit.</p>
<p>The framework also plays an important role in assessing competition among banks. The mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) approval process can have a disproportionate impact on community banks because the "screens" that are used to evaluate the competitive effects of a proposed merger often result in a finding that M&amp;A transactions in rural markets can have an adverse effect on competition and should therefore be disallowed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5">5</a>&nbsp;Even when these transactions are eventually approved, the mechanical approach to analyzing competitive effects&mdash;which is grounded in the effect of proposed transactions on the control of deposits within individual banking markets&mdash;often requires additional review or analysis, and can lead to delays in the regulatory approval process.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br />Community banks often note cybersecurity and third-party risk management as areas that raise significant concerns. Cyber-related events, including ransomware attacks and business email compromises, are costly and time-consuming experiences, and they pose unique challenges for community banks. For example, the maintenance of and the technology resources required to support a successful cybersecurity program are often difficult for smaller banks. Regulators can promote cybersecurity, and stronger cyber-incident "resilience" and response capabilities by identifying resources and opportunities for banks to develop "muscle memory" in cyber incident response.</p>
<p>Recent incidents, like the Crowdstrike-related outage, have highlighted the heavy dependence many banks have on technology, third-party providers, and the broader supply chain. In the current risk environment, it is important for banks of all sizes to implement sound operational resilience, cybersecurity, and third-party risk-management practices. One important resource for community banks is the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) website, which includes the FFIEC Cybersecurity Resource Guide and links to other external cybersecurity resources.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve plays an important role in supervising banks and supporting risk management practices. For example, the Federal Reserve hosts the Midwest Cyber Workshop, with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6">6</a>&nbsp;Over the past two years, this workshop has provided a forum to further cyber risk discussions among community bankers, regulators, law enforcement, and other industry stakeholders. Today's Symposium also includes an interactive cyber workshop, during which participants will participate in a cyber exercise, working through the various decisions that would be required in responding to a hypothetical cyberattack.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7">7</a></p>
<p>We know well that cyber threats pose real risks to the banking system. We also recognize that community banks may have unique needs in preventing, remediating, and responding to cyber threats. Therefore, regulators should ensure that a range of resources are available to support community banks and seek further opportunities to help build community bank resilience against these threats.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Risk Management</strong><br />Third-party risk management can pose an additional challenge for community banks. Due to their size and scale, community banks often leverage centralized resources&mdash;technical experts who have greater expertise than the bank could fully maintain on staff&mdash;to advise and assist on a range of issues. Often these third-party service providers are significantly larger, and their bank clients&mdash;including smaller banks&mdash;may lack leverage in conducting due diligence and negotiating the terms of the relationship.</p>
<p>In 2023, the federal banking agencies published supervisory guidance addressing third-party risk management, which was expressly applicable to community banks. As I noted at the time it was issued, the guidance included shortcomings that were known and identified but not addressed in advance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8">8</a></p>
<p>What many of you may not know is that after nearly a year from the original publication, the regulators published a guide to assist community banks&nbsp;<em>interpret&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>apply&nbsp;</em>the guidance to their third-party risk management activities. The guide was intended to provide additional context for the guidance&mdash;including step-by-step examples of how to address third-party risk management&mdash;making the guidance more useful. While I am pleased that the community bank implementation guide was eventually published, the delays in its publication suggest a shortcoming in our regulatory approach. We must ensure new guidance provides clarity to regulated firms on its own, or that we provide additional resources at the time the guidance is published.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Compliance</strong><br />Like third-party risk management, consumer compliance can be another area that may present challenges to community banks given their size and scale. An effective and well-run consumer compliance program balances consumer protection with the complexity and cost to establish a robust compliance management program. One challenge for community banks is the difficulty in retaining qualified consumer compliance experts. Notwithstanding these challenges, community banks devote significant time and resources to their consumer compliance risk management programs. Compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lending laws, is essential to ensuring that the banking system provides fair and broad access to credit and financial services.</p>
<p>Community banks take these responsibilities seriously, and the overwhelming majority of banks that we supervise invest in strong compliance management systems to prevent violations and detect problems before they occur. When consumer compliance concerns arise, banks address them by making their customers whole and adopting the necessary changes to ensure that issues do not persist or reoccur. In a very small subset of cases, banks fall short of their obligations, and we hold those institutions accountable through enforcement actions or other supervisory actions.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's consumer compliance supervision program is risk-focused and tailored to a bank's compliance risk, focused on the activities that present the greatest risk. One example related to third-party risk management is our recent system supervisory focus on consumer compliance risks associated with fin-tech relationships. As a result of this work, our supervisors seek to identify the parties to relationships that pose the greatest risk of consumer harm. This effort promotes our understanding of higher risk fin-tech partners across the Federal Reserve System, and helps supervisors proactively identify relationships that pose greater risk of consumer harm.</p>
<p><strong>Other Core Risks</strong><br />There are a number of "core" risks that are essential for bank management to address. These "core" risks&mdash;including funding, liquidity and credit risk&mdash;should already be integrated into management priorities, since they pose the greatest threats to a bank's operations.</p>
<p>Focusing on core risks is second nature for community banks. In contrast, supervision can be susceptible to diversion from core to non-core risks leading supervisors to neglect the build-up of traditional risk. Diverting resources to non-core risks can often leave a bank vulnerable, especially when regulators direct banks to allocate resources in other ways, whether by regulation, guidance, or through supervisory expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigating Risks to Community Banks</strong><br />The design of regulation, guidance, and supervisory approach regulators rely upon for community banks&mdash;and the intentional policy choices that underpin this framework&mdash;are important for ensuring their effectiveness in supporting the safety and soundness of the banking system. These design choices can enable community banks to operate successfully while mitigating risks, leveraging tailoring, transparency, and consistency across institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9">9</a>&nbsp;I have spoken at length about these themes in the past, but I would like to reiterate just a few of the critical elements of a regulatory agenda that will allow community banks to thrive in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to revisit size thresholds over time as inflation and economic growth slowly erode our regulatory categories. The bank regulatory framework is built largely upon asset-based size thresholds, and these thresholds should reflect a deliberate policy choice. But, over time, these fixed thresholds effectively result in more firms being "scoped in" to higher compliance tiers over time, even when there has been no change in a bank's underlying risk profile.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10">10</a></li>
<li>We need to have a regulatory system in which M&amp;A transactions and de novo bank formations are possible for banks, not one in which regulatory approval requirements are used to impose additional (and extra-regulatory) requirements on firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20241011a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11">11</a>&nbsp;Viable formation and merger options for banks of all sizes are necessary to avoid creating a "barbell" of the very largest and very smallest banks in the banking system, with the number of community banks continuing to erode over time. Left unchecked, an applications process that imposes additional costs and delays on healthy and appropriate banking transactions will result in a reduction in available credit and services, an increase in the number of unbanked or underbanked communities, and economic harm.</li>
<li>We should prioritize direct experience in our regulatory efforts, giving greater voice and opportunities for input from policymakers with banking or state supervisory experience currently at the Federal banking agencies, and by soliciting and accepting feedback from our state banking counterparts. Greater coordination and participation by a wider set of policymakers in regulatory reform efforts would bring several benefits. For example, discussion of competing ideas and compromise in the drafting of regulatory proposals often results in a more moderate approach, reducing dramatic swings of the regulatory pendulum. And in many instances, we can better anticipate the unintended consequences of reform proposals if policymakers engage in good faith discussions and coordination of these efforts.</li>
<li>While regulatory reform brings many benefits, we should also shift our mindset to focus on the tradeoffs of regulation, guidance, and supervision. Changes to the regulatory framework often yield benefits in terms of greater visibility into the workings of the banking system, additional capital that can absorb losses and promote financial resiliency, and more conservative risk-management standards for interest rate risk and funding risk. But we need to evaluate not only the benefits of proposals but also the costs and unintended consequences. How will banks adjust their activities in response? Will they raise prices on lending activities or for other banking products or services? Will they exit certain low-margin businesses, resulting in greater concentration and increased financial stability risk? By considering the cumulative burden, we can better address and acknowledge these concerns.</li>
<li>And finally, we must incorporate "tailoring"&mdash;calibrating the regulatory framework based on the size and complexity of banks' activities&mdash;as a required input for regulatory consideration. Tailoring helps us to better allocate finite resources both in banks and among regulators and helps us avoid threatening the long-term viability of community banks by simply adding to the mass of existing regulations, guidance, and other supervisory material. We simply cannot ignore the "cumulative" or "compounding" effect of increasing the complexity of the regulatory framework and we must make room in our reform agenda for the unglamorous work of "maintenance" in promoting an efficient framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>By no means is this proposal for regulatory reform exhaustive, but these critical components must be integrated into our future approach to ensure a diverse banking system for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, and for your commitment to community banking. You serve a critical role within the banking system, and in support of the U.S. economy. Your work to leverage the power of the community banking model enables you to serve your customers, promote financial inclusion and expand access to banking services. But policymakers have an important responsibility to make sure that the community banking model remains viable into the future. To function effectively, the banking system requires the presence of banks of all sizes&mdash;larger, regional, and community banks. This diversity of our financial institutions is the greatest strength of our banking system, and it can easily be imperiled by insufficiently targeted regulation, supervision, and guidance.</p>

Summary:<br />
Basel Committee updates G20 on banking turmoil analysis, focusing on liquidity risk dynamics and plans to strengthen supervisory effectiveness. <div>
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee provides update to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on its analytical work of the 2023 banking turmoil.</li>
<li>Report summarises empirical analysis on liquidity risk dynamics observed during the turmoil.</li>
<li>Committee will continue work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness and assess whether specific features of the Basel Framework performed as intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is today publishing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d582.htm"><span class="firstword">progress</span>&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on its analytical work of the 2023 banking turmoil. The report, requested by the G20 Brazilian Presidency, provides an update on the Committee's analytical work on liquidity risk dynamics observed during the turmoil. It builds on the Committee's stocktake report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d555.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="firstword">published</span></a>&nbsp;in October 2023.</p>
<p>The progress report includes updated empirical analysis on the liquidity outflow rates experienced by distressed banks during the turmoil and assesses the materiality of liquidity risk factors that are not explicitly covered by the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The report also analyses the impact of the accounting treatment and valuation of liquid assets eligible to meet the LCR and other potential impediments to banks' ability and willingness to draw down their liquidity buffer. It also assesses the use and role of supervisory monitoring tools and other stress indicators.</p>
<p>Drawing on the findings of this progress report, the Committee is continuing to pursue a series of follow-up initiatives related to the turmoil, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>prioritising work to strengthen supervisory effectiveness and identify issues that could merit additional guidance at a global level; and</li>
<li>pursuing additional follow-up analytical work based on empirical evidence to assess whether specific features of the Basel Framework, such as liquidity risk and interest rate risk in the banking book, performed as intended during the turmoil and assess the need to explore policy options over the medium term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This follow-up work is fully in line with the imperative of implementing the Basel III standards in a full and consistent manner, and as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>Background</em></h4>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>SEC Charges U.S.-Based Moog Inc. With FCPA Violations For Subsidiary’s Role In Indian Bribery Scheme</title>

<div> SEC, Moog Inc., FCPA, India, bribery
Summary:
Moog Inc. agreed to pay a $1.1 million civil penalty for violating the FCPA by bribing Indian officials through its subsidiary. The SEC found Moog violated recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions. Moog consented to cease future violations and pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. <br /><br />Summary: The SEC found Moog Inc. violated the FCPA by bribing Indian officials through its subsidiary Moog Motion Controls and agreed to pay a $1.1 million civil penalty. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Moog Inc., a New York-based global manufacturer of motion controls systems for aerospace, defense, industrial and medical markets, agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.1 million to resolve the SEC&rsquo;s charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of bribes paid by its wholly owned Indian subsidiary, Moog Motion Controls Private Limited (Moog Motion Controls).</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, from 2020 through 2022, Moog Motion Controls employees bribed a variety of Indian officials to win business and also used a variety of schemes to make the improper payments, including by funneling them through third-party agents and distributors. These same Moog Motion Controls employees also offered cash bribes to Indian officials in an attempt to cause public tenders in India to favor Moog&rsquo;s products and exclude competitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s action against Moog highlights the need for issuers operating internationally to have appropriate compliance and internal accounting controls over third parties and third-party payments, as weaknesses in those systems heighten corruption risk,&rdquo; said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that Moog violated the recordkeeping and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Moog consented to the entry of the SEC&rsquo;s order requiring it to cease and desist from committing or causing any future violations and agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling nearly $600,000, and a civil penalty of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Irene Gutierrez, Michelle L. Ramos, Maria F. Boodoo, and Tracy L. Price of the SEC&rsquo;s FCPA Unit.</p>

<title>Corporate And Municipal CUSIP Request Volumes Slow In September</title>

<div> September 2024, CUSIP issuance report, decrease, new identifiers, corporate, municipal<br />
Summary:<br />
September 2024 CUSIP issuance report shows a decrease in new corporate and municipal identifier requests. Overall, there is a positive trend in volume. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y_d034Z-mnePzVSEe1vuUCeXMwe9KN41yjurc9yA0B4uNple1N5Qx78emULMkwYdJKtQi4NTKYWkOnt8q05C8a9EQuZ_FQQPjzBDzVgY83QtHuDoWv6LdLHQrcxAo94R" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a><span>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for September 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a decrease in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers.</span></p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 7,160 in September, which is down 5.8% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 4.3%. The monthly decline in volume was driven by a 7.7% decrease in request volume for U.S. corporate equity identifiers and a 10.0% decrease in request volume for Canadian corporate identifiers. Request volumes for short-term certificates of deposit (-5.4%) and longer-term certificates of deposit (-19.1%) also fell in September.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 10.2% versus August totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 7.2%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 167 new CUSIP requests in September, followed by New York (134) and California (69).</p>
<p>&ldquo;While CUSIP request volume is down across most asset classes, this month, that is largely a reflection of difficult comparisons to last month, where we saw a significant surge in new issuance activity,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;On an annualized basis, we&rsquo;re seeing a positive trend in CUSIP request volume as we turn the corner to the fourth quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 9.5% in September and international debt CUSIP requests rose 13.2%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 2.4% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 100.3%.</p>

<div> Scams, Retirement planning, Investor protection, InvestSmart® Fest, Financial education
Summary:
InvestSmart® Fest 2024 focuses on retirement planning and protecting investors from scams, with rising scam complaints and an Anti-Scam Zone featured. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today kicked off its annual investor education event InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> Fest 2024, focusing on retirement planning and safeguarding investors from scams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent SC study<sup>1</sup> found that 54% of respondents believe their savings are insufficient for retirement with only 16% confident their funds will last over 20 years after retirement. Alarmingly, 18% of respondents feel their saving can only be sustained for five years or less.</p>
<p>Investor protection also remains a pressing issue, with 3,380 scam related complaints and enquiries received by the SC as of the third quarter of this year. This trend has been on the rise, with a 28%<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; increase last year, proving the evolving sophistication of fraudulent schemes despite regulatory interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As such, InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup> Fest 2024 highlights SC&rsquo;s efforts in increasing awareness and knowledge on the benefits of safe investing as well as saving earlier in life.</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi stressed that staying vigilant in an increasingly digital world is no longer a priority for investors, but a necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The SC remains committed to safeguarding investors, but vigilance is key. Through InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest, we are equipping Malaysians with the tools to recognise threats and make secure financial decisions,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SC Executive Director and General Counsel Yew Yee Tee warned of rising digital scams involving deepfakes, fraudulent pre-IPO schemes and the mislabeling of Shariah compliant products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public must practice caution and ensure they deal with licensed individuals or companies before making any investment decisions," she said in her opening speech at the event.</p>
<p>In response to the growing influence of financial influencers (finfluencers) on social media, the SC has updated the Guidance Note on the Provision of Investment Advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC also cautioned against mule account scams, where victims are persuaded to rent out their bank accounts, leading to serious consequences.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Bursa Malaysia, InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest 2024 will also participate in the &lsquo;Ring the Bell for World Investor Week&rsquo; campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This global initiative organised by the World Federation of Exchanges and spearheaded by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, brings together stock exchanges worldwide to promote investor education and protection.</p>
<p>InvestSmart<sup>&reg; </sup>Fest 2024, expected to draw over 11,000 visitors to Mid Valley Exhibition Centre (MVEC), will feature 40+ exhibitors and 600 free financial planning sessions under <b>#FinPlan4u</b>. For the first time, an <b>&lsquo;Anti-Scam Zone&rsquo;</b><sup>3</sup> will educate the public on scam prevention.</p>
<p>The event is supported by Bursa Malaysia, the Federation of Investment Managers Malaysia, Financial Planning Association of Malaysia and Malaysian Financial Planning Council.</p>

<div> regulator, supervisor, administrative sanctions, financial sectors, convergence 
Summary:<br />The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published its report on administrative sanctions imposed by National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in EU Member States in 2023. The report highlights the large number and value of administrative fines across EU Member States in the financial sector, with a focus on the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). The report also emphasizes the need for more convergence between NCAs in the exercise of their sanctioning powers. ESMA aims to foster consistent implementation of capital markets rules and ensure similar breaches lead to similar enforcement outcomes across the EU. The underlying data is available for download, and a snapshot of the key findings is published. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1333_Annual_Sanctions_Report.pdf">first consolidated report on sanctions and measures</a>&nbsp;imposed by the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in Member States in 2023.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>In 2023, more than 970 administrative sanctions and measures were imposed across EU Member States in financial sectors under ESMA&rsquo;s remit. The aggregated value of administrative fines amounted to more than 71 million EUR. The highest amounts of administrative fines were imposed under the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Overall, the report highlights that there is still room for more convergence between NCAs in the exercise of their sanctioning powers.</p>
<p>The use of sanctions is only one of multiple tools in the NCA&rsquo;s supervisory toolkit, and supervisory effectiveness cannot be measured solely based on the number or value of the sanctions imposed in a Member State. The consolidated report does not provide a full picture of national enforcement activities; for example, these may also include more informal actions, and not all criminal sanctions are included in the scope of the report.</p>
<p>The data on the use of sanctions included in this report was reported to ESMA by the NCAs. In line with the ESMA Strategy 2023-2028, the consolidated report contributes to supervisory and enforcement convergence and facilitates greater transparency on sanctions.</p>
<h4><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p>Building on this report, ESMA will further foster the effective and consistent implementation of capital markets rules and ensure similar breaches lead to similar enforcement outcomes across the EU.</p>
<p>The underlying data is available in excel format and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1508_Consolidated_Sanctions_Report_-_Table_of_Sanctions.xlsx">here</a>. In addition, a snapshot of the report&rsquo;s key findings is published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-10/ESMA43-1527801302-1551_Enforcement_Snapshot.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<div> Global Business Optimism Insights Report, Q4 2024, Dun & Bradstreet, business optimism, inflation, monetary policies<br />
Summary:<br />
Business optimism increased by 7%, driven by easing inflation and favorable borrowing conditions. U.S., U.K., and Spain saw notable recoveries. Supply chain and financial confidence also improved. ESG initiatives increased. <div>
<p>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), a leading global provider of business decisioning data and analytics, today released its Q4 2024 Global Business Optimism Insights report. The report, fielded in Q3 2024, found a 7% increase in business optimism quarter-over-quarter, driven by gradual easing of inflation rates and favorable borrowing conditions.</p>
<p>Nearly four in five businesses are expressing increased optimism in domestic and export orders, capital expenditures and financial risk due to a combination of easing financial pressures, shifts in monetary policies, robust regulatory frameworks and higher participation in sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>U.S. businesses recorded a nearly 9% rise in optimism, aided by falling inflation and expectations of further rate cuts. Similarly, business optimism in the U.K. and Spain showed notable recoveries as their respective central banks initiated monetary easing, rising by 13% and 9%, respectively. Emerging economies, such as Argentina and India, saw jumps in optimism levels due to declining inflation and increased domestic demand respectively.</p>
<p>"While overall global business optimism has increased and inflation has abated, it's important to recognise that geopolitics contribute to economic uncertainty," said Neeraj Sahai, President of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International. "Industry-specific regulatory risks and more stringent data requirements have emerged as the top concerns among a third of respondents. To mitigate these risks, businesses are considering diversifying their supply chains and markets to manage regulatory risk." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key findings from the Q4 report's five indices include:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The Global Business Optimism Index</b>&nbsp;increased by 7.3% over Q3 2024. This is a significant increase with 75% of businesses, especially smaller businesses, expressing confidence in sales and domestic and export orders ahead of the holiday season. The real estate (12.5%) and utilities (10.4%) sectors saw the highest jumps in optimism levels.</li>
<li><b>The Global Supply Chain Continuity Index</b>&nbsp;improved 6.8%, stemming from businesses reducing burdens on their supply chains by adopting nearshoring, using alternative and less-congestive routes, and relying on domestic supplies. One in four businesses in the U.S., as well as Switzerland and Spain, are considering diversifying supply chains and markets as their preferred strategy to manage their regulatory risk.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business Financial Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;increased 6.3% due to expectations of improved financial conditions and reduced borrowing costs as many economies have started to cut interest rates. Confidence in the U.S. and South Korea notably improved by 5.2% and 11.2%, respectively, on indications of their central banks pivoting towards looser monetary policies.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business Investment Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;improved 3.6%, showcasing optimism in capital spending centered around signs of global monetary policies becoming more accommodative, along with improvement in macroeconomic activities.</li>
<li><b>The Global Business ESG Index</b>&nbsp;increased by 6.1%, stemming from businesses' efforts to meet regulatory requirements, stricter disclosure mandates and heightened investor awareness. Globally, stricter environmental regulations, such as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, are among top concerns for 29% of businesses, resulting in almost one in four conducting risk assessments or implementing regulatory compliance strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Descriptions and information about the indices can be found on page 24 of the report.</p>
<p>"Businesses are increasingly confident as borrowing costs decline, boosting optimism for higher sales, stronger exports, and reduced financial risks," said Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. "This confidence is driving capital investments, with easing supply chain pressures supporting growth in the year's final quarter."</p>
<p><b>About the Global Business Optimism Insights Report</b></p>
<p>The Global Business Optimism Insights report is a synthesis of data from a comprehensive survey encompassing 32 economies, covering approximately 10,000 businesses and 17 sectors, alongside insights from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, leveraging the firm's proprietary data and economic expertise. The report is an amalgamation of five indices which reflect overall business optimism and expectations about supply chain continuity, financial and investment conditions and ESG initiatives. An index reading above 100 indicates an improvement in optimism relative to the base year (Q3 2023 to Q2 2024), while an index reading below 100 signifies a deterioration in optimism.</p>

<div> awards, BMLL, data science, hedge funds, market data
Summary:
BMLL won "Best Data Science Solution Provider" at HedgeWeek US Awards 2024, recognized for providing high-quality historical market data and analytics. Their platform supports start-up and large hedge funds. Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, highlighted the challenges that hedge funds face in obtaining high-quality historical market data and how BMLL addresses this issue by providing high-quality, Level 3, 2, and 1 historical order book data. BMLL’s platform not only simplifies access to deep market insights but also scales with the growing data needs of users. <div>
<p><span>We are delighted to announce that BMLL has won &ldquo;Best Data Science Solution Provider&rdquo; at the HedgeWeek US Awards 2024. These awards recognise excellence among fund managers and service providers in the US across a wide range of categories.</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL was awarded for providing harmonised, Level 3, Level 2 and Level 1 historical data and analytics to hedge funds, helping them improve predictability, quality and speed of alpha through a scalable, managed data and analytics service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The award recognises BMLL&rsquo;s support for start-up hedge funds such as Aleto, who leverage BMLL&rsquo;s data science platform to reduce set-up costs and shorten time to market, as well as BMLL&rsquo;s capabilities for supporting large systematic hedge funds with alpha generation and operational needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Specifically, BMLL helps quant teams deliver predictive alphas: using BMLL&rsquo;s suite of predictive analytics and scalable research, they can unlock patterns in market behaviour, improve signal generation and optimise algorithm performance at a fraction of the cost of building the capabilities in-house.</span></p>
<p><span>BMLL&rsquo;s ready-to-use, quant-built data science platform, provides hedge funds with the necessary research infrastructure to support their specific operation and growth from the outset, without the high upfront costs and lengthy timelines normally associated with launching a quantitative or systematic fund.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Paul Humphrey, CEO of BMLL, said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are thrilled to be named Best Data Science Solution Provider at the Hedgeweek US Awards 2024. Hedge funds face significant challenges in obtaining high-quality historical market data, as incumbent real-time data providers often only supply commoditised historical data that lacks the granularity and accuracy needed for effective quantitative strategy development. These data gaps can negatively impact strategy performance and lead to excessive resource allocation for data cleansing and normalisation.</span></p>
<p><span>At BMLL, we address this issue by providing hedge funds with high-quality, Level 3, 2, and 1 historical order book data that captures and displays the trading intentions of all market participants. This enables our clients to access clean, reliable data without the need for extensive in-house infrastructure, allowing them to focus on research and development. Our platform not only simplifies access to deep market insights but also scales with the growing data needs of our users, helping them optimise their strategies and stay competitive in a fast-evolving market.&rdquo;</span></p>

ASIC cancelled two AFS licences and 11 credit licences for failing to maintain AFCA membership, late compliance, and other breaches.
<br /><br />Summary: ASIC cancelled AFS and credit licences for non-compliance, late compliance, and other breaches, including failure to maintain AFCA membership. <div>
<p>ASIC has cancelled two Australian financial services licences (AFS licence) and 11 Australian credit licences (collectively, the Licensees).</p>
<p>The Licensees were required by law to be a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). AFCA membership gives consumers access to a free, fair, and independent dispute resolution scheme if a complaint cannot be resolved internally by a Licensee.</p>
<p>ASIC works with AFCA to identify AFS licence and credit licence holders that do not comply with their obligation to maintain their AFCA membership.</p>
<p>If an entity is expelled from the scheme or requests to withdraw membership, AFCA must notify ASIC. Where an entity fails to comply, or is otherwise in breach of general conduct obligations, ASIC will continue to take action to cancel AFS licence or credit licences.</p>
<p>The Licensees have, varyingly:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>failed to be a member of AFCA</li>
<li>failed to lodge annual compliance certificates on time (credit licence holders)&nbsp;</li>
<li>failed to prepare and lodge an annual profit and loss statement and balance sheet (AFS licence holders)</li>
<li>failed to comply with a condition on the licence</li>
<li>failed to pay industry funding levies owed to ASIC</li>
<li>ceased to carry on a financial services business (AFS licence holders), and/or</li>
<li>ceased to engage in credit activities (credit licence holders).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the period 4 July 2024 and 10 July 2024, ASIC cancelled the AFS licences of:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under section 915C of the Corporations Act, ASIC has the power to cancel an AFS licence if an AFS licence holder has not complied with its obligations under section 912A of the Corporations Act. This includes the obligation to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>be a member of AFCA</li>
<li>to comply with conditions on the licence, for example, the condition to require the AFS licence holder to lodge an opinion by a registered auditor on the AFS licence holder&rsquo;s compliance with the financial requirements, and</li>
<li>to comply with the financial services laws, including section 989B of the Corporations Act to prepare and lodge an annual profit and loss statement and balance sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under section 55 of the Credit Act, ASIC has the power to cancel a credit licence if a credit licence holder has contravened its general conduct obligations under section 47. This includes the obligation to be a member of AFCA and the obligation to comply with the credit legislation. Section 53(1) of the Credit Act outlines the obligation to lodge an ACC and is defined as credit legislation in section 5 of the Credit Act.</p>
<p>Under section 54(1)(d) of the Credit Act, ASIC may cancel a credit licence if the levies and late payment penalties relating to those levies have not been paid in full within 12 months after the due date for payment.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Licensing, Registration, ASIC, Financial services, Professional<br />
Summary:<br />
ASIC provides an update on licensing and professional registration activities. It received 1,531 applications and granted 280 new AFS licences. It aims to improve its licensing processes using a new digital portal. <div>
<p>ASIC has provided an update on its licensing and professional registration activities to assist current and prospective Australian financial services (AFS), and credit licensees understand the licensing regime.</p>
<p>Report 797&nbsp;<em>Licensing and professional registration activities: 2024 update&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-797-licensing-and-professional-registration-activities-2024-update/" title="REP 797 Licensing and professional registration activities: 2024 update">REP 797</a>) provides the latest information on registration and licence applications from the 2023-24 financial year and key changes to licensing processes.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, &lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s licensing and professional registration function plays a key gatekeeping role by ensuring new licensees and registered professionals meet the necessary thresholds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The report provides guidance to AFS and credit licensees and financial services industry professionals about ASIC&rsquo;s rigorous licensing and professional registration decision-making processes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s licensing report also discusses current and emerging licensing issues including in relation to digital (crypto) assets, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services, and payments systems.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Consults On Improving Retail Investor Access To Long-Term Asset Investments</title>

<div> Framework Proposal, Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund, Retail Investors, Investment Fund, Illiquid Assets
Summary:<br /><br />The Ontario Securities Commission proposed the Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund to allow retail investors access to illiquid assets through a new investment fund structure. The aim is to provide opportunities for diversification and potential higher returns while protecting investors and fostering capital formation. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/8/81-737/osc-consultation-paper-81-737-opportunity-improve-retail-investor-access-long-term-assets-through">published a consultation paper</a>&nbsp;aimed at improving retail investor access to illiquid investments through a framework proposal for a long-term asset investment fund product structure.</p>
<p>The consultation proposes the creation of a new investment fund category, the Ontario Long-Term Asset Fund (OLTF), which would allow Ontarians to invest in assets they may not traditionally have exposure to. These assets include venture capital, private debt and equity, and infrastructure and natural resource projects. OLTFs could offer opportunities for more retail investors to participate in capital-intensive projects, while enabling businesses to lower funding costs and raise the capital necessary for growth.</p>
<p>Investors would have an opportunity to diversify their portfolio across assets, but also across different types of businesses or projects. There are existing investment vehicles that would allow access to these assets, but many are privately funded and unavailable to retail investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long-term assets provide a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and potentially achieve higher returns over an extended period,&rdquo; said Raymond Chan, Senior Vice President, Investment Management. &ldquo;Through this consultation, we hope to identify how to broaden investor access to these benefits while also mitigating the risks inherent in illiquid assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-term assets are illiquid assets that cannot be readily disposed of, may be difficult to value, and generally have longer investment time horizons than other assets. An investment fund would provide retail investors with an investment vehicle whose regulatory framework is more specifically tailored to their needs.</p>
<p>The proposed new framework would allow retail investors to gain exposure to these long-term assets through the professional management of a registered investment fund manager and registered portfolio manager. Distribution through a prospectus-qualified investment fund product would mean that suitability, &ldquo;know-your-client&rdquo; (KYC) and &ldquo;know-your-product" (KYP) requirements would generally apply. The consultation also seeks feedback on investor access to OLTFs through order-execution-only, or &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; dealers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The long-term asset fund proposal aims to create a framework that protects investors while fostering innovation and capital formation,&rdquo; continued Chan.</p>
<p>The feedback received will guide the next phase of the proposal, which is anticipated to be the publication for comment of proposed rule amendments and policy changes.</p>
<p>Please submit comments in writing on or before February 7, 2025.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>Office Hours With SEC Chair Gary Gensler: Fraud And Deception In Artificial Intelligence</title>

<div> fraud, manipulation, securities law, artificial intelligence, investor protection
Summary: Under securities law, AI can be used for fraud and manipulation. Deployers must ensure guardrails to prevent harm and be held accountable. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/Tym3pO261Gc">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-transcript-fraud-deception-artificial-intelligence-101024#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>



</p>
<p>In 1950, the famous mathematician Alan Turing asked, &ldquo;Can machines think?&rdquo; What does that mean for securities law, particularly the laws related to fraud and manipulation?</p>
<p>Bad actors, ever since antiquity, have found new ways to deceive the public. With artificial intelligence, fraudsters have yet a new tool to exploit. But make no mistake. Under the securities law, fraud is fraud.</p>
<p>Former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein recently wrote about what happens when you combine AI, finance and the law of fraud. She spoke of three types of harm.</p>
<p>The first: Programmable Harm. It's kind of straightforward. If someone uses an algorithm and is optimizing to manipulate or defraud the public, that's just fraud.</p>
<p>Gets interesting when we get to the second category: Predictable Harm. Again, I think it's reasonably straightforward. In essence, has someone recklessly or knowingly disregarded a foreseeable risk in deploying a particular AI model? In essence, did they act reasonably?</p>
<p>You see, under the securities law, you aren't supposed to trade in front of your customers. That's called front running. You aren't supposed to spoof. In other words, place a fake order. You aren't supposed to lie to the public. Well, it's equally important that the robots, I mean AI models, don't do these things either. Investor protection requires that the humans who deploy the model put in place appropriate guardrails.</p>
<p>Some might ask, what if the AI models themselves are self-learning? They're changing. They're adapting. What if the AI models hallucinate, which we all know sometimes they do. I still believe that those who deploy the AI models should have appropriate guardrails for that as well.</p>
<p>That brings up the third category. In essence, when firms might deploy an AI model that create Unpredictable Harm. How do we hold those firms responsible? While some of that might play out in court, I think right now the harms are mostly either programmable or predictable, because we do know that these models may self-learn, may hallucinate. We do know that there are things that you're not supposed to do, like lie to the public.</p>
<p>You know, there was a famous early movie executive, Joseph Kennedy. He also went on to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And his son became president. Well, what did Chair Kennedy say in this seat 90 years ago? He said, &ldquo;The Commission will make war without quarter on any who sell securities by fraud or misrepresentation.&rdquo; And I think he meant the AI model deployers as well.</p>

Private equity investments offer high returns in exchange for taking a certain level of risk. Manufacturing and natural resources have different volatility and Value at Risk (VaR). privateMetrics uses asset-level private equity indices. Proper private asset risk measurement requires different data that genuinely takes account of the evolution in the risk premia to which the investments are exposed. Indices and benchmarks reflect the level of market prices and the risk of each segment over time.
<br /><br />Summary: Private equity investments offer high returns but come with a certain level of risk. Manufacturing and natural resources have different volatility and Value at Risk. Asset-level private equity indices are used for proper risk measurement. <div>
<p><span>Private equity investments offer high returns in exchange for taking a certain level of risk. These risks result first and foremost in considerable return dispersion and sometimes, despite the long-term investment horizon, in exits in less favourable conditions than anticipated by investors. Private companies can also go bankrupt, but they are more likely to do so in certain segments of the private market. Stratifying the PE universe using the PECCS taxonomy, a range of risk/return profiles appears that suggest a wide range of risk-taking and return-seeking strategies (figure 1).</span><br /><br /><i>Figure 1: Dispersion of 10-year Volatility and Value at Risk (confidence interval 97.5%) of PECCS Activities in Europe</i></p>

<p><br /><span>Proper private asset risk measurement requires different data that genuinely takes account of the evolution in the risk premia to which the investments are exposed, and doing this requires indices and benchmarks that reflect these risks. privateMetrics market indices and benchmarks are asset-level private equity indices that reflect the dynamics of private markets with a beta of 1. They are built by repricing thousands of private companies each month using the latest private market transactions to calibrate an asset pricing model. This approach achieves a high degree of pricing precision at the market segment level, ensuring that indices and benchmarks built with this data accurately reflect the level of market prices and of the risk of each segment over time.</span><br /><br /><span>To find out more:</span></p>

<title>FinCEN Assesses Record $1.3 Billion Penalty Against TD Bank</title>

<div> settlement, TD Bank, violations, AML program, FinCEN
Summary:
The largest penalty of $1.3 billion was imposed on TD Bank by FinCEN for BSA violations and AML program failures. Independent monitorship and remediation required. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) assessed a record&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2024-10-10/FinCEN-TD-Bank-Consent-Order-508FINAL.pdf">$1.3 billion penalty</a>&nbsp;against TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (collectively, TD Bank, or the Bank) for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the primary U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) law that safeguards the financial system from illicit use. TD Bank is among the largest banks in the United States.</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s $1.3 billion settlement is the largest penalty against a depository institution in U.S. Treasury and FinCEN history. FinCEN&rsquo;s action also imposes a four-year independent monitorship to oversee TD Bank&rsquo;s required remediation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of financial institutions have partnered with FinCEN to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system. TD Bank did the opposite. From fentanyl and narcotics trafficking, to terrorist financing and human trafficking, TD Bank&rsquo;s chronic failures provided fertile ground for a host of illicit activity to penetrate our financial system,&rdquo; said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. &ldquo;Our historic action represents a significant step in safeguarding our country and communities from criminal activity like fentanyl and human trafficking by requiring TD Bank to fix the vast deficiencies in its safeguards against money laundering. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to taking action to keep our communities safe from the sort of behavior facilitated by illicit finance and enabled by TD Bank&rsquo;s lax oversight, and we are making clear that financial institutions will face severe repercussions if they fail to maintain necessary safeguards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For over a decade, TD Bank allowed its AML program to languish, making TD Bank a target for illicit actors&mdash;including its own employees,&rdquo; said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki. &ldquo;The magnitude of FinCEN&rsquo;s action is consistent with the harm that TD Bank&rsquo;s failures caused. This historic action should serve as a powerful reminder that we will not tolerate financial institutions who flagrantly violate their obligation to safeguard our financial system from criminal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, TD Bank admits that it willfully failed to implement and maintain an AML program that met the minimum requirements of the BSA and FinCEN&rsquo;s implementing regulations. FinCEN&rsquo;s investigation revealed that TD Bank knew that its AML program was neither appropriately designed nor adequately resourced to mitigate the actual illicit finance risks that it faced on multiple fronts. Among other failures, TD Bank&rsquo;s processing of peer-to-peer transactions (e.g., Venmo and Zelle), including transactions indicative of human trafficking, was insufficient, and as a result, TD Bank failed to identify and timely report these transactions to FinCEN. TD Bank also allowed significant backlogs of potentially suspicious activity to persist, thereby depriving law enforcement of necessary information. TD Bank knew that it was the subject of significant funnel account activity involving high-risk countries yet failed to take timely action to address this substantial risk.</p>
<p>TD Bank also failed to timely detect suspicious activity involving its own employees. For example, in 2021, a TD Bank employee facilitated the laundering of narcotics proceeds in exchange for bribes. This employee opened numerous accounts, including for shell companies, that then engaged in millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of funnel account activity in a high-risk jurisdiction where TD Bank maintained no operations. TD Bank knew that this type of activity was not subject to appropriate controls and failed to mitigate this glaring risk.</p>
<p>As a result of these failures, TD Bank allowed trillions of dollars in transactions annually to go unmonitored for potentially suspicious activity that would require reporting to FinCEN. Specifically, during the time period covered by the Consent Order, TD Bank willfully failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) on thousands of suspicious transactions&mdash;totaling approximately $1.5 billion. Additionally, TD Bank&rsquo;s Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) of large cash transactions were often delayed, and, in some instances, misleading to law enforcement.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to properly limit or report suspicious transactions and cash activity that included substantial criminal activity, as further detailed in the Consent Order. For example, from 2017 to 2021, TD Bank facilitated over $400 million in transactions for Da Ying Sze (Sze), who pled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/queens-man-admits-orchestrating-653-million-money-laundering-conspiracy-operating" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guilty to money laundering</a>&nbsp;in 2022 for his role in conspiring to hide proceeds of narcotics trafficking. Sze conducted most of these transactions in large sums of cash (often in bags that Sze brought into TD Bank branches), yet the Bank failed to timely limit or restrict Sze&rsquo;s activity. TD Bank failed to timely file SARs on a substantial portion of this activity and also failed to identify Sze in more than 500 CTRs totaling more than $400 million, which hindered FinCEN and law enforcement.</p>
<p>TD Bank has agreed to engage an independent consultant, who, under the auspices of FinCEN&rsquo;s monitor, would conduct a historical analysis of TD Bank&rsquo;s transaction data, often referred to as a &ldquo;SAR lookback,&rdquo; to remediate the SAR filings that TD Bank missed due to its extensive control gaps. TD Bank has also agreed that the monitor will oversee an independent, end-to-end review of its AML Program. For the first time, FinCEN is imposing accountability and data governance reviews. The accountability review will independently assess the involvement or failure to escalate by TD Bank personnel in conjunction with certain conduct described in the Consent Order&rsquo;s Statement of Facts. The accountability review will provide corresponding recommendations to the Bank, including recommendations related to the culture of compliance at TD Bank. The data governance review will help to ensure that TD Bank identifies and fixes the root causes of many gaps in its AML program.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will also announce settlements in parallel investigations today.</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s Enforcement and Compliance Division is responsible for investigating serious violations of the BSA. For additional information regarding the facts and circumstances associated with this enforcement action, including the specific BSA violations and their underlying causes, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement_action/2024-10-10/FinCEN-TD-Bank-Consent-Order-508FINAL.pdf">Consent Order</a>&nbsp;between FinCEN and TD Bank.</p>

<div> Treasury Department, sanctions, AML laws, TD Bank, FinCEN<br />
Summary:<br />
Treasury Department penalizes TD Bank $1.3 billion for AML failures enabling drug trafficking, requiring remedial measures and a four-year monitor. Collaboration across agencies emphasized. <div>
<p>Thank you. I am glad to join Attorney General Garland, Deputy Attorney General Monaco, and the rest of you here today. I applaud DOJ&rsquo;s efforts. I won&rsquo;t speak to its case, but to the separate investigation that Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network undertook and the action we&rsquo;ve taken.</p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury utilizes sanctions and the enforcement of our country&rsquo;s anti-money laundering (AML) laws to protect our national security from illicit actors. From drug trafficking to combatting Russian aggression, the Treasury Department is committed to using all of the tools available to us to protect the American people.</p>
<p>We are proud of the public-private partnership we have formed with the financial sector to protect our national security. The vast majority of financial institutions work hand-in-hand with Treasury to keep our country and our communities safe.</p>
<p>TD Bank has done the exact opposite. For more than a decade, through deliberate actions&mdash;and inaction&mdash;TD Bank failed to meet its responsibilities.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to implement or maintain a sufficient AML compliance program.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to monitor trillions of dollars in transactions each year, including those the Bank knew posed a high-risk for abuse.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to conduct adequate due diligence on high-risk customers, ignoring glaring red flags.</p>
<p>TD Bank failed to live up to its responsibilities to the American people.</p>
<p>I want to be clear, these systemic failures did not just create hypothetical vulnerabilities, but they resulted in actual, material harm to American citizens and communities. Time and again, unlike its peers, TD Bank prioritized growth and profit over complying with the law.</p>
<p>The bank enabled drug trafficking. In one example from FinCEN&rsquo;s investigation, TD Bank facilitated over $400 million in transactions to launder money on behalf of criminals that were selling fentanyl and other deadly drugs that are poisoning our neighborhoods. In exchange for filing false or misleading reports on these transactions, TD Bank tellers accepted gift cards as bribes. In another example, TD Bank failed to detect the suspicious activities of one of its own employees who was accepting bribes in exchange for opening accounts in the name of shell companies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why today we are announcing the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network&rsquo;s (FinCEN) $1.3 billion penalty on TD Bank, the largest civil monetary penalty against a bank in Treasury&rsquo;s history.<br />In addition to a historic penalty, TD Bank has agreed to a four-year monitor to oversee its extensive remedial measures, including end-to-end review of its AML program. The bank will also be required to provide missing suspicious activity reports and, for the first time, FinCEN will require additional accountability and data governance reviews to provide recommendations for changing TD Bank&rsquo;s culture of noncompliance.</p>
<p>Together, these requirements hold TD Bank accountable for its egregious and willful disregard of the law and the real harm it caused. This action demonstrates that we are committed to holding individuals and institutions accountable.</p>
<p>Let me end by thanking FinCEN, the IRS Criminal Investigation team, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of Justice for their collaboration. We look forward to continuing to work together to enforce our nation&rsquo;s laws and protect our national security.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Fines Toronto-Dominion Bank $123.5 Million For Violations Related To Anti-Money Laundering Laws</title>

<div> fined, Toronto-Dominion Bank, anti-money laundering, U.S. operations, compliance<br />
Summary: 
The Federal Reserve fined TD Bank $123.5 million for anti-money laundering violations, requiring enhanced measures to comply with U.S. regulations. Canada's OSFI can assist in implementation. Various U.S. agencies are also taking regulatory actions. TD is pleading guilty to criminal charges. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday fined Toronto-Dominion Bank $123.5 million for violations related to anti-money laundering laws. The Board is also requiring TD to implement enhanced measures to comply with anti-money laundering laws and to correct its risk management deficiencies.</p>
<p>TD failed to conduct adequate risk management and oversight of its retail banking operations in the United States, resulting in a U.S. subsidiary being used to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds. The Board's action will help ensure that TD operates in compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Board is requiring TD to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a new office in the United States dedicated to remediating the deficiencies identified in the order;</li>
<li>Relocate to the United States the parts of its anti-money laundering compliance program that are responsible for complying with U.S. law. This program will be subject to oversight by U.S. regulators;</li>
<li>Certify that sufficient resources and attention are allocated to correcting the firm's anti-money laundering deficiencies prior to issuing any dividends or capital distributions; and</li>
<li>Undertake a thorough and independent review of the firm's board of directors and management to ensure adequate oversight of the U.S. operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canada's Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the home country supervisor of TD, can act in the implementation of these requirements as permitted by its legal authority.</p>
<p>This action is being taken in conjunction with criminal and regulatory actions that are being taken by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, the Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The penalties announced by the agencies total approximately $3.09 billion. The bank is also pleading guilty to criminal charges brought by law enforcement authorities.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Cumberland DRW For Operating As An Unregistered Dealer In The Crypto Asset Markets</title>

<div> charged, Cumberland DRW LLC, crypto assets, securities, registration
<br />
Cumberland DRW LLC charged with unregistered dealing of over $2 billion crypto assets as securities. SEC seeks injunction, disgorgement, and penalties.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="article-location-publishdate">The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Chicago-based Cumberland DRW LLC with operating as an unregistered dealer in more than $2 billion of crypto assets offered and sold as securities, in violation of the registration requirements of the federal securities laws that are designed to protect investors.</p>
<p class="article-location-publishdate">According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, since at least March 2018 through the present, Cumberland has acted as an unregistered dealer by buying and selling crypto assets offered and sold as securities for its own accounts as part of its regular business. As alleged in the complaint, Cumberland publicly calls itself &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s leading liquidity providers&rdquo; in crypto assets and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week by trading with counterparties by the telephone or through its online trading platform, Marea. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint further alleges that Cumberland engages in trading crypto assets that are offered and sold as investment contracts on third-party crypto asset exchanges as part of its regular business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal securities laws require all dealers in all securities to register with the Commission, and those who operate in the crypto asset markets are no exception,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit (CACU). &ldquo;Despite frequent protestations by the industry that sales of crypto assets are all akin to sales of commodities, our complaint alleges that Cumberland, the respective issuers, and objective investors treated the offer and sale of the crypto assets at issue in this case as investments in securities, and Cumberland profited from its dealer activity in these assets without providing investors and the market with the important protections afforded by registration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Cumberland with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Andrew McFall of the SEC&rsquo;s Market Abuse Unit and Kathleen Hitchins of the CACU and supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman, Paul Kim, and Mr. Tenreiro of the CACU. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Christopher Martin and Timothy Stockwell and supervised by Jack Kaufman and Mr. Tenreiro.</p>

<title>SEC Issues $12 Million Award To Joint Whistleblowers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> whistleblowers, SEC, enforcement action, award, investor protection fund
Summary:<br />SEC awards $12 million to three whistleblowers for assisting in enforcement action. Whistleblower program offers awards of 10-30% for credible information leading to successful enforcement. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a $12 million award to be split among three joint whistleblowers who provided critical information and assistance in an SEC enforcement action.</p>
<p>The joint whistleblowers provided the SEC significant information and extensive cooperation, which helped expand the scope of the investigation and the charges brought in the enforcement action and also saved the agency substantial time and resources. The joint whistleblowers met numerous times with SEC&rsquo;s enforcement staff and certain of the joint whistleblowers suffered hardships due to their whistleblowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whistleblowers play a key role in helping the SEC hold wrongdoers accountable,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower. &ldquo;Even where an investigation is already open, whistleblowers may contribute by providing new information about misconduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Payments to whistleblowers are made out of an investor protection fund, established by Congress, which is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action.&nbsp;Whistleblower awards can range from 10 to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<title>OCC Issues Cease and Desist Order, Assesses $450 Million Civil Money Penalty, and Imposes Growth Restriction Upon TD Bank, N.A. for BSA/AML Deficiencies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced a cease and desist order and a $450 million civil money penalty against TD Bank, N.A. and TD Bank USA, N.A. (bank), for deficiencies in the bank&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance program. Today&rsquo;s action also imposes a restriction on the growth of the bank and a measure designed to ensure that the bank invests sufficient resources to remediate its BSA/AML deficiencies in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TD Bank&rsquo;s persistent prioritization of growth over controls allowed its employees to break the law and facilitate the laundering of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank&rsquo;s blatant risk management failures attracted illicit actors and are egregious and unacceptable,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;The OCC&rsquo;s coordinated and comprehensive action, including the imposition of an asset cap, will ensure that the bank focuses on building proper controls commensurate with its risk profile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC determined that the bank failed to develop and maintain a BSA/AML program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA and its implementing regulations. Deficiencies in the bank&rsquo;s BSA/AML program included those related to internal controls and risk management practices; risk assessments; customer due diligence; customer risk ratings; suspicious activity identification, evaluation, and reporting; governance; staffing; independent testing; and training, among others.</p>
<p>The OCC found that the bank had significant, systemic breakdowns in its transaction monitoring program. The bank processed hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions with clear indicia of highly suspicious activity, creating a potential for significant money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit financial transactions. The bank repeatedly failed to take appropriate and timely corrective action to address the highly suspicious activity and failed to properly emphasize BSA/AML compliance.</p>
<p>The bank had a systemic breakdown in its processes to identify and report suspicious activity, and a pattern or practice of noncompliance with the suspicious activity report filing requirement, resulting in numerous violations. The bank also violated currency transaction reporting requirements on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>The OCC action is being taken in coordination with concurrent actions by the Department of Justice, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The OCC-assessed penalty will be directed to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against Rimar Capital USA, Inc. (Rimar USA), Rimar Capital, LLC (Rimar LLC), Itai Liptz, and Clifford Boro for making false and misleading statements about Rimar LLC&rsquo;s purported use of artificial intelligence, or AI, to perform automated trading for client accounts and numerous other material misrepresentations. The parties agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges and pay $310,000 in total civil penalties.</p>
<p>According to the SEC order, Liptz, owner and CEO of Rimar LLC and Rimar USA, with the help of Boro, a Rimar USA board member, raised nearly $4 million from 45 investors for the development of Rimar LLC, an investment adviser that was falsely described as having an AI-driven platform for trading securities. The order found that the Rimar entities, Liptz, and Boro also made misrepresentations about Rimar LLC&rsquo;s assets under management and its investment returns. In addition, the order found that Rimar LLC and Liptz obtained advisory clients using the misleading statements and that Liptz misappropriated company funds for personal expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through entities he controlled, Liptz lured investors and clients with multiple fabrications, including with buzzwords about the latest AI technology,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;As AI becomes more popular in the investing space, we will continue to be vigilant and pursue those who lie about their firms&rsquo; technological capabilities and engage in &lsquo;AI washing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Rimar USA, Rimar LLC, Liptz, and Boro consented to the entry of an order finding antifraud violations and to cease and desist from violating the charged provisions. Liptz consented to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $213,611, to pay a $250,000 civil penalty, and to be subject to an investment company prohibition and associational bar with the right to reapply in five years. Boro agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty. Rimar LLC consented to be censured.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/artificial-intelligence-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;about AI and investment fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Payam Danialypour under the supervision of Brent Wilner, Associate Regional Director of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and Mr. Dean. Roberto Grasso of the Division of Examinations, Office of Risk and Strategy assisted with the investigation.</p>

<div> Civil Rights Movement, South Carolina, Entrepreneurship, Economics, Women
Summary:
- Dr. Lisa D. Cook shares her story of growing up, experiences in economics, and the role of entrepreneurs in the economy. She emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship, innovation, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her personal narrative adds a human touch to the discussion of economics and policymaking. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction, Jennet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Let me start by saying my thoughts are with all the people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia who have felt the force of Helene's and Milton's impact. I am saddened by the tragic loss of life and widespread disruption in this region. The Federal Reserve Board and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area. As we normally do in these unfortunate situations, we are encouraging institutions operating in the affected areas to meet the needs of their communities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>It is an honor to stand before you and speak to this group of audacious, innovative women. I am also very happy to be back in Charleston. I grew up in Milledgeville, Georgia, just about 250 miles down the road. Some of my fondest childhood memories of traveling in the South, especially as a Girl Scout, include South Carolina.</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk with you about the important role startups, new businesses, and entrepreneurship play in our economy from the perspective of a Federal Reserve policymaker. I also want to share a bit of my story. Just like many of you&mdash;including those who have started a business or those who dream of doing that someday&mdash;I have faced and overcome hurdles along a winding path.</p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong><br />I was born and raised in Milledgeville, where my mother, Professor Mary Murray Cook, was a faculty member in the Nursing Department of Georgia College and State University. She was the first tenured African American faculty member at that university. My father, Rev. Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain and then in senior leadership at the hospital there. My family lived through the events that brought Milledgeville out of a deeply segregated South. My sisters and I were among the first African American students to desegregate the schools we attended. I drew strength from the example set by my family, others in the Civil Rights Movement, and the village that raised me and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that was not the initial field of study I pursued. I entered Spelman College in Atlanta as a physics and philosophy major. After graduation, I had the honor of studying at the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar.</p>
<p>After Oxford, I continued my education at the University of Dakar in Senegal in West Africa. However, at the end of my year in Africa, it was the chance to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in East Africa where I discovered my love of economics. I hiked alongside a British economist, and, by the end of the trek, he convinced me that studying economics would provide me with the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time.</p>
<p>I went on to earn my Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley<a name="f1"></a>. Entering the economics profession came with its usual challenges, and, for women, a few more challenges existed. To this day, women are still underrepresented in economics. Women earned just 34 percent of bachelor's degrees in economics and 36 percent of Ph.D.'s in economics in 2022, the most recent available data from the U.S. Department of Education. The share of women earning those degrees rose only modestly from 1999, when women earned about 32 percent of economics bachelor's degrees and 27 percent of Ph.D.'s. The data stand in sharp contrast to all science and engineering degrees, including in social science fields, where women earned roughly half of degrees granted in 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Education was paramount in my family and was construed as a means of realizing the promise of the Civil Rights Movement and continual improvement of our society and economy. Of course, economics, like physics, is a field where math skills are vitally important. Between my mother, my aunts, and my extended family, I had essentially understood STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)-related jobs to be women's work. I was grateful to have these role models in my orbit to give me the confidence to undertake study in a STEM field.</p>
<p>Access and encouragement for girls to pursue study in math and science are a significant concern. Economist Dania V. Francis's research shows that Black girls are disproportionately under-recommended for Advanced Placement calculus.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The course is often a gateway for economics, for STEM classes, and for college preparation, in general.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>My mentors and role models encouraged careful study, teaching, and scholarship and helped me block out the voices saying I did not belong at each juncture. They encouraged my work and have been champions for me. As a result, I have been committed to serving as a mentor, as well. For several years, I was the director of and taught in the American Economic Association's Summer Program, an important training ground for disadvantaged students considering economics careers. Each year, the share of students who are women oscillated between 41 percent and 67 percent, much higher than the enrollment in undergraduate economics courses nationally.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;I told those students&mdash;and continue to tell them as they make their way through graduate programs in economics and through the economics profession&mdash;"You belong here. Your insights are unique, and the profession will benefit from them."</p>
<p>In my career as an economist, I studied, researched, and taught in roles at universities and worked in the private sector and in government before I was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate to become a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 2022. I am honored and humbled to serve in this role and proud to be the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors. As Fed policymakers, we make decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American by focusing on the dual mandate given to us by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurs' Vital Role in the Economy</strong><br />In my years of conducting research and while at the Board, I have met many inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs who made important contributions to the economy. Many of them happened to be women who were very knowledgeable, creative, and inspiring. So I want to discuss the vital role entrepreneurship and new business creation play in our economy.</p>
<p>You might ask what interest I have in this subject, as a monetary policymaker focused closely on the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Well, this topic has interested me for a long time, and I conducted a fair amount of research on entrepreneurship and innovation before joining the Board. But the topic is also important precisely because of our dual mandate. To convince you of this, I will explain a few of the ways in which economists think about entrepreneurship, and how they relate to the dual mandate.</p>
<p>The first is the most basic: For many people&mdash;many millions, in fact&mdash;entrepreneurship or self-employment is a career choice.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;It is their preferred way of participating in the labor market and obtaining income for themselves and their families. They prefer to be their own bosses, with all the benefits and risks that entails.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;But whether they end up hiring others or not, self-employed individuals support the labor market by providing a job for themselves.</p>
<p>A second way economists think about entrepreneurship is a little broader: New business creation is a large contributor to overall job growth. In fact, new businesses punch above their weight. For example, during the handful of years before the pandemic, in a typical year only about 8 percent of all employer firms were new entrants, but these new entrants accounted for about 15 percent of annual gross job creation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;And research has found that this job creation effect is long lasting. Even though many new firms do not survive, those that do survive tend to grow rapidly over 5 to 10 years, largely offsetting the job losses from those firms that shut down.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>A third way economists think about entrepreneurship, which I have explored in my own research, is that a small but critical subset of new firms are innovators&mdash;they introduce new products or business processes that change how we consume or produce.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;As such, they make large contributions to overall productivity growth over time. That is, innovative entrepreneurs help enable us to do more with less&mdash;and even more so if access to innovation participation is equitable.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;It is important that everyone, including women, historically underrepresented groups, people from certain geographic regions, and other diverse representative groups, can participate in the entrepreneurship and innovation economy. In my research, I have found that investors underrate the prospects of Black-founded, or simply outsider-founded, startups in early funding stages. Better assessment of the early stages of invention and innovation could broaden the range of new entrants and the ideas they contribute to their local communities and the broader economy.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the Dual Mandate</strong><br />So let's return to the dual mandate. You can now understand that self-employment and entrepreneurial job creation are relevant for our employment mandate. Indeed, one could argue that entrepreneurs are critical to Fed policymakers' efforts to promote maximum employment. And the productivity gains we reap from entrepreneurship are like productivity growth from any other source. When the pace of productivity growth increases, it allows for economic activity and wage growth to be robust while also being consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>The importance of business startups to our dual mandate objectives is why I have watched closely as various measures of new business formation have surged since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Applications for new businesses jumped to a record pace shortly after the pandemic struck the U.S.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The pace of applications has remained elevated above pre-pandemic norms all the way from the summer of 2020 to the most recent data, even though the pace appears to be cooling some this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;At first, it might have seemed like these business applications were mainly being submitted by people who lost their jobs, or perhaps by an increase in "gig economy" work. There was doubtless some of that going on, but research and data since then have painted a more optimistic picture.</p>
<p>When researchers look across areas of the country, the pandemic business applications had only a weak connection with layoffs. The surge in applications persisted long after overall layoffs fell to the subdued pace we have seen since early 2021. The applications did have a strong relationship with workers voluntarily leaving their jobs. Some quitting workers may have chosen to join these new businesses as founders or early employees. And surging business applications were soon followed by new businesses hiring workers and expanding. Over the last two years of available data, new firms created 1.9 million jobs per year, a pace not seen since the eve of the Global Financial Crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>The industry patterns of this surge reflect shifts in consumer and business needs resulting from the pandemic and its aftermath. For example, in large metro areas, new business creation shifted from city centers to the suburbs, perhaps because of the increase in remote work. Suddenly, people wanted to eat lunch or go to the gym closer to their home, rather than close to their downtown office. Likewise, consumer and business tastes for more online purchases, with the shipping requirements that entails, are evident in the surge of business entry in the online retail and transportation sectors. But this is not only about moving restaurants closer to workers or changing patterns of goods consumption. There was also a particularly strong entry into high-tech industries, such as data processing and hosting, as well as research and development services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That may have more to do with developments like artificial intelligence than with the pandemic specifically, as I discussed in a speech in Atlanta last week.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Economists will spend years debating the various causes of the surge in business creation during and soon after the pandemic. Perhaps strong monetary and fiscal policy backstopping aggregate demand played some role, or pandemic social safety net policies, or simply the accommodative financial conditions of 2020 and 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Indeed, more research is needed and will be the subject of many dissertations in the near future.</p>
<p>I do think a large part of the story is ultimately a case of resourceful and determined American entrepreneurs, perhaps including some of you, responding to the tumultuous shocks of the pandemic. They, like some of you, stepped in to meet the rapidly changing needs of households and businesses. This points to a fourth way economists like to think about entrepreneurship, which is that entrepreneurship plays a big role in helping the economy adapt to change. Research suggests that entrepreneurs and the businesses they create are highly responsive to big economic shocks, and the COVID-19 pandemic was certainly a seismic shock.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;To be sure, the future is uncertain. It is unclear what the productivity effects of the pandemic surge of new businesses, particularly in high tech, will be.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;And whether that surge will continue is an open question; after all, the pre-pandemic period was a period of declining rates of new business creation, and the pandemic surge itself does appear to be cooling off recently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />For now, let me say that I am grateful that entrepreneurs continue to give us a hand in meeting our employment mandate, and whatever productivity gains we may reap in coming years as a result may help ease tradeoffs with inflation as well.</p>
<p>Finally, I will share one last story about why South Carolina will always hold a special place in my and my sisters' hearts. Every summer and at Thanksgiving, we would travel through the Palmetto State to our grandparents' house in Winston-Salem. Sitting in the back seat of the station wagon, we were entranced by the many colorful signs along Interstate 95 advertising what I, as a child, viewed as South Carolina's number one attraction: the South of the Border roadside amusement park. We begged our parents to stop every time. It was an epic struggle that went on for more than a decade. Once or twice they did relent, a sweet childhood victory! And here is the funny thing about travels&mdash;paths can cross. The timing is such that my sisters and I may have even been helped by a waiter named Ben, a young man from Dillon, South Carolina, who would go on to be Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke!<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241010a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></span>&nbsp;Perhaps it was the world's way of foreshadowing.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me here in Charleston. It is inspiring to meet this group of bold, entrepreneurial women in South Carolina, and I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>

The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey indicates there are roughly 10 million unincorporated and 7 million incorporated self-employed individuals. Separate data on businesses from the U.S. Census Bureau indicate that, as of 2021, there were about 25 million nonemployer and 800,000 employer sole proprietorships (<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nonemployer-statistics.html">Nonemployer Statistics</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb.html">Statistics of U.S. Businesses</a>).</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Gross job creation refers to all jobs created by entering and expanding establishments. Data are from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics, averaged for 2015&ndash;19. New firms' share of net job creation is much higher, but this is partly an artifact of measurement practices: Firms with an age less than one measured in annual data cannot contribute negatively to net job creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. "Business applications" refers to applications for new Employer Identification Numbers submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.

<br />
The Technology Working Group's final report focuses on AI in asset management, offering use cases and addressing barriers. UK officials praise the report's insights.
<br /><br />Summary: The Technology Working Group's latest report explores AI in UK asset management and provides a blueprint for leveraging its potential, lauded by UK officials. <div>
<p>The Technology Working Group &ndash; chaired by Michelle Scrimgeour and supported by the Investment Association &ndash; has today published its third and final report:&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theia.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F2024-10%2FTechnology%2520Working%2520Group%2520AI%2520Report%2520Oct%25202024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7CDigitalCommunications%40hmtreasury.gov.uk%7C1ae57feda8224516d16408dce903bd74%7Ced1644c505e049e6bc39fcf7ac51c18c%7C0%7C0%7C638641449481040375%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=A5f5WctMCFVrgYgBjiGSZIUg1tNRiIclRMzzkZRFp7U%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">Intelligent Investment: AI Deployment Strategies for UK Investment Management Firms</a>.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines TSB £10.9m Over Treatment Of Customers In Financial Difficulty</title>

<div> fined, TSB Bank plc, arrears, controls, redress
Summary:<br />TSB Bank plc fined £10,910,500 for unfair treatment of customers in arrears, lacked suitable controls, paid £99.9m in redress, breached FCA Principles. <br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined TSB Bank plc (TSB) &pound;10,910,500 for failing to ensure customers who were in arrears were treated fairly.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>It also lacked suitable systems and controls to secure fair outcomes. TSB has paid &pound;99.9m in redress to the 232,849 mortgage, overdraft, credit card and loan customers affected.</span></p>
<p>Between June 2014 and March 2020, TSB&rsquo;s inadequate processes created a real risk that repayment plans were not realistic. Its training did not fully support its staff in understanding customers&rsquo; circumstances. Staff were potentially encouraged by incentive schemes to prioritise the number of plans made over taking enough time to assess individual customer circumstances.</p>
<p>As a result of its failings, TSB risked agreeing unaffordable payment arrangements with customers in difficulty or charging them inappropriate fees. This risked increased uncertainty and stress, including for vulnerable customers.</p>
<p>The extent of the failings were identified by an independent review into TSB&rsquo;s treatment of customers who had fallen into arrears, which had been ordered by the FCA in July 2020.</p>
<p>TSB had become aware of potential problems with its collections and recoveries in December 2016. However, it was not until the review in 2020 that TSB took effective action to fully address them.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, commented:</p>
<p>'If you get into difficulty, you hope for &ndash; and we expect &ndash; fair treatment so a stressful situation isn&rsquo;t made worse. TSB&rsquo;s woeful systems and controls exposed its customers to risk of harm and meant it missed opportunity after opportunity to do the right thing. While it did take action, it took us instigating a review before it acted effectively to address all the issues.'</p>
<p>TSB has worked closely with the independent reviewer and the FCA and has concluded a comprehensive programme to resolve these issues, costing &pound;105m. The FCA continues to supervise all firms to ensure that they have suitable processes in place to support struggling customers.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<li>TSB would have been fined &pound;15,586,500 but it agreed to resolve these matters so qualified for a 30% discount under the FCA&rsquo;s processes.</li>
<li>The FCA requested that a Skilled Person be appointed to review TSB&rsquo;s collections and recoveries in September 2019, following concerns raised both during its own supervision work and by TSB itself. This work was carried out between 2020 and 2023.</li>
<li>TSB breached Principles 3 (Management and control) and 6 (Customers' interests) of the FCA&rsquo;s Principles for Business.</li>

Summary:
The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) report discusses financial risks, global conditions, and policy recommendations for regional stability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The&nbsp;ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) today launched its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.SH2rn1fYDrsFUom0sxl58FhGbWqFSIYaLL4F7TPOgCtWp8pDETO-2F3Ern4JGcBTtj4P4hzbL2D-2BqyfopJRXRuohIOCeszmuIF0VToLDgTtCA-3Dl-4L_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ-2FbfYjrnmw7FS9tH-2Ft9pdIxIDlVc0RCVS1lpR9yQYOBxZqBfK-2Bl1M3bAsJCgy0pMaEB7J86WZsZu7En5jqaO1OcsE418csKCdEZ29qeIXFRQPgmADFmz2VFKnS8llrGhW4d2KK9s4YWNsMPD6qyc29aTfUHOvpwE8qeqvVGMk8ZgqsQC0ry5-2B0F6HsGShevYzmFfJNM5WVZzRViACIEGskAavBz-2FY4sBJnp6X-2BJSmHqQ64f7La9wyMp2TRKMhLh5QNPQXISjae4Xf4OzxQt6WD3qJZJLqyC1DE9HeFxIfPAg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>ASEAN+3 Financial Stability Report (AFSR 2024)</b></a>, which analyzes the latest market developments and potential risks within the ASEAN+3 region, while offering comprehensive analyses on some key challenges confronting the region.&nbsp;Since December 2023, financial risks in the ASEAN+3 region have evolved: while some risks (high inflation, higher for longer interest rate) have subsided, others (geopolitical tensions) have intensified. The region is poised to face a wide range of risks and challenges to financial stability in the near- to long-term.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgfbd2left"><img align="middle" alt="   " id="prnejpgfbd2left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2048913/AMRO_ColorRGB_FA_Logo.jpg" title="   " /></div>
<p>The first half of 2024 experienced an easing in global financial conditions as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) concluded its policy rate hiking cycle. Market movements were primarily influenced by expectations around the Fed's actions. However, in the third quarter of 2024, uncertainties about the US growth outlook, compounded by the unwinding of yen carry trades, sparked notable market volatility. The Fed commenced its monetary easing in September, which has led to an easing of monetary conditions, but uncertainties around inflation and growth outlook linger. Moreover, the geopolitical situation in the Middle East remains fragile and the result of the upcoming US presidential election remains a major source of uncertainties for financial markets.</p>
<p>"Overall, the risk to financial stability across ASEAN+3 in 2024 appears lower than in 2023. The current climate of robust growth and disinflation presents regional policymakers an opportunity to reduce debt, rebuild policy space, and strengthen fiscal capacity to better manage potential shocks. Replenishing foreign exchange reserves during times of capital inflows can further enhance market confidence and provide a buffer against extreme market volatility," said AMRO Chief Economist Hoe Ee Khor.</p>
<p>The thematic studies in AFSR 2024 provide an in-depth analysis of the specific risks confronting the region. ASEAN+3 remains vulnerable to macro-financial shocks from major advanced economies and other external factors, while&nbsp;the growing interconnectivity of ASEAN+3 financial systems underscores the need to take a holistic macroeconomic and financial view of the region to safeguard against systemic risks.</p>
<p>The real estate market downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and high inflation has raised additional concerns, as weakened demand and tighter financial conditions in several economies have severely impacted the financial health of property developers, leading to declining profitability, liquidity, and debt servicing capacity. Robust capital buffers in the banking sector appear to have mitigated spillover risks from the property market, but less visible threats from smaller local banks and shadow banking activities related to the property sector lurk, requiring close monitoring and may necessitate regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>The region's heavy reliance on the US dollar for cross-border financial activities poses two major risks: 1) a potential shortage of US dollar funding, which could destabilize financial markets and intermediaries; and 2) the transmission of global shocks through the US dollar, particularly during periods of monetary tightening or geopolitical tension.</p>
<p><b>Policy recommendations</b></p>
<p>In the near term, ASEAN+3 economies should remain vigilant against the risks of a resurgence of inflation, escalating geopolitical tensions, and a global growth slowdown. Continuous monitoring of international spillovers is crucial, alongside enhancing regional macroeconomic and financial surveillance and cooperation. Critical measures include strengthening cross-border surveillance and data sharing, conducting regional stress testing, enhancing home-host supervision, and strengthening the regional financial safety net.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measures to stabilize the property sector should be implemented to prevent fundamentally sound companies from defaulting due to tight credit conditions&nbsp;driven by a worsening market, while enhancing&nbsp;the soundness&nbsp;of financial institutions&nbsp;with significant exposure, especially smaller banks and nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs).</p>
<p>To strengthen resilience against external shocks in a dollar-dependent environment, ASEAN+3 economies should reinforce their economic and financial fundamentals, enhance surveillance frameworks for monitoring US dollar liquidity, fortify macroprudential measures for banks and NBFIs, and provide financing support to member economies experiencing US dollar liquidity stresses. Furthermore, reducing structural reliance on the US dollar in the medium- to long-term by promoting the use of local currencies and developing cross-currency payment systems should be a key priority.</p>
<p>"To tackle the near- to long-term risks and challenges to ASEAN+3's financial stability, the region must come together as one and strive for resilience and stability," emphasized Dr. Khor.</p>

<title>Acuiti And SGX Group Launch Global Derivatives Market Sentiment Index</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/acuiti-and-sgx-group-launch-global-derivatives-market-sentiment-index/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acuiti and Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released the SGX Global Market Sentiment Index, a barometer of sentiment from across the global derivatives market.</p>
<p>The Sentiment Index is based on a quarterly poll of Acuiti&rsquo;s Expert Networks, comprising senior, derivatives-focused executives from hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms and the sell-side.</p>
<p>Each quarter, Acuiti surveys Expert Network members on their outlook for the next three months to compile the benchmark. The report also draws on data compiled by Acuiti over the past 12 months to build the historic data.</p>
<p>Going forward, the report will provide a temperature check on sentiment across the market, with an analysis of what is driving change across company types.</p>
<p>This first report found that overall industry sentiment was positive in Q3 2024 with 68% of respondents feeling optimistic about the three months ahead. This was an increase from 65% last quarter.</p>
<p>The increase in optimism was driven by a strengthening of sentiment from the sell-side and proprietary trading firms.</p>
<p>However, for some, particularly asset managers, the volatility experienced during the quarter came as an unwelcome development as fears for performance over the rest of the year dented confidence.</p>
<p>Overall, however, 2024 is shaping up to be another record year for volumes across the global derivatives market and sentiment generally remains positive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with SGX Group to launch the SGX Global Market Sentiment Report. The report aggregates data that we collect from across our global networks and provides in one report a snapshot of sentiment across the derivatives market,&rdquo; says Will Mitting, founder of Acuiti.</p>

<div> Federal Open Market Committee, interest rate cut, U.S. stock markets, Thai equities, SET Index<br />
Summary:<br />
FOMC announced a rate cut, boosting U.S. stock markets. Thai equities rallied on domestic tailwinds, with SET Index closing at a 6.6% gain. TFEX daily trading volume increased in September. Thai stock market's forward P/E ratio and dividend yield ratio at the end of September. Newly listed companies on SET and mai in September. <div>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 0.5 percentage point cut in its policy interest rate to the target range of 4.75 percent &ndash; 5.0 percent. This marked the first rate cut in over four years, aimed at balancing risks to employment and inflation target. U.S. stock markets reacted positively, signaling that investors no longer expect a recession. Historically, The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts have boosted emerging market equities. Recent foreign capital inflows into ASEAN bourses spurred rallies in most regional stock indices in September, led by Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore, in descending order.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that Thai equities rallied on domestic tailwinds, including a clearer political landscape following the new Prime Minister's appointment, stronger-than-expected Thai economic growth, and increased institutional investment driven by stock market-related measures. This performance coincided with a strong rebound of foreign buying volume, which reached a 22-month high and triggered a rapid appreciation of Thai baht. However, the sensitivity analysis suggests that the currency strength may hurt future earnings forecasts of export and tourism stocks, while domestic pure-plays and import-intensive manufacturers may benefit from lower costs. The SET Index registered a notable upswing with heavy trading volume in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for</b><b> </b><b>September</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2024, the SET Index closed at 1,448.83 points, up 6.6 percent from the previous month - the highest gain since August 2021. The benchmark index rose 2.3 percent from the end of 2023. </li>
<li>Thai stocks rose across the board. For the nine months to September, industry groups that outpaced the SET Index were Technology, Consumer Products, and Agro &amp; Food Industry.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in September 2024 increased 26.4 percent over the same period last year and 35.8 percent from the preceding month to THB 62.5 billion (approx. USD 1.94 billion). For the first nine months of 2024, the daily trading value averaged at THB 46.48 billion.&nbsp; </li>
<li>In September, one newly listed company on SET was Petchsrivichai Enterprise pcl (PCE), and two newly listed on mai were SEI Medical pcl (SEI) and PMC Label Materials pcl (PMC).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of September 2024 was 15.8 times, above the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 13.0 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 17.5 times, exceeding the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 15.6 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of September 2024 was 3.28 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.04 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in September 2024 averaged 707,472 contracts, up 41.9 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures. For the first nine months of 2024, TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume dropped 13.5 percent over the same period last year to 474,728 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures.</li>

</div>
<p>Organized on October 2nd in London by The Payment Association, the PAY360 Awards celebrate companies that push technological boundaries in the payments industry. Arf's Silver Award highlights its pioneering efforts to leverage blockchain technology and digital assets to create real-time, on-chain liquidity solutions, driving efficiency and transparency in cross-border payments.</p>
<p>This award reflects Arf's mission to solve global liquidity challenges&nbsp;with compliant, scalable solutions and empower financial institutions with instant and secure access to liquidity. Earlier this year, Arf merged with Huma Finance, integrating its liquidity solutions into Huma's PayFi network. This merger has accelerated growth, with Arf's on-chain liquidity volume surpassing $2 billion and loan volume exceeding $1 billion, further expanding its impact in transforming the global payments landscape.</p>

<div> Keywords: Interbrand, brand value, Apple, automotive brands, luxury brands<br />
Summary: Interbrand's 25-year analysis emphasizes the importance of long-term brand investment, with Apple leading despite a drop and automotive and luxury brands showing resilience. The ranking also sees new entrants and re-entrants. <br /><br />Summary: Over-reliance on short-term tactics overlooks long-term revenue potential; Apple leads despite a drop, automotive brands dominate, luxury brands show resilience, and new entrants join the ranking. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>25 years of Interbrand data shows the financial consequence of focusing on performance marketing over long-term brand investment</b></li>
<li><b>Ferrari (#62) and YouTube (#24) have seen the biggest brand value increase in this year's Best Global Brands ranking</b></li>

</ul>
<p>Global brand&nbsp;consultancy Interbrand today launched its annual&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.wrLxKGHf-2BZMfLEH6Xvy2ArSC-2BvkHhlFIcSIHhZQQ4Dii6cfNRlsXeMCMFWHLLlb7H15f_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ0Zm7xgpZDmgntgaaDlv19Yj4MGJEXqupF5q0ONFDV0Yz1sE7CcqIumt0B1BEBMvaNlZDPYwKOS6Agyr08YK4HjjNa-2FHw6-2BcTFQZoLS7UuOUFZuNpIVzTzoZzljDpSBFp3DaqcadFtE4bUFEXtsMb-2F3hnB6CRqW8PZQZXQD6CLS0X1g4lWNKd8Ebaq0LecQq0njJjM-2B2fEzYZRHpugMnS1cy066mEeORXPmrY0M43M2l2bzoV73jrnzhtHjbxQ-2Fe7VBT4LXPzh9N9SZ-2BKGCcpqVdAnBWBHp46LPUdejZkXqk-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Best Global Brands</a>&nbsp;ranking, marking a quarter of a century of brand valuation analysis.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpge8ebleft"><img align="middle" alt="Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2024" id="prnejpge8ebleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2526717/Interbrand_Best_Global_Brands_2024_Infographic.jpg" title="Interbrand's Best Global Brands 2024" /></div>
<p>Since 2000, Interbrand's longitudinal study has tracked and reported on the value of the world's biggest brands. A quarter century of analysis reveals that while performance marketing tactics can drive short-term financial gains, a lack of investment in long-term brand strategy has left the Best Global Brands with at least $3.5T of unrealized value. For this last year, this equates to $200B of lost revenue.</p>
<p>The cumulative value of the world's most valuable brands has increased 3.4x since Interbrand first published its ranking (from $988B USD to $3.4T USD).</p>
<p>Gonzalo Bruj&oacute;, Global CEO, Interbrand said: "If these brands had been treated and managed as strategic growth assets, then this table could be worth as much as $6.9T. The growth we see hides a staggering missed opportunity."</p>
<p><b>Apple holds the top spot</b></p>
<p>Apple remains the most valuable brand, but its brand value has dropped for the first time in over two decades (-3%).</p>
<p>Commenting on Apple, Greg Silverman, Global Director of Brand Economics, Interbrand said: "While others rushed into AI, Apple took a more deliberate path to ensure its AI releases matched its values. This slower-moving act of leadership has put long-term trust ahead of short-term revenue gains. Following these brand moves, Apple's stock has moved up 20% YTD and we anticipate that Apple's value will increase in the 2025 rankings."</p>
<p><b>Automotive brands dominate 2024</b></p>
<p>14 of the top 100 brands of 2024 are automotive, making up more than any other sector in the ranking. Three auto brands &ndash; Toyota (#6), Mercedes-Benz (#8) and BMW (#10) &ndash; appear in the top 10. However, not all auto brands have achieved such success. Tesla (#12) has one of this year's largest declines in brand value (-9%). Meanwhile, Kia (#86), Hyundai (#30) and Toyota (#6) achieved double digit growth.</p>
<p><b>Top-tier luxury shows resilience through innovation</b></p>
<p>Luxury's brand value continued an upward trajectory (+7%, up from + 6.5% last year), extending relevance by creating new consumer experiences and expanded digital touchpoints, demonstrating powerful creativity that taps into the human condition.</p>
<p>Ferrari (#62) captured this year's spot as the top-rising brand, with +21% brand value growth. Louis Vuitton jumped three places (#14 to #11) with Herm&egrave;s (#22) and Prada (#83) two of the biggest luxury brand risers this year, seeing brand value growth of +15% and +14% respectively.</p>
<p><b>Meet the 2024 new entrants</b></p>
<p>Nvidia (#36), Pandora (#91), Range Rover (#96), and Jordan (#99) are this year's new entrants &ndash; and Jordan is the first personality brand to make it onto the table. Uber (#78) and LG (#97) re-enter.</p>
<p><b>Marketing landscape changes over 25 years</b></p>
<p>Over the past 25 years, Interbrand has observed a significant shift in the ways company boardrooms approach growth. C-Suites are prioritizing lower total investments with more immediate returns. Strategies that integrate long-term brand equity with short-term revenue gains are becoming the gold standard &ndash; but these strategies are still surprisingly rare.</p>
<p>Bruj&oacute; said: "Performance tools, capabilities and systems have evolved over the past quarter century. As these tools shift, so do the pressures and expectations placed on brand and marketing leaders. Today, CMOs are expected to deliver greater revenue returns, in shorter time frames, for a&nbsp;lower investment.</p>
<p>"Many of the world's most valuable brands are missing out on significant earning potential by over-investing in short-term gains. Our analysis shows these gains, when tied predominantly to short-term tactics, can undermine a company's mid- to long-term revenue potential."</p>

<div> CFTC-regulated, options, VIX futures, volatility, Cboe <br />
Summary:
Cboe launches new Options on VIX Futures physically settling into front-month VIX futures, offering risk management tools for managing market volatility. The launch complements existing volatility offerings. IMC US, Prime Trading, and Melqart KEAL Macro Fund welcome the expansion and will incorporate the new product in their portfolios. The contracts will have European-style exercise, P.M. settlement, and will be regulated by the CFTC and cleared by the OCC. A webinar will be held on October 11 to discuss the trading ease and accessibility of Options on VIX Futures. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>New&nbsp;CFTC-regulated options on futures will physically settle into front-month Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) Futures</li>
<li>Designed to offer market participants the ability to more granularly manage volatility</li>
<li>Further expansion of Cboe's volatility complex following launch of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced its new Options on Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) Futures (Ticker: UX) are planned to begin trading on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) on Monday, October 14.</p>
<p>The new Options on VIX Futures will provide investors an additional tool to help manage U.S. equity market volatility, complementing Cboe's existing securities-based VIX Index options, which are designed to provide similar risk management and yield enhancement capabilities. Utilizing an option-on-future structure, the new product may allow more market participants, including those restricted from accessing securities-based options, to trade a VIX options product.</p>
<p>Cboe's VIX Index options have seen record trading volumes during the last two years, with average daily volumes reaching over 851,000 contracts in 2024, up approximately 60% from 2022, as more investors have sought utility the options offer.</p>
<p>"Investors have long utilized VIX options and VIX futures to help hedge and manage volatility exposure, and Cboe is proud to expand our volatility product suite at such a critical time," said Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "With its options-on-futures structure, the new Options on VIX Futures will look to meet growing customer demand as Cboe works to provide an efficient and seamless experience to both existing and new CFE market participants. The launch will complement our existing volatility offerings, including the recently launched Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance futures, and enable more investors with the ability to help manage volatility and risk through the election season and beyond."</p>
<p>"20 years after Cboe launched VIX futures, followed by VIX options, and helped establish volatility as an asset class, we continue to prioritize product innovation, engage with our customers and bring new exchange-traded volatility derivatives to market," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "We believe there is a strong demand for risk management tools, especially as investors prepare for the upcoming election and the recent change in the Fed's monetary policy. We've seen a shift in how investors are using options on a day-to-day basis, and with Options on VIX Futures having a mid-curve structure and the ability to offer short-term exposure, investors are expected to be able to manage short-term volatility with greater precision."</p>
<p>Christine Hansen, CEO at IMC US, said: "We are proud to support the expansion of listed volatility offerings from Cboe to meet the varying needs of investors"</p>
<p>Tom Chlada, Chief Operating Officer at Prime Trading, said: "Prime's investment philosophy is to protect and grow capital, and Cboe's new Options on VIX Futures will be a very welcomed addition to our toolkit, enabling us to better express views on volatility and fine-tune our risk management approach. We believe the new options will help boost participation and trading opportunities in the volatility space, and we look forward to incorporating this tool in our portfolios."</p>
<p>Keith DeCarlucci, Chief Investment Officer at Melqart KEAL Macro Fund, said: "VIX futures and options play an important role when managing portfolios, and we welcome Cboe's further expansion of its exchange-traded volatility tools with Options on VIX Futures. Combined with the recent variance futures launch, we have two new products to leverage."</p>
<p>Options on VIX futures will have European-style exercise, P.M. settlement and physically settle into front-month VIX future. At launch, CFE will list contract expirations for every day the week of October 21 with two additional Friday expirations. Each weekday beginning October 21, CFE plans to list a new contract for trading expiring on the same weekday in the week or weeks following.</p>
<p>The contracts will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and cleared by The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC).</p>
<p>The upcoming launch of Options on VIX Futures follows the recent launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4274862-1&amp;h=3145069619&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Ftradable_products%2Fvariance_futures%2F&amp;a=Cboe+S%26P+500+Variance+(VA)+futures" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance (VA) futures</a>, which are designed to offer a streamlined approach to trading the spread between implied and realized volatility. Both products add to Cboe's existing volatility suite and provide investors with exchange-traded solutions to manage market volatility ahead of and following the U.S. election.</p>
<p>On Friday, October 11 at 8:30 am ET, Cboe will be hosting a webinar with speakers from Allspring Global, IMC Financial Markets, and Golden Horse Fund Management on how Options on VIX Futures can enhance trading ease and accessibility. To register for the webinar, please&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4274862-1&amp;h=1124207522&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2F6217271956347%2FWN_Rg95Lf3vQpigZP5lca4c_g&amp;a=click+here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<title>SEC Charges Three So-Called Market Makers And Nine Individuals In Crackdown On Manipulation Of Crypto Assets Offered And Sold As Securities</title>

<div> fraud charges, market manipulation, crypto assets, securities, retail investors
Summary: SEC announces fraud charges against companies and individuals for manipulating markets for crypto assets offered as securities to retail investors. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced fraud charges against three companies purporting to be market makers and nine individuals for engaging in schemes to manipulate the markets for various crypto assets being offered and sold as securities to retail investors. As alleged, the schemes were intended to induce investor victims to purchase the crypto assets by creating the false appearance of an active trading market for them.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaints, crypto asset promoters Russell Armand, Maxwell Hernandez, Manpreet Singh Kohli, Nam Tran, and Vy Pham (Promoters) hired so-called market makers ZM Quant and Gotbit to provide market-manipulation-as-a-service, which included generating artificial trading volume or manipulating the price of crypto assets that the Promoters offered and sold as securities to retail investors in unregistered transactions. The SEC also alleged that ZM Quant and a third so-called market maker, CLS Global, undertook similar schemes to manipulate the market of a crypto asset offered and sold as a security that was created at the direction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of its parallel investigation into potential market manipulation in the crypto asset industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s enforcement actions demonstrate, once more, that retail investors are being victimized by fraudulent activity by institutional actors in the markets for crypto assets,&rdquo; said Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;With purported promoters and self-anointed market makers teaming up to target the investing public with false promises of profits in the crypto markets, investors should be mindful that the deck may be stacked against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that ZM Quant and its employees Baijun Ou and Ruiqi Lau, Gotbit and its employee Fedor Kedrov, and CLS Global and its employee Andrey Zhorzhes manipulated markets on behalf of the Promoters by self-trading (commonly referred to as &ldquo;wash trading&rdquo;) on popular crypto asset trading platforms or by engaging in other trading practices that likewise served no economic purpose, and that they used algorithms (or bots) that, at times, generated quadrillions of transactions and billions of dollars of artificial trading volume each day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remain concerned about the ease with which the market for a crypto asset can be manipulated and are committed to rooting out instances of such misconduct when it involves securities,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit (CACU). &ldquo;The wrongdoers behind these schemes are profiting handsomely at the expense of investors that have been deceptively lured into these markets and lost their hard-earned savings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s five complaints, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, allege that all defendants violated the antifraud and market manipulation provisions of the securities laws and that certain defendants violated registration provisions. The complaints seek permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties against all the defendants, as well as officer and director bars against certain defendants. Armand, Hernandez, and Pham consented to bifurcated settlements, subject to court approval, permanently enjoining them from further violations of the federal securities laws, subjecting them to conduct-based injunctions, and barring them from acting as officers or directors. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and any civil penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of Massachusetts, which today announced parallel criminal actions.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations were conducted by David D&rsquo;Addio, Amy Harman Burkart, Ivan Panchenko, Jeffrey Cook, and John McCann in the SEC&rsquo;s Boston Regional Office, as well as Colin Missett and Joy Guo of the CACU. They were supervised by Amy Gwiazda, Michael Brennan, Donald Battle, and Mr. Tenreiro of CACU and by Celia Moore and John T. Dugan of the Boston Regional Office. The team also thanks the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology for their assistance. The litigations will be led by Mr. D&rsquo;Addio and Ms. Burkart.</p>

<title>SEC Charges “Magic Mushroom” Company And Two Individuals With Multimillion Dollar Pump-And-Dump Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SEC, Minerco Inc., pump-and-dump scheme, fraudulent activities, stock manipulation <br />
Summary: SEC charges Minerco Inc., Shumake, and Jenge for pump-and-dump scheme, defrauding investors, false statements, seeks injunctions and penalties.<br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Minerco Inc. (former over-the-counter ticker: MINE), Bobby Shumake Japhia, and Julius Makiri Jenge, for their roles in an alleged pump-and-dump scheme that defrauded investors out of approximately $8 million while generating millions of dollars in ill-gotten proceeds from sales of Minerco stock.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, in the fall of 2019, Shumake, who was formerly known as Robert Samuel Shumake, Jr., secretly gained control of a large stock position in Minerco, an inactive penny stock company, and then arranged for Jenge to assume control of Minerco. The defendants then began pumping Minerco&rsquo;s stock price by promoting Minerco as the &ldquo;first publicly traded company focused on the research, production, and distribution of psilocybin mushrooms.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/psilocybin">Psilocybin</a>&nbsp;is the principal psychoactive component in &ldquo;magic mushrooms,&rdquo; a plant-based hallucinogen.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2021, the defendants allegedly continued to pump Minerco stock by making public statements and disclosures that contained false and misleading information. For example, Shumake and Minerco allegedly issued press releases falsely suggesting that an independent third party had valued Minerco at $1 billion and that Minerco had partnered with a Jamaican company that would lend expertise in growing a unique strain of psilocybin and bequeath to Minerco its Jamaican cannabis licenses. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleges that Jenge and Minerco falsely claimed in public disclosures that Minerco was an active Nevada company when, in reality, its charter had been revoked. Finally, Shumake allegedly engaged an offshore company to &ldquo;dump&rdquo; his Minerco shares and ultimately transfer at least $3.4 million in ill-gotten gains to an entity Shumake controlled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged here, pump-and-dumps often begin when cheap stock of dormant companies is suddenly touted by a promoter as the next big thing,&rdquo; said Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action serves as an important reminder that the SEC will remain steadfast in its efforts to root out of the market stock offerings that are more about hype than substance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC previously obtained an Order compelling Jenge to produce documents and appear for testimony pursuant to an investigative subpoena issued by the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, charges Minerco, Shumake, and Jenge with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties against each defendant, as well as conduct-based injunctions and penny stock and officer-and-director bars against Shumake and Jenge.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation, which is ongoing, is being conducted by Adam Eisner, Brittany Garmyn, Keith O&rsquo;Donnell, and Zachary Scrima and supervised by C. Joshua Felker and Ms. Hodgman. Damon Taaffe will lead the litigation team under the supervision of David Nasse. The SEC appreciates the assistance of FINRA, OTC Markets Group, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, the Jamaica Financial Services Commission, the Qu&eacute;bec Autorit&eacute; des March&eacute;s Financiers, the Capital Markets Board of T&uuml;rkiye, and the Belize Financial Services Commission.</p>
<p>The SEC encourages investors to take&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/investor-0">certain steps to identify</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/pump-and-dump-schemes">pump-and-dump schemes</a>&nbsp;involving the stocks of dormant shell companies.</p>

<div> report, OSC, gamification, investors, trading simulation<br />
<br />
The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) released a report on the impact of gamification on investors, launching a trading simulation tool to test online trading behaviors. Summary: OSC report on gamification impact, new trading tool, social engagement influences behavior, findings guide regulatory response.<br /> <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today released a new report that studied the impact of gamification on investors. Along with this research, the OSC launched a new trading simulation tool for investors to test how online gamification tactics can influence their investing behaviour.</p>
<p>The report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/gamification-revisited-new-experimental-findings-retail-investing">Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span>&nbsp;looks at whether promoting certain assets on digital investing platforms presents a risk to investors. The tool,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://getsmarterabouttrading.ca/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">GetSmarterAboutTrading.ca<span>&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">provides people with a chance to participate in a simulated stock market and practice online trading. It exposes users to gamification techniques to show them what could be influencing their investing behaviour.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Digital investing platforms are increasingly popular and make it easier for retail investors to participate in financial markets, but there is growing regulatory concern over the use of gamification techniques on these platforms,&rdquo; said Leslie Byberg, Executive Vice President, Strategic Regulation at the OSC. &ldquo;The research we published today, along with the GetSmarterAboutTrading tool will help people better understand the impact of gamification techniques on their trading behaviour and help investors make more informed decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OSC conducted an experiment where participants received virtual &ldquo;money&rdquo; to invest in fictional stocks on a made-up trading platform. Participants took part in simulated trading where stocks were promoted in different ways. The research found two types of promotion had a significant impact on participants&rsquo; trading behaviours; those who saw promoted stocks featured on a social feed traded 12% more in those stocks, and those who had the option to copy the trades of a &ldquo;high performing&rdquo; user traded 18% more in the promoted stocks.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that these social engagement techniques can influence investor behaviours by encouraging trading in specific assets. This influence is likely to have a negative impact, potentially through under-diversification or excessive risk taking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/gamification-revisited-new-experimental-findings-retail-investing">Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</a>&nbsp;builds on the work of an earlier OSC research report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-796/digital-engagement-practices-retail-investing-gamification-other-behavioural-techniques"><em>Digital Engagement Practices in Retail Investing: Gamification and Other Behavioural Techniques</em></a><em>.</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The 2022 report included the results of an online experiment showing the impact of &ldquo;points&rdquo; and &ldquo;top-traded lists&rdquo; on user trading.The experiment found participants rewarded with points for buying and selling stocks made 39% more trades and those who saw a list of top traded stocks were 14% more likely to buy and sell those stocks. More frequent trading generally has a negative impact on investor returns.</p>
<p>The OSC&rsquo;s research into gamification is an important example of taking evidence-informed approaches to securities regulation. This report also contains several recommendations for how regulators and authorities in Canada and abroad might respond to the ongoing use of digital engagement practices by online investing platforms. This could include updates to regulations and guidance for digital trading platforms and potentially limiting problematic digital engagement practices that research indicates can compromise investor protection.</p>
<p>October marks Investor Education Month in Canada, and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/?p=home" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">World Investor Week</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>a global initiative of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, takes place October 7-13. Today&rsquo;s launch is part of OSC efforts to raise awareness about the importance of investor education and protection.</p>

<p><span>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk.

<div> Guidelines, redemption, token holders, crisis, issuer
Summary: 
The EBA published final Guidelines on token holder redemption in issuer crises, covering ARTs and EMTs, with amendments for clarity and flexibility. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Guidelines on the orderly redemption of token holders in case of crisis of the issuer. The Guidelines, which are addressed to competent authorities designated under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), cover issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and of e-money tokens (EMTs).</span></p>
<p>The Guidelines&nbsp;specify the content of the redemption plan to be developed by issuers of ARTs and EMTs in going concern, including the liquidation strategies of the reserve of assets, the mapping of critical activities, the content of the redemption claims, the main steps of the redemption process, and the elements that may lead to the trigger of the plan by the competent authority.</p>
<p>Considering the feedback received during the public consultation, a&nbsp;few targeted amendments have been made to streamline the wording and provide further clarity on some specific aspects. For instance, some clarifications allow for flexibility so that the guidance addressed to issuers of ARTs relating to the liquidation of the reserve of assets can be used, to some extent, also by issuers of EMTs.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The Guidelines on redemption plans&nbsp;have been developed according to Article 47(5) of MiCAR. By virtue of the cross-reference set out in Article 55 MiCAR, the Guidelines also cover&nbsp;issuers of e-money tokens, as applicable.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The Fed's Discount Window: 1990 To The Present, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson, At The Charlotte Economics Club, Charlotte, North Carolina</title>

<div> Federal Reserve, discount window, monetary policy, primary credit, economy <br />
<br />Summary: The article discusses the historical perspective and evolution of the discount window, recent changes, outreach efforts, technology enhancements, and future steps. <div>
<p>Thank you, Steve, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>Yesterday I shared my historical perspective on the discount window at Davidson College.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In 1913, when the Federal Reserve was established, the discount window was the main tool it used to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. More than 110 years later, the discount window continues to play an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and the effective implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today I would like to discuss with you how the discount window has evolved in the 21st century, including recent steps the Federal Reserve Board has taken to solicit feedback from the public on discount window operations. Before I address our most recent efforts, however, I will review some important episodes in discount window history that brought us to where we are today.</p>
<p>First, I will recount briefly events in the 1980s and early 1990s that provide important context for the reappraisal of the discount window in the early 2000s. Second, I will summarize revisions to the discount window that the Fed made in 2003 and some additional changes made since then. Third, I will describe efforts that the Fed has taken to ensure that the discount window remains effective today, including the request for information that the Board recently issued on operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit. After completing my discussion of the discount window, I will conclude with my outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>Events before the 2003 Discount Window Revisions</strong><br />I would like to pick up today where I left off yesterday in my speech at Davidson College: the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a period of widespread problems in the commercial banking sector. Troubled institutions borrowed from the discount window for extended periods of time as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the closure of these institutions. As a result, the discount window became associated strongly with lending to troubled institutions. Healthy banks' reluctance to borrow from the discount window increased. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This led to a reassessment of the discount window in the early 2000s and to eventual revisions implemented in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>A Reassessment of the Discount Window in the Early 2000s</strong><br />The key challenge in the reassessment of the discount window was to establish a lending program that would not only operate effectively and support monetary policy implementation, but also mitigate moral hazard and provide sufficient controls to minimize risk to Reserve Banks and, ultimately, to American taxpayers. After the reassessment, the Fed implemented several changes aimed to achieve the right balance.</p>
<p>The Board replaced the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a below-market rate, with a new type of discount window credit called primary credit. This new type of discount window credit became effective in 2003.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It is available as a backup source of liquidity to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition at an above-market rate. Making the discount rate a penalty rate is more consistent with the long-standing practice of other major central banks. This feature was intended to reduce the need for administrative pressures based on Reserve Bank staff judgment of inappropriate usage when the discount rate was below market rates. Although those measures effectively limited usage that was deemed inappropriate at the time, they also presented communication challenges regarding when it was appropriate to use the discount window and perpetuated the perception that the Fed discouraged its use.</p>
<p>Primary credit is a "no questions asked" facility in which eligible depository institutions are no longer required to have exhausted other sources of funding or be subject to restrictions on the use of the borrowed funds. The Fed initially set the primary credit rate 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Since March 2020, the Fed has set the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>At the same time primary credit was established, another new program, called secondary credit, replaced the extended credit program. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It was initially available at an interest rate 50 basis points higher than the primary credit rate, which is the spread in effect today. In contrast to primary credit, extensions under secondary credit are subject to higher collateral discounts and may involve ongoing oversight on the use of funds obtained under the program, reflecting the less-sound condition of secondary credit borrowers. Typically, Reserve Banks review a depository institution's plan to repay the loan and return to market sources of funding.</p>
<p>This two-tiered structure of providing the no-questions-asked primary credit program for healthy depository institutions and the secondary credit program for less-than-healthy depository institutions was designed primarily to instill public confidence in the health of institutions borrowing from the primary credit program and to reduce the reluctance of healthy depository institutions to borrow.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In addition, having two separate facilities would reinforce the notion that healthy and troubled depository institutions alike should regard borrowing from the Fed as an option in the event of a need for additional funds.</p>
<p>In the early years of the switch to the new facilities, there were signs that healthy depository institutions became more willing to borrow from the discount window. For example, some research found that after the 2003 discount window revisions, banks borrowed more from the discount window when the federal funds rate spiked than they had previously.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This finding suggests that the redesign of the discount window was effective in reducing banks' reluctance to borrow. As a result, the discount window may have been more effective in placing a ceiling on short-term funding rates, aiding the implementation of monetary policy, and serving as a liquidity tool when needed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to measure reluctance to borrow from the discount window. When the interest rate on primary credit is above the target federal funds rate and the federal funds rate is close to its target, the aggregate volume of primary credit is expected to be low. In other words, a low average level of discount window borrowing does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow; instead, it could simply reflect a situation in which depository institutions do not currently need to borrow. In addition, when there is an abundance of liquidity in the banking system, as is the case in the current ample-reserves monetary policy regime, depository institutions may have less need to obtain additional liquidity via the discount window. Again, this does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow. Conversely, the presence of discount window borrowing does not necessarily reflect the absence of a reluctance to borrow. It could be the case that, although aggregate usage increases, there are still some depository institutions that are willing to pay well above the primary credit rate even when they could have borrowed readily from the discount window. For these reasons, it is important that we complement data with market outreach information to assess the effectiveness of the discount window.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and Challenges since the Introduction of Primary and Secondary Credit</strong><br />Primary and secondary credit exist today, but some changes have been made to primary credit since its inception. For example, although the discount window was used extensively and played an important role in the emergency measures taken during the financial crisis of 2007&ndash;09, some depository institutions during this period still were willing to borrow funds from the market at rates above the discount rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This suggested that there was a reluctance to borrow before the crisis, and that reluctance appeared to grow over the course of the crisis. To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets and provide depository institutions with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding, the Board approved temporary changes to its primary credit discount window facility during the crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in late 2007, the Board established the Term Auction Facility (TAF).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Concerns about lending to troubled depository institutions reemerged after the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 2010, Congress required the Fed to publish detailed individual institution borrowing data with a two-year lag.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This action was intended to enhance the transparency and accountability of Federal Reserve lending while still preserving a measure of confidentiality to avoid discouraging depository institutions from borrowing.</p>
<p>More recently, in March 2020, the Fed announced changes to the provision of primary credit that were intended to encourage depository institutions to use the discount window to meet demands for credit from households and businesses in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes included setting the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the federal funds target range&mdash;a step that enhanced the ability of the discount window to support trading within the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate&mdash;and communicating the terms of borrowing as 90 days, prepayable and renewable on a daily basis. To further encourage depository institutions to use the discount window, the Fed also made changes to its reporting of Reserve Bank&ndash;level aggregate weekly discount window borrowing. It consolidated amounts previously reported as "loans," which include discount window borrowing, into a broader category of assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The changes made in 2020 remain in effect.</p>
<p>During and after the spring 2023 stress events, the discount window again played an important role in supporting both monetary policy and financial stability. Depository institutions that came under severe stress turned to the discount window. The discount window also served an important role in providing ready access to funding, especially for depository institutions experiencing spillovers from the bank failures. To further ensure that depository institutions had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, the Board announced the creation of a new emergency program, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). Although the BTFP was established pursuant to the Board's emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the BTFP used the discount window infrastructure to lend to eligible depository institution borrowers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;By relying on the existing discount window infrastructure, the BTFP was able to begin operating right away. The program ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024, as scheduled.</p>
<p>Today the discount window continues to be an effective tool, but it is important to acknowledge that economic and banking conditions continue to evolve. Since the 2003 discount window reassessment, we have seen an increased focus on liquidity in banking regulation, including the advent of quantitative liquidity requirements for large banking organizations; technological changes in the banking system; a general trend toward faster and 24-7-365 payment systems; changes in the composition and posture of Federal Home Loan Bank lending; and the move to an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve System has taken important steps to ensure that the discount window performs its functions successfully in the 21st-century economy. For example, last year the Board, along with the other federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration, issued guidance on contingency funding plans that encouraged depository institutions to be ready to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;This includes taking steps to establish borrowing relationships with the Federal Reserve, such as providing certain legal documentation and ensuring that collateral to secure loans is ready to pledge. In connection with interagency initiatives, Reserve Banks have conducted outreach to depository institutions and made efforts to guide them in using the discount window.</p>
<p>Data suggest that this encouragement is working. By the end of 2023, 3,900 banks, or roughly 80 percent of all banks, had completed the legal documentation required to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Of those, nearly 2,000 banks had pledged collateral, with an aggregate lendable value of over $2.6 trillion after applying appropriate discounts. These figures are notably above their levels at the end of 2021 and 2022. Although I am pleased to see the improvements in discount window readiness statistics, continued outreach is still important. To that effect, this summer, Federal Reserve Banks hosted an Ask the Fed&reg; session to discuss the purpose of the discount window, its facilities, and recommendations for depository institutions on how to prepare to borrow from the Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Reserve System has made important investments to enhance the technology that supports discount window activities. Earlier this year, the System launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to request and prepay loans as well as securely message their local Reserve Bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Discount Window Direct generally is accessible 24 hours a day. We are actively encouraging the use of Discount Window Direct.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking Feedback on the Discount Window</strong><br />To complement our efforts to enhance discount window operations, the Federal Reserve Board recently announced that it is collecting feedback from the public on operational frictions associated with the discount window and intraday credit through the issuance of a request for information. As some of you may know, a request for information is a formal document through which a government agency solicits feedback. Members of the public can submit comments in response to the request for information until December 9, 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a></p>
<p>The Board requests input on various discount window and intraday credit operational practices, such as the process for requesting, receiving, and repaying discount window loans as well as Reserve Bank discount window and intraday credit communications practices. Through the request for information, the Board hopes to gain further insight into the operational aspects that are the most costly or burdensome for depository institutions. This will help the Fed consider further improvements to promote efficiency and reduce burden on depository institutions. Ultimately, the Fed's goal is to build on the current discount window operations and processes so that the discount window will continue to provide ready access to funding against a wide range of collateral in the future. I encourage members of the public to submit comments on the request for information, and I look forward to considering the feedback that we receive.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />Before concluding, let me share with you a summary of my outlook for the U.S. economy, as I did yesterday with the audience at Davidson. Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Jefferson (2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For more details about this period, see Clouse (1994). In response to the wave of depository institution failures, Congress placed legal limitations on Federal Reserve lending to troubled institutions. Specifically, section 142 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) amended section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act to place restraints on discount window lending to undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized insured depository institutions. FDICIA also imposed liability on the Board of Governors for excess losses incurred by the FDIC that are attributable to lending beyond those limits. The provisions of FDICIA were intended to reduce moral hazard in the banking system and limit taxpayer losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For more details, see the October 31, 2002, Federal Reserve press release (Board of Governors, 2002b) and the final rule implementing the changes (Board of Governors, 2002a).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In 2003, when primary credit was implemented, there was a single federal funds target rate. The Federal Open Market Committee adopted a federal funds target range on December 16, 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For details on the change to the rate spread announced in March 2020, see the press release (Board of Governors, 2020). As will be discussed in greater detail later, before 2020, the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate (or top of the target range) had changed a few times to address economic conditions during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. This design feature also would help Reserve Banks manage risk more easily by establishing a standardized approach and risk controls when lending through a facility reserved for troubled depository institutions. Loans to troubled depository institutions entail more risk to the lending Reserve Bank, and depository institutions that are undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized are subject to lending limitations under FDICIA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. See Artu&ccedil; and Demiralp (2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See Bernanke (2009a) and Madigan (2009) for a retrospective that elaborates on some of the emergency measures taken during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the reasoning for discount window rate changes during the financial crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Throughout this crisis, the Board approved numerous reductions in the primary credit rate and narrowed the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate twice. With the narrowing of the spread in August 2007 from 100 basis points to 50 basis points and in March 2008 to 25 basis points, the Board announced that the maximum term for primary credit loans would be extended, first to 30 days and then to 90 days, respectively. As economic conditions improved, in 2010, the Board increased the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate to 50 basis points and shortened the maximum term for primary credit loans to overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. The TAF provided fixed quantities of term credit to depository institutions through an auction mechanism and seemed to have largely addressed banks' concern that borrowing from the Federal Reserve would imply weakness. According to Bernanke (2009b, paragraph 7), this was "partly because the sizable number of borrowers provides a greater assurance of anonymity, and possibly also because the three-day period between the auction and auction settlement suggests that the facility's users are not using it to meet acute funding needs on a particular day."&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. See section 1103 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41">Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks</a>," is published weekly. It presents a balance sheet for each Federal Reserve Bank, a consolidated balance sheet for all 12 Reserve Banks, an associated statement that lists the factors affecting reserve balances of depository institutions, and several other tables presenting information on the assets, liabilities, and commitments of the Federal Reserve Banks. For additional details on the consolidation of "loans" into a broader category of assets, see the March 19, 2020, H.4.1 announcement, available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319/">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. As with the discount window, an eligible institution participated in the BTFP through its local Reserve Bank. The legal agreements and process for pledging securities in the BTFP also relied on those used in discount window lending. Nevertheless, the BTFP differed from the discount window in various ways, including the term of lending, scope of eligible collateral, collateral valuation, and interest rate. For more information on the differences between the BTFP and the discount window, see the response to question A.3 in Board of Governors (2024a, p. 3).

<div> Report, Investor Education, Crypto-Assets, Risks, Regulation
<br />
IOSCO released a report on crypto-asset investor education. It highlights risks, regulatory changes, and the need for financial literacy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>IOSCO is pleased to release its Final Report on Investor Education surrounding Crypto-Assets. This Report summarizes the results of a survey distributed to members of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee for Retail Investors (C8) in autumn last year about retail investor behaviour, demographics, and experiences with crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Crypto-assets have been a key priority for IOSCO for some time and in 2022 it established a Board-level FinTech Task Force to develop, oversee, deliver and implement IOSCO&rsquo;s work with respect to FinTech and crypto-assets. Early work has shown that investors are drawn to invest in crypto-assets for three key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of missing out&rdquo;      (&ldquo;FOMO&rdquo;) or as a speculative investment;</li>
<li>Low cost of entry; and</li>
<li>Advice from friends      and/or social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD769.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917581430%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0LGr%2FUUPTFWUWuvBLJfCCSztwgdjVWxYIWvxS%2FIPvug%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Final Report</a> highlights examples of regulatory changes and enforcement activity by C8 members since the <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD668.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917610936%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=PiFrAW5%2B2uHm6z6G9UO6%2BqDc%2BXU7p2pA0C7tjbdiXEQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">related 2020 report</a>, as well as current priority issues around investor education in the crypto-asset space, such as relationship investment scams and the need to communicate with retail investors on, and about, social media.</p>
<p>The Report suggests specific investor education messages which C8 members could consider when driving forward education of crypto-assets in their local jurisdiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Investments in crypto-assets can be      exceptionally risky and these assets are often volatile.</em></li>
<li><em>Investors should be wary of investments      promoted on social media and use skepticism when following &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>Crypto-asset investments might lack basic      investor protections, as those offering crypto-asset investments or      services may not be complying with applicable law, including registration      and licensing requirements.</em></li>
<li><em>Investments offered in compliance with a      jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory framework confers investors with certain      investor protections.</em></li>
<li><em>Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising      popularity of crypto-assets to lure retail investors into scams, often      leading to devastating losses.</em></li>
<li><em>Understanding the nature of investing      generally, including having an investing plan, and understanding risk      tolerance and time horizon, as well as understanding the nature of      investing in crypto-assets, can be critical to overall and long-term      investing success.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO, commented: &ldquo;<em>With such growing widespread interest in crypto-assets, retail investors are subject to unique risks. Market events have shown that the industry carries high levels of volatility, failures, and bad actors causing harm to investors and the markets.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is not surprising, therefore, that crypto-asset education is one of IOSCO&rsquo;s top priorities and forms a big part of this year&rsquo;s World Investor Week, which highlights a number of common challenges that we all face as financial regulators and as financial consumers.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking place over the course of this week, IOSCO&rsquo;s annual World Investor Week is a platform to promote financial education and literacy. <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldinvestorweek.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917627842%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=htx%2F5VgIUb3S92SUDfTE%2F%2F%2FYCzuCRQ58uUsC%2Fypzcek%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Servais added: &ldquo;<em>Financial education is a complementary tool to regulation and supervision to enhance investors&rsquo; awareness, critical sense and rational behaviour. Financial literacy must go hand in hand with appropriate investor protection measures, fair advice, supervision and enforcement of rules.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<div> Eventus, Bitnomial, trade surveillance, financial risk, Bitnomial Exchange<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus and Bitnomial announce partnership for trade surveillance. Bitnomial selects Eventus Validus platform to enhance market surveillance capabilities. Bitnomial Exchange sees record growth. <br />Summary:<br /> <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions,&nbsp;and Bitnomial, Inc. a digital asset derivatives exchange company that operates CFTC regulated exchange, clearinghouse and settlement businesses, today announced that Bitnomial Exchange has selected the Eventus Validus platform for all of its trade surveillance needs. Bitnomial sought a comprehensive, scalable trade surveillance solution as the firm has grown extensively and expanded into new products and business lines.</p>
<p>Bitnomial and Eventus have had a strategic partnership since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">May 2021</span>, when Eventus began providing seamless integration of order and execution flow on behalf of two large futures commission merchant (FCM) clients that are members of the exchange. Bitnomial Exchange's decision to deploy Validus followed a review of both internal trade surveillance capabilities and the offerings of Eventus and other external providers as the exchange decided how best to build on its internal surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Michael Dunn</span>, President of Bitnomial Exchange, commented on the news: "We are thrilled to adopt Eventus' Validus platform to enhance our market surveillance capabilities. This partnership builds on our years of collaboration to support our mutual customers and deliver a secure, transparent and highly efficient trading experience. Integrating Eventus' advanced surveillance tools with our proprietary, in-house surveillance system strengthens our commitment to compliance and transparency, while reinforcing the trust our clients place in Bitnomial Exchange."</p>
<p>Eventus CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Travis Schwab</span>&nbsp;said: "Bitnomial continues to see phenomenal growth as an exchange business that can meet the needs of the most discerning institutional investors. Our extensive experience in digital assets globally, combined with internal markets and regulatory expertise and a best-of-breed solution, all played a role in this selection. We're excited to build on our relationship and serve as a trusted partner supporting Bitnomial's continued growth and the integrity of its markets."</p>
<p>In August, Bitnomial Exchange announced record growth for the quarter ending on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">June 30</span>&nbsp;and over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$130 million</span>&nbsp;in notional value traded during the first half of 2024, representing a 1,081% increase during the same period in 2023. The&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>-based exchange offering physically settled&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;futures and options was founded in 2014 to provide a regulated, secure environment for institutional and professional traders to participate in&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;derivatives markets. Late last year, the CFTC approved Bitnomial's clearinghouse, and the exchange recently introduced Hashrate futures in partnership with Luxor targeting&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;miners.</p>

<div> technology, ISDA Ops, risk management, automation, Validus<br />
Summary:<br />
Validus introduces ISDA Ops for automated ISDA ATE and CSA Threshold calculation, real-time risk management, enhanced reporting, scenario analytics, and integration with existing platforms. <div>
<p>Validus Risk Management (&lsquo;Validus&rsquo;), a leading independent financial risk advisory and technology firm, has introduced ISDA Ops, a groundbreaking solution aimed at automating the calculation and monitoring of complex ISDA Additional Termination Events (ATEs) and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) Thresholds.</p>
<p>The solution provides an intelligent and scalable approach to constructing ATE and CSA Threshold conditions. The new platform significantly enhances efficiency by simplifying the management of ISDA and CSA terms, offering a streamlined approach for handling counterparty and liquidity risks.</p>
<p>The complexity of monitoring ATEs and CSA Thresholds has historically presented significant challenges for financial institutions. Using Validus&rsquo; proprietary technology, ISDA Ops was developed taking into consideration over 2,000 trading lines across more than 40 major counterparties, providing a monitoring platform, which allows users to analyse and test conditions using live and forecasted data. The tailor-made design of the Expression Builder provides complete flexibility, allowing full customisation and accommodating all possible terms. ISDA Ops empowers real-time proactive decision-making, enabling firms to manage collateral requirements and counterparty risk more effectively.</p>
<p>Key benefits of ISDA Ops include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Automated Tracking and Calculation:</b>&nbsp;ISDA Ops provides automatic calculation and tracking of ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds across all counterparties, ensuring seamless risk management.</li>
<li><b>Real-Time Risk Management:</b>&nbsp;Users can proactively make decisions in real time, significantly improving the management of counterparty and liquidity risks by identifying potential collateral calls early.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Reporting:</b>&nbsp;The platform provides intelligent reporting tools that simplify the process of tracking and updating ISDA terms, boosting transparency.</li>
<li><b>Scenario Analytics:</b>&nbsp;With the ability to test conditions using both live and forecasted data, ISDA Ops enable users to simulate potential future scenarios and proactively address potential risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ISDA Ops integrates with Validus&rsquo; Horizon platform, including RiskView, a configurable hedging monitoring and reporting framework, TradeView, a front-office hedging platform, and PortfolioView, a portfolio-level risk management platform. The new features enable&nbsp;CSA Thresholds to be updated and monitored within RiskView, proactively identifying potential collateral calls, while PortfolioView data is integrated for condition testing.</p>
<p><b>Alain Smith, Head of Client Engagement at Validus Risk Management, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Monitoring and managing ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds are crucial risk management functions but has historically proven a major challenge due to the scale and complexity of the task. ISDA Ops therefore represents a significant breakthrough for risk management teams &ndash; presenting a clear, consolidated view of the data and allowing users to identify breaches and model for future risks. Cutting-edge technology has made processing huge volumes of data possible, looking to the future our aim is to keep ISDA Ops at the forefront &ndash; deploying generative AI to deepen the capabilities of our game-changing solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Validus is scheduled to deliver further enhancements to ISDA Ops before the end of the year, using generative AI to efficiently parse complex language, scale the offering and drive faster data retrieval. The launch follows the announcement in June that Validus delivered several upgrades to TradeView, enabling automation pre-trade checks.</p>

</ul>
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, has published the results of its annual country classification review for countries monitored by its global equity and fixed income indices.</p>
<h4><span>Fixed Income</span></h4>
<p>FTSE Russell is pleased to announce that&nbsp;<span>South Korea</span>&nbsp;will be reclassified from Market Accessibility 1 to 2, and South Korean government bonds will be added to the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI), effective with November 2025 index profiles and phased in over a one-year period on a quarterly basis. Since being placed on the Watch List in September 2022, several initiatives intended to improve the accessibility of South Korean government bonds for international investors have been implemented by market authorities. Most recently, these efforts have facilitated connectivity with International Central Securities Depositaries in June 2024 for the South Korean bond market and permitted third-party foreign exchange for South Korean won starting in July 2024. Following this confirmatory announcement regarding index inclusion, FTSE Russell encourages global financial market infrastructure providers to continue their readiness activities to support future investment in the South Korean government bond market by WGBI users and leverage the benefits of the market structure reforms. FTSE Russell continues to welcome feedback from index stakeholders on such process to ensure a frictionless inclusion of the South Korea government bond market in the WGBI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nikki Stefanelli, Head of Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Index Policy at FTSE Russell, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We congratulate South Korean market authorities on their efforts to expand and encourage global investment in their local government bond market. FTSE Russell have closely monitored the capital markets reforms that have been implemented by South Korean market authorities over the past two years and their effectiveness in achieving the rigorous accessibility criteria for WGBI inclusion. We look forward to continuing to support the market as it undertakes readiness activities ahead of index inclusion at the end of next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mr. Sang-mok Choi, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Korea comments:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Over the last two years, the South Korean government has announced a series of initiatives to strengthen its capital markets for both domestic and international investors, which have now been successfully implemented. Over this time, we have had a positive engagement with FTSE Russell and international market participants on the impact of these efforts and their ability to facilitate inclusion of South Korean government bonds in the FTSE WGBI, which requires the highest level of market accessibility. We are pleased with the process, and more importantly the outcome with FTSE Russell&rsquo;s decision today.&nbsp; The MOEF are committed to continuing and strengthening its engagement with market participants to ensure a smooth index inclusion starting in November 2025, which will bring a welcomed increase in international investment in our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTSE Russell announces that the Market Accessibility Level for&nbsp;<span>India&nbsp;</span>will be reclassified from 0 to 1, and Indian government bonds will be included in the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI), starting in September 2025. This decision reflects the continued progress in the accessibility of the market for these securities for international investors and the growing importance of the Indian government bond market in mainstream global emerging markets bond portfolios. FTSE Russell thanks the Reserve Bank of India for its continued dialogue and commitment to facilitating international investment in its local market.</p>
<h4><span>Price source change to Tradeweb FTSE closing prices for the US, Eurozone and UK government markets</span></h4>
<p>FTSE Russell are pleased to announce a price source change for US Treasuries, European government bonds and UK Gilts to Tradeweb FTSE Closing Prices, effective March 2025. The change will be effective across all FTSE global fixed income indices, including the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Tradeweb FTSE closing bond prices are based on bid-side and offer-side price quotes supplied by market makers to Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic trading platform for institutional dealer and clients during a pre-determined collection window each day. The closing prices, which are derived from these quotes, offer index users a more representative, transparent and robust approach to valuing fixed income securities. In its role as benchmark administrator for these closing prices, FTSE Russell is in a unique position to ensure they are calculated in line with its rigorous governance standards.&nbsp;</p>

<title>A History Of The Fed's Discount Window: 1913–2000, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip N. Jefferson, At Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hicks and Tara Boehmler, for the kind introduction.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected, including those in the Davidson College family. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>I am happy to be back at Davidson College. This is a special community. I am bound to it by a shared experience defined not by its length, but by its intensity. As I visited with you today, and as I look around this hall, I see the faces of colleagues who became dear friends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, we spoke often about the unprecedented uncertainty we faced. Amidst that uncertainty, however, we supported each other on this campus. Now, looking back, we can attest that this mutual support was vital. I am grateful to have been amongst you during that unprecedented time. Today, I am proud to see that Davidson is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>I am excited to be here with you this evening and to talk to you about the history of the Federal Reserve's discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The discount window is one of the tools the Fed uses to support the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and to implement monetary policy effectively. It was created in 1913 when the Fed was established. Today, more than 110 years later, this tool continues to play an important role. At the Fed, we always look for ways to improve our tools, including our discount window operations. Recently, the Fed published a request for information document to receive feedback from the public regarding operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Today, I will do three things. First, I will discuss briefly my outlook for the U.S. economy. Second, I will offer my historical perspective on the discount window, starting in 1913 and ending in 2000. Finally, I will provide a few details about the request for information the Fed recently published.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will say more about the discount window when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide3.png" id="fig3">slide 3</a>, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. A shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide4.png" id="fig4">slide 4</a>, the unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide5.png" id="fig5">slide 5</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p><strong>Discount Window History</strong><br /><em>1913: The Fed was established</em><br />Now, I will turn to my perspective on the history of the discount window. Understanding this history is important as we consider ways to ensure the discount window continues to serve effectively in its critical role of providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve.</p>
<p>Before the Federal Reserve was founded, the U.S. experienced frequent financial panics. One example is illustrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide6.png" id="fig6">slide 6</a>&nbsp;with a newspaper clipping from the Rocky Mountain Times printed on July 19, 1893. It depicts panic swirling against banks at a time when bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. The illustration shows how waves of panic hit public confidence, the rocks in the picture, and how banks have a fortress mentality. They stand strong against the panic, but they are not lending, and they are isolated.</p>
<p>Back then, the supply of money to the economy was inelastic in the short term, in part because the monetary system in the U.S. was based on the gold standard. Demand for cash, however, varied over the course of the year and was particularly strong during harvest season, when crops were brought to the market. The surge in demand for cash, combined with the inelastic supply of money in the short term, caused financial conditions to tighten seasonally. The banking system was fairly good at moving money to where it needed to go, but it had little scope to expand the total amount of money available in response to the U.S. economy's needs. So if a shock hit the economy when financial conditions were already tight, then the banking system struggled to provide the extra liquidity needed. Banks would seek to preserve liquidity by reducing their investments and denying loan requests, for example. Depositors, fearful that they might not be able to access their funds when they needed them, would rush to withdraw their money. Of course, that caused the banks to conserve further on liquidity. In some cases, they simply closed their doors until the storm passed. When banks closed their doors, economic activity would contract.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Activity would recover when the banks reopened, but the economic suffering in the meantime was meaningful.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply of money in the economy being inelastic in the short term, two prominent frictions, asymmetric information and externalities, made banks and private markets vulnerable to systemic crises. Here, asymmetric information refers to the fact that customers do not have access to all the information they need to evaluate whether a bank is insolvent, illiquid, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, customers rely on imperfect signals, such as news reports about another bank failing, to decide whether to withdraw their money from their own bank.</p>
<p>Then there are externalities, in the sense that an individual bank may not consider how an innocent bystander may be negatively impacted by its actions. When a financial institution fails, that may lead depositors to withdraw money from other unrelated banks, which may in turn cause those banks to fail. Contagion can transform a single bank failure into a systemic crisis, where many banks fail, credit evaporates, the stock market collapses, the economy enters a recession, and the unemployment rate increases dramatically.</p>
<p>The severe financial panic of 1907 stands out as an example of market failure due to these two prominent frictions. The panic was triggered by a series of bad banking decisions that led to a frenzy of withdrawals caused by asymmetric information and public distrust in the liquidity of the banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Banks in many large cities, including financial centers such as New York and Chicago, simply stopped sending payments outside of their communities. The resulting disruption in the payment system and to the flow of liquidity through the banking system led to a severe, though short-lived, economic contraction. This experience led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This act created the Federal Reserve System, composed of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In 1913, the main monetary policy tool at the Fed's disposal was the discount window. At that time, the Fed did not use open market operations&mdash;the buying and selling of government securities in the open market&mdash;to conduct monetary policy. Instead, the Fed adjusted the money supply by lending directly to banks that needed funds through the discount window. The Fed's ability to provide funds to banks as needed made the money supply of the U.S. more elastic and considerably reduced the seasonal volatility in interest rates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This ability also enabled the Fed to provide stability in times of stress, helping banks that experienced rapid withdrawals to satisfy their customers' demand for liquidity and thereby potentially preventing banking panics.</p>
<p><em>1920s: The Fed began to discourage strongly use of the discount window</em><br />In fact, many researchers have argued that the existence of the Fed's discount window prevented a financial crisis in the early 1920s, when the banking sector came under pressure as the U.S. economy transitioned to a peacetime economy following the end of World War I.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;There had been an agricultural boom during the war and a significant accumulation of debt within that sector. Farmers came under pressure as the prices of agricultural goods dropped from wartime highs. The banks sought to support their customers, and the Fed sought to support the banks. There were serious concerns about the condition of several banks in parts of the country. The Fed's discount window lending provided critical support that saved many banks but also resulted in habitual use of the discount window by some banks during the 1920s.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide7.png" id="fig7">Slide 7</a>&nbsp;shows that as of August 1925, 593 member banks, 6 percent of the total, had been borrowing for a year or more from Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, there were real solvency problems, and several banks failed with discount window loans outstanding. These challenges resulted in the Fed strongly discouraging banks from continuous borrowing from the discount window and the adoption of a policy of encouraging a "reluctance to borrow."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>By 1926, the Fed was explicit that borrowing at the discount window was meant to be short term. As I emphasize in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide8.png" id="fig8">slide 8</a>, the Federal Reserve's annual report for 1926 stated that while continuous borrowing by a member bank may be necessary, depending on local economic conditions, "the funds of the Federal reserve banks are primarily intended to be used in meeting the seasonal and temporary requirements of members, and continuous borrowing by a member bank as a general practice would not be consistent with the intent of the Federal reserve act."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>The late 1920s also highlighted Fed concerns about the purpose of the borrowing. The Fed sought to distinguish between "speculative security loans" and loans for "legitimate business."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;A staff reappraisal of the discount mechanism stated that "[t]he controversy over direct pressure intensified in the latter part of the 1920s as an increasing flow of bank credit went into the stock market."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;In short, the Fed observed that some banks were becoming habitual borrowers from the discount window. It was concerned that an overreliance on discount window borrowings would weaken banks and make them more prone to failure.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, the Fed switched to open market operations as its primary tool for conducting monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That allowed the Fed to determine the aggregate amount of liquidity in the system and to rely on private financial markets to distribute it efficiently. The discount window would thus serve as a safety valve if there was a shock that caused conditions to tighten unexpectedly or if individual banks experienced idiosyncratic shocks or somehow lost access to interbank markets.</p>
<p>The intention of this set-up was for banks to use the discount window to borrow from the Fed only occasionally. Ordinarily and predominantly, financial institutions were supposed to rely on private markets for their funding. This set-up was designed to limit moral hazard&mdash;the possibility that institutions take unnecessary risks when there is no market discipline. This is the key balancing act. The Fed needs to be a reliable backstop to prevent financial crises, but it also needs to minimize moral hazard that comes from always standing ready to provide support.</p>
<p><em>1930s&ndash;1940s: The Great Depression and WWII</em><br />During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the banking system experienced severe stress, including many bank runs. There are many reasons why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems in the banking system in the 1930s. I will highlight only two. First, many banks were insolvent rather than illiquid. Central bank lending is not a fundamental solution in those circumstances. When banks are insolvent, it is important to manage the closure in as orderly a manner as possible. The establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 gave bank regulators increased ability to do that. Relatedly, the challenging experiences of lending to troubled banks in the 1920s likely made the Fed more reluctant to lend in circumstances in which solvency concerns were material. Second, the types of collateral that the Fed was initially able to accept when lending to banks were quite limited.</p>
<p>In response, in the early 1930s Congress expanded the range of banking assets that could serve as collateral for discount window loans and added a variety of new Fed emergency lending authorities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;These new lending authorities were used in the 1930s to help alleviate distress. Some were also used in the early 1940s as the Fed helped support the World War II mobilization effort.</p>
<p>The period following the war was relatively calm. The role of the discount window shifted from addressing distress in the banking system to acting as a safety valve to manage tightness in money markets and support monetary policy operations.</p>
<p><em>1950&ndash;2000: Measures to discourage discount window borrowing</em><br />In March 1951, the U.S. Treasury and the Fed reached an agreement to separate government debt management from the conduct of monetary policy, thereby laying the foundation for the modern Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s, the Fed set the interest rate on discount window loans above market rates. Thus, it served as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate. The Fed continued to discourage extensive use of the discount window, but the relatively high interest rate also made its sustained use less attractive.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the Fed placed greater emphasis on open market operations to set its monetary policy stance. Concurrently, the Fed shifted to a policy of setting the interest rate on discount window loans below the market rates. Because the interest rate no longer deterred use of the window, the Fed turned increasingly to other measures, such as administrative pressures and moral suasion, to limit the frequency with which banks requested loans from the discount window. Indeed, between the late 1920s and the 1980s, the Fed adopted and amended numerous restrictions on discount window borrowing. Whenever discount window usage increased too much, the Fed tightened the restrictions to suppress borrowing.</p>
<p>For example, in the 1950s, the Fed defined appropriate and inappropriate discount window borrowing. In particular, the Board's regulations in 1955 stated that "[u]nder ordinary conditions, the continuous use of Federal Reserve credit by a member bank over a considerable period of time is not regarded as appropriate" and provided more details on how Reserve Banks should evaluate the "purpose" of a credit request.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;By 1973, the Board had made additional changes to its regulations on discount window use and defined three distinct discount window programs: adjustment credit, intended to help depository institutions meet short-term liquidity needs; seasonal credit, intended to help small depository institutions manage liquidity needs that arise from seasonal swings in loans and deposits; and extended credit, intended to help depository institutions that have somewhat longer-term liquidity needs resulting from exceptional circumstances.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Over time, the Board added provisions in its regulations requiring banks to exhaust other sources of funding before using discount window credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in the early 1980s, the Fed levied a surcharge on frequent borrowings by large banks to augment the administrative restrictions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Despite these policies to discourage use of the discount window,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide9.png" id="fig9">slide 9</a>&nbsp;shows that discount window borrowing, adjusted for the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, was notable in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting that the discount window was an important marginal source of funding for banks during that period.</p>
<p>That changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when there were notable solvency problems in the banking industry. During this period, the discount window provided support to troubled institutions, while the FDIC sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the failure of these institutions in an orderly manner. The discount window activity that took place while FDIC resolutions proceeded increased the association between use of the discount window and being a troubled institution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;As a result, banks became more reluctant to borrow from the discount window. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective, both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool. That resulted in a series of efforts by the Fed in the early 2000s to change how the discount window operates. Tomorrow, I will discuss those efforts when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><em>A request for information</em><br />Before closing, I'd like to return to where I began. Understanding the history of the discount window is important as we consider ways to ensure it continues to serve effectively in its critical role in providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve. One way to ensure it continues to serve effectively is to collect feedback from the public.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide10.png" id="fig10">Slide 10</a>&nbsp;provides some touch points on the Board's request for information document. The request for information seeks feedback from the public on a range of operational practices for the discount window and intraday credit, including the collection of legal documents; the process for pledging and withdrawing collateral; the process for requesting, receiving and repaying discount window advances; the extension of intraday credit; and Reserve Bank communications practices. My colleagues and I are looking forward to this feedback to inform potential future enhancements to discount window operations. The period for responding to our request for information ends on December 9, 2024.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The discount window is a monetary policy facility where depository institutions can request to borrow money against collateral from the Fed. The term "window" originates with the now obsolete practice of sending a bank representative to a Reserve Bank physical teller window when a bank needed to borrow money. The term "discount" refers to how depository institutions borrow money on a discount basis&mdash;interest amount for the entire loan period (plus other charges, if any) is deducted from the principal at the time a loan is disbursed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The Federal Reserve provides intraday credit to depository institutions to foster a safe and efficient payment system. For more information on intraday credit and the Board's Payment System Risk policy, see "Payment System Risk" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. See, for example, Goodhart (1988).</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Illiquidity is a short-term cash flow problem. An illiquid bank cannot pay its current obligations, such as deposit withdrawals, even though the value of the bank's assets exceeds the value of its liabilities. In other words, illiquidity means the bank does not currently have the resources to meet its current obligations. With a short-term loan, an illiquid bank would be able to pay its obligations. Insolvency is a long-term balance sheet problem. Total obligations of an insolvent bank are larger than its total assets. A short-term loan would not help an insolvent bank. Of course, evaluating the quality of a bank's loan book in real time to determine whether a bank is solvent can be extremely challenging during a crisis. In addition, in some cases, illiquidity caused by large deposit withdrawals can lead banks to sell assets at fire-sale prices that then impairs their solvency. Conversely, concerns about insolvency, even if unfounded, can lead to liquidity problems. In the bank run literature, the connections between liquidity and solvency are a key factor that gives rise to runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The panic of 1907 started in October 1907 when three brothers&mdash;F. Augustus Heinze, Otto Heinze, and Arthur P. Heinze&mdash;as well as Charles W. Morse attempted to manipulate the price of United Copper stock by purchasing a large number of shares of the company. Their plan failed, and the stock price of United Copper collapsed. The collapse led to depositor runs on banks and trust companies associated with the Heinzes and Morse. This included a run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose president was connected to Morse. The Knickerbocker Trust Company failed, and the New York Stock Exchange fell nearly 50 percent from its peak of the previous year in the wake of the failure. See Terrell (2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. To aid its thinking on reforming the monetary system, Congress established the National Monetary Commission. The landmark 24 volume report from the commission provides a rich review of the operations of central banks in other countries, a history of financial crises in the U.S., and an appraisal of the state of the contemporary banking system in the U.S. at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See Miron (1986).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. See, for example, Gorton (1988). Willis (1923) and Board of Governors (1922) also suggest that the Fed prevented a crisis from happening in 1920.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. See Carlson (forthcoming).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. See Shull (1971, pp. 33&ndash;34).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. See Board of Governors (1927, p. 4). In 1926, approximately one-third of all banks in the U.S. were member banks, holding about 60 percent of the total loans and investments for all banks; see Board of Governors (1926). Banks receiving charters from the federal government were required to become members of the Federal Reserve System while banks receiving charters from state governments had the option to become members. Discount window borrowing was originally limited to Federal Reserve System member banks. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 opened the window to all depository institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. See Gorton and Metrick (2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. See Anderson (1971, p. 137). In the statement, "direct pressure" refers to the Fed policy of pressuring banks not to borrow from the window. Congress may have shared some of those concerns, as the Federal Reserve Act was amended in 1933 to include a passage in section 4 requiring Reserve Banks to be careful about speculative uses of the Federal Reserve credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. Open market operations are the purchase or sale of securities (for example, U.S. Treasury bonds) in the open market by the Fed. In modern times, the short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the FOMC. For more information, please refer to "Open Market Operations" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. There are several banking acts that do this, but especially the Banking Act of 1932, the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, and the Banking Act of 1935. Yet one more reason why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems of the banking system in the 1930s is that, during this period, nonmember banks did not have access to the discount window. These banks suffered the most during the Great Depression. The ability of nonmember banks to access the window only changed in 1980 with the Monetary Control Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. After the U.S. entered World War II, the Federal Reserve supported efforts by the Treasury to hold down the cost of financing the war by establishing caps on interest rates on Treasury securities (see, for instance, Meltzer, 2003, Chapter 7). The cap pertaining to longer-term interest rates continued to be in place until the 1951 agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. By 1980, the Board's regulations stated that adjustment credit "generally is available only after reasonable alternative sources of funds, including credit from special industry lenders, such as Federal Home Loan Banks, the National Credit Union Administration's Central Liquidity Facility, and corporate central credit unions have been fully used"; seasonal credit was "available only if similar assistance is not available from other special industry lenders"; and other extended credit was available only "where similar assistance is not reasonably available from other sources, including special industry lenders"; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr045/fr045159/fr045159.pdf">Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 45 Fed.

<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. A congressional inquiry found that this lending likely increased losses to the deposit insurance funds at the time and led to limitations on the ability of the Federal Reserve to provide loans to troubled depository institutions as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group (RCG) for the Americas met on 7 and 8 October in Santiago. The meeting was hosted by the Central Bank of Chile and the Financial Market Commission. FSB Chair, Klaas Knot, joined RCG members for the meeting.</p>
<p>On the first day, members took part in a workshop on macroprudential frameworks and discussed the interaction between micro and macroprudential policies and the institutional arrangements needed for their consistent and effective implementation. Members stressed the importance of coordination and collaboration between financial authorities to respond to financial risks in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>On the second day, members discussed recent developments and shared their thoughts on vulnerabilities they were monitoring in their jurisdictions, including heightened volatility and asset repricing risks. Members exchanged views on potential implications of recent monetary easing on capital flows and exchange rates in the region. Severe weather events have increased in frequency and intensity in the Americas. The group discussed the availability and affordability of climate and natural catastrophe insurance in the region, and implications for financial stability. Members discussed their work to strengthen the reliability and comparability of climate-related financial disclosures and to incorporate climate-related risks into their supervisory frameworks.</p>
<p>Digital innovation in payments has the potential to boost the provision of &ndash; and access to &ndash; finance in the region. Such innovation could help meet the goals of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/">G20&rsquo;s Roadmap</a>&nbsp;for cheaper, faster, more accessible and transparent cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. Members notably discussed issues and developments related to open finance, fast payment systems, central bank digital currencies and crypto-assets, and challenges in fostering digital innovation in payments. Members noted the importance of the FSB&rsquo;s work to promote greater alignment and interoperability in these frameworks within and across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Recent operational incidents, such as the CrowdStrike failure, illustrate the risks from financial institutions&rsquo; reliance on third-party providers. Members discussed their progress in implementing the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">toolkit</a>&nbsp;to help financial institutions to monitor, identify and manage risks arising from third-party services and work to strengthen their cyber resilience. Members acknowledged the FSB&rsquo;s efforts in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/recommendations-to-achieve-greater-convergence-in-cyber-incident-reporting-final-report/">promoting greater convergence in cyber incident reporting</a>&nbsp;and looked forward to participating in the upcoming consultation on a format for incident reporting exchange.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Americas is co-chaired by Kenneth Baker, Managing Director and CEO, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada.

<div> DSB, Technology Advisory Committee, OTC derivatives, application deadline, governance<br />
Summary:<br />
DSB's TAC welcomes new applicants for a two-year term. It provides technical stewardship, advises on industry consultation topics, and shapes DSB's technology roadmap. <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today announced that the DSB&rsquo;s Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter is&nbsp;</span><span>welcoming new applicants&nbsp;</span><span>ahead of a new two (2) year term</span><span>, with an application deadline of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>23rd October.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Established in 2018, the TAC provides advisory support to the DSB in recognition of required enhancements and adaptations to its technology base and services. Working alongside the DSB Product and Governance Advisory Committees, the TAC is responsible for the technical stewardship ensuring the DSB technology strategy is aligned with the needs of the markets it serves, including making recommendations to the DSB Board&nbsp;</span>on technology-related DSB industry consultation topics.<br /><br />The TAC is composed of representatives from DSB user organisations, independent experts and regulatory observers within the wider OTC derivatives community and its remit includes matters relating to both the OTC International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) Services.&nbsp;The DSB invites applications from OTC-derivatives technology practitioners from across all jurisdictions and institutional types to contribute to DSB technical governance and development.</span></p>
<p><span>During previous charter terms, the TAC has focused on the DSB&rsquo;s resiliency, including the DSB&rsquo;s disaster recovery arrangements. A key development is the addition of a second &ldquo;as-production&rdquo; UAT environment, introduced to assist users with regression testing of their own IT changes against the DSB. The TAC has also launched specialist subcommittees with the Global Agile Architecture subcommittee having recently overseen the migration of&nbsp;<span>the DSB&rsquo;s infrastructure to&nbsp;</span><span>a globally distributed data repository covering multiple locations in Europe and North America.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Andy Hughes, a member of the DSB Management Team and DDO of the TAC,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;The collaboration with the TAC over the last charter term&nbsp;</span><span>which helped shape UPI implementation and its integration into the OTC ISIN Service</span><span>. This continued collaboration with the TAC members will be essential during this next charter term as the DSB expands into further global jurisdictional regions and adapts to changes in digital operations."<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB&nbsp;</strong>added<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The TAC is instrumental in shaping the DSB technology roadmap. The technical expertise of the TAC continues to play a key part in the evolution of our services. The work of the DSB industry representation groups is highly valued and designed to ensure that all developments continue to best serve industry requirements.&rdquo;</span></p>

Derivatives traded volume achieved single-day records over two consecutive days during the month, reaching as high as 3.46 million contracts across equities, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities on 25 September.</p>
<p>Key highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Highlights:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities unique to market-based finance explain why we delivered the most significant reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets in a generation.</li>
<li>Our review of the financial advice and guidance boundary aims to unlock innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs.</li>
<li>We will continue to collaborate as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether in London, in Brussels, Hong Kong or New York, the same discussion is underway: how do we maximise the ability of sustainable, vibrant capital markets to drive greater volumes of investment into the real economy?</p>
<p>That question &ndash; asked by policymakers and industry alike &ndash; is why we brought you all here today and I want to thank all the speakers who have made this conference such a success.</p>
<p>I know that many of you, like me, have had whole careers dedicated to capital markets during an era where globalisation drove a remarkable surge of cross-border investment flows. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>UK equity markets reforms</h2>
<p>I started my career as one of a vast number of very junior lawyers who worked on the UK&rsquo;s gas, water, electricity and telecoms privatisations of the '80s, amid the huge changes brought about by the financial services 'big bang'.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in the astounding development of China&rsquo;s international equity and bond markets. And not long ago I led the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global regulatory standard setter for securities markets.</p>
<p>I have seen first-hand how capital markets can work well. How they can drive business &ndash; with factories built, shops opened, goods delivered, people employed; how they can support long-term risk taking to deliver more secure retirements for millions of people; and how they can spur wider economic growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen how market fragmentation and de-globalisation can stall cross-border capital formation.</p>
<p>But it's the opportunities that are unique to market-based finance which explain why the FCA has just delivered the most significant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-overhauls-listing-rules-boost-growth-and-innovation-uk-stock-markets" title="FCA overhauls listing rules to boost growth and innovation on UK stock markets">reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets</a>&nbsp;in a generation.</p>
<p>These reforms are already having an impact, ensuring that more businesses can get into the shop window. But the harder task is to more effectively mobilise the domestic savings necessary to grow these businesses.</p>
<p>When we talk about listings regimes, stamp duty, accounting rules, or even initial public offerings (IPO&rsquo;s), those outside this room could be forgiven for thinking we&rsquo;re speaking in a foreign language, switching off as a result, unsure how any of it matters to them.</p>
<p>So, we need to make a case for it to matter to a far wider section of the population. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wider inclusion</h2>
<p>In the US, stock market performance routinely features in political debate and retail participation is the norm. Total equity market capitalisation is around 55 trillion dollars, or 200% of GDP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, three quarters of corporate financing in the EU is bank lending and, as we have heard, efforts to promote a capital markets union recognise the implications of this for the real economy.</p>
<p>UK market capitalisation stands at around 3.2 trillion dollars, or 100% of GDP. But since the heady days of the 1980s, structural and other factors have fostered a low-to-no risk culture, which if left unaddressed, has clear implications for our ability to finance future economic growth.</p>
<p>Back in Hong Kong, I saw a very different investment culture. One in which retail participation was far greater than here in the UK, and where people were much more aware of how the market works and the risks involved.</p>
<p>In the UK,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.newfinancial.org/reports/widening-retail-participation-in-equity-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the proportion of households<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;directly owning stocks and shares has halved in 2 decades. According to New Financial, just 4.4% of UK pension funds assets are held in domestic equities. That has a huge opportunity cost for capital hungry businesses, and for the wider economy.</p>
<p>It creates a gap for individuals, too.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/09/the-uk-investment-gap--p430-billion-in-cash-savings-not-invested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barclays reports<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;that 13 million UK adults are missing out by holding &pound;430 billion in cash savings which could be put to more productive use. So, we are looking to address this.</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review</h2>
<p>Our Review with the Government of the boundary between regulated financial advice and guidance is incredibly technical. Unpicking the interplay between our own rules, domestic legislation and consolidated EU law is hard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But its aim is simple: unlocking innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs, in easy-to-access ways, at prices they can afford, so they have the confidence to make the most of their money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in doing this, we boost growth: for personal finances, for those seeking investment, and for the UK as a whole.</p>
<h2>Value for Money Framework</h2>
<p>This goal also underpins our Framework, developed jointly with Government and The Pensions Regulator, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/pensions-value-money" title="Pensions value for money">value for money</a>&nbsp;for workplace pension savers.</p>
<p>This seeks to ensure the &pound;130 billion a year saved into these schemes works harder for people. A focus on value rather than costs should help providers invest in assets that deliver greater long-term returns.</p>
<p>Through these and a raft of other initiatives, we are looking to shift our national view of risk.</p>
<p>Today has shown that many others around the world are grappling with similar issues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to continued collaboration with colleagues, both domestic and global, as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group) has lauded the German Government and its development finance institution, Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG), a subsidiary of KfW Bank, for their unwavering commitment to advancing impact investing in Nigeria. This comes as NGX Group looks to strengthen partnerships aimed at fostering sustainable development, with a focus on climate action.<br /><br />The Group Managing Director/CEO of NGX Group, Mr. Temi Popoola, made these remarks during the DEG Impact Investing Dialogue held on Tuesday, 8 October 2024, in Lagos. He acknowledged the vital role that DEG has played in deepening sustainable finance in Nigeria and bolstering confidence in the country&rsquo;s economy. "DEG, along with its counterparts in the German private sector, has demonstrated steadfast dedication to Nigeria, not only by maintaining their investments but also by expanding them through local financial institutions&rdquo;.<br /><br />Mr. Popoola also elaborated on the initiative between NGX Group and DEG to establish a framework for data sharing and aggregation related to carbon emissions and Nigeria's broader green transition. He added that the initiative seeks to bring together corporate organisations across the country, enhancing transparency while guiding them on sustainable transition pathways aligned with globally recognised standards. "Our joint efforts will not only increase corporate transparency but also ensure compliance with global sustainability standards, positioning Nigeria as a leader in sustainable finance across Africa," Popoola noted.</p>

<title>ISDA: Derivatives, Margining And Risk In Emerging Market And Developing Economies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Derivatives have an important role to play in the development of economies and financial markets in emerging jurisdictions. Financial regulation, in turn, is a critical element in shaping the safe, efficient use and growth of risk management activity in these countries. One of the most important elements of the financial regulatory framework for derivatives is margining: the exchange of collateral, or margin, for derivatives transactions. This paper explains what margining is, how it works and the key issues for policymakers in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) to consider when transposing margin-related regulation to their jurisdictions, with a particular focus on non-cleared derivatives.</p>

<title>CanDeal Data &amp; Analytics (DNA) To Distribute Consensus Canadian OIS And Swap Rates Via LSEG</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/candeal-data-and-analytics-dna-to-distribute-consensus-canadian-ois-and-swap-rat/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/candeal-data-and-analytics-dna-to-distribute-consensus-canadian-ois-and-swap-rat/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CanDeal DNA, the premier source for Canadian OTC fixed income and derivatives pricing, is partnering with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to distribute CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates are expected to become key reference rates for the market due to quality and consistency of coverage with inputs provided by, and consensus derived from, CanDeal&rsquo;s partner banks and dealers.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA works closely with industry stakeholders to provide data and solutions to support the Canadian market and global market participants. This product innovation is an extension of CanDeal&rsquo;s collaborative efforts with the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) as the market transitions away from CDOR to the new Term CORRA benchmark. CanDeal DNA publishes statistics and analysis resulting from the transition to Term CORRA in our CanDeal Observations bulletin available at <a href="http://candeal.com/" title="candeal.com">candeal.com</a>.</p>
<p>The CanDeal Consensus CAD OIS (CORRA) Rates product is designed to provide market transparency in the OIS swap curve for out to two years, while the CanDeal Consensus CAD Swap (CORRA) Rates product provides rates from two to 30 years. Each rate represents the market rate for the fixed leg of a swap where the floating leg references the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA).</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates will be available via LSEG Data &amp; Analytics under a global free-trial period until January 1, 2025. Thereafter, the products will become fee liable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal is the premier service for Canadian fixed income and interest rate derivatives data. This extension of our partnership will enable our clients to derive additional value through access to the Consensus OIS and Swap Rates,&rdquo; said Debbie Lawrence, Group Head of Data Strategy and Management at LSEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cessation of the CDOR benchmark has been a turning point for the financial industry,&rdquo; said Andre Craig, President of CanDeal DNA, a division of CanDeal Group, a leading provider of an electronic marketplace and data services for Canadian dollar debt securities and derivatives. &ldquo;In addition to collaborating with CanDeal Benchmark Solutions and market stakeholders to launch the forward-looking Term CORRA benchmark this past year, we are honored to continue to partner with the industry and with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to introduce the Consensus OIS and Swap Curves and provide deeper transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside their award-winning Reference Pricing Service, CanDeal DNA provides intraday and real-time pricing for Canadian fixed income securities, advanced and regulatory analytics, security master, and curves solutions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of a multi-asset class climate transition risk solution, which provides emissions estimates and portfolio analytics across various fixed income asset classes, covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and real estate. This new solution, combined with ICE&rsquo;s existing coverage of sovereign, corporate equity, and private companies, can enable clients to assess and benchmark their financed emissions across a comprehensive range of fixed income asset classes in one integrated offering.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s new multi-asset class transition risk solution addresses gaps in emissions data by covering underserved sub-asset classes, such as RMBS, CMBS, and private corporates. By integrating this data, ICE can provide a unified portfolio metric that tracks financed emissions across multiple asset classes, supporting climate risk reporting, ensuring a holistic portfolio coverage from a physical and transition risk standpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our clients increasingly need quality transition risk data for underserved segments, particularly mortgage-backed securities, where we have applied physics-based simulations with building energy models and ICE&rsquo;s data to provide emissions insights for RMBS and CMBS,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Head of ICE Climate. &ldquo;Mortgages and mortgage securities can represent more than 20 percent of bank balance sheets, leading to a growing need for data to help meet regulatory disclosure and support stress testing to inform decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s multi-asset class transition risk solution provides PCAF-aligned (<a href="https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/about" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials</a>) financed emissions data, encompassing over 110 million US properties and more than 4.2 million fixed income securities globally. With this solution, clients can leverage advanced portfolio analytics to evaluate total emissions across multi-asset class portfolios, assisting clients in transition risk strategies. ICE&rsquo;s methodologies, customized for each asset class, provide comprehensive emissions tracking, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 estimates, as well as carbon intensity metrics, essential to meet climate regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>This new solution is part of the company&rsquo;s climate data offering, which provides data and analytics that help quantify investment impacts posed by transition risks as well as physical climate risks, such as extreme weather events.</p>
