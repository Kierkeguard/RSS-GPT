<div> Federal Reserve, discount window, monetary policy, primary credit, economy <br>
<br>Summary: The article discusses the historical perspective and evolution of the discount window, recent changes, outreach efforts, technology enhancements, and future steps. <div>
<p>Thank you, Steve, for that kind introduction and for the opportunity to talk to this group today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>Yesterday I shared my historical perspective on the discount window at Davidson College.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In 1913, when the Federal Reserve was established, the discount window was the main tool it used to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. More than 110 years later, the discount window continues to play an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and the effective implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today I would like to discuss with you how the discount window has evolved in the 21st century, including recent steps the Federal Reserve Board has taken to solicit feedback from the public on discount window operations. Before I address our most recent efforts, however, I will review some important episodes in discount window history that brought us to where we are today.</p>
<p>First, I will recount briefly events in the 1980s and early 1990s that provide important context for the reappraisal of the discount window in the early 2000s. Second, I will summarize revisions to the discount window that the Fed made in 2003 and some additional changes made since then. Third, I will describe efforts that the Fed has taken to ensure that the discount window remains effective today, including the request for information that the Board recently issued on operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit. After completing my discussion of the discount window, I will conclude with my outlook for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>Events before the 2003 Discount Window Revisions</strong><br />I would like to pick up today where I left off yesterday in my speech at Davidson College: the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a period of widespread problems in the commercial banking sector. Troubled institutions borrowed from the discount window for extended periods of time as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the closure of these institutions. As a result, the discount window became associated strongly with lending to troubled institutions. Healthy banks' reluctance to borrow from the discount window increased. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This led to a reassessment of the discount window in the early 2000s and to eventual revisions implemented in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>A Reassessment of the Discount Window in the Early 2000s</strong><br />The key challenge in the reassessment of the discount window was to establish a lending program that would not only operate effectively and support monetary policy implementation, but also mitigate moral hazard and provide sufficient controls to minimize risk to Reserve Banks and, ultimately, to American taxpayers. After the reassessment, the Fed implemented several changes aimed to achieve the right balance.</p>
<p>The Board replaced the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a below-market rate, with a new type of discount window credit called primary credit. This new type of discount window credit became effective in 2003.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;It is available as a backup source of liquidity to depository institutions in generally sound financial condition at an above-market rate. Making the discount rate a penalty rate is more consistent with the long-standing practice of other major central banks. This feature was intended to reduce the need for administrative pressures based on Reserve Bank staff judgment of inappropriate usage when the discount rate was below market rates. Although those measures effectively limited usage that was deemed inappropriate at the time, they also presented communication challenges regarding when it was appropriate to use the discount window and perpetuated the perception that the Fed discouraged its use.</p>
<p>Primary credit is a "no questions asked" facility in which eligible depository institutions are no longer required to have exhausted other sources of funding or be subject to restrictions on the use of the borrowed funds. The Fed initially set the primary credit rate 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Since March 2020, the Fed has set the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>At the same time primary credit was established, another new program, called secondary credit, replaced the extended credit program. Secondary credit is available to depository institutions that are not eligible for primary credit. It was initially available at an interest rate 50 basis points higher than the primary credit rate, which is the spread in effect today. In contrast to primary credit, extensions under secondary credit are subject to higher collateral discounts and may involve ongoing oversight on the use of funds obtained under the program, reflecting the less-sound condition of secondary credit borrowers. Typically, Reserve Banks review a depository institution's plan to repay the loan and return to market sources of funding.</p>
<p>This two-tiered structure of providing the no-questions-asked primary credit program for healthy depository institutions and the secondary credit program for less-than-healthy depository institutions was designed primarily to instill public confidence in the health of institutions borrowing from the primary credit program and to reduce the reluctance of healthy depository institutions to borrow.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;In addition, having two separate facilities would reinforce the notion that healthy and troubled depository institutions alike should regard borrowing from the Fed as an option in the event of a need for additional funds.</p>
<p>In the early years of the switch to the new facilities, there were signs that healthy depository institutions became more willing to borrow from the discount window. For example, some research found that after the 2003 discount window revisions, banks borrowed more from the discount window when the federal funds rate spiked than they had previously.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This finding suggests that the redesign of the discount window was effective in reducing banks' reluctance to borrow. As a result, the discount window may have been more effective in placing a ceiling on short-term funding rates, aiding the implementation of monetary policy, and serving as a liquidity tool when needed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to measure reluctance to borrow from the discount window. When the interest rate on primary credit is above the target federal funds rate and the federal funds rate is close to its target, the aggregate volume of primary credit is expected to be low. In other words, a low average level of discount window borrowing does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow; instead, it could simply reflect a situation in which depository institutions do not currently need to borrow. In addition, when there is an abundance of liquidity in the banking system, as is the case in the current ample-reserves monetary policy regime, depository institutions may have less need to obtain additional liquidity via the discount window. Again, this does not necessarily mean that there is a reluctance to borrow. Conversely, the presence of discount window borrowing does not necessarily reflect the absence of a reluctance to borrow. It could be the case that, although aggregate usage increases, there are still some depository institutions that are willing to pay well above the primary credit rate even when they could have borrowed readily from the discount window. For these reasons, it is important that we complement data with market outreach information to assess the effectiveness of the discount window.</p>
<p><strong>Changes and Challenges since the Introduction of Primary and Secondary Credit</strong><br />Primary and secondary credit exist today, but some changes have been made to primary credit since its inception. For example, although the discount window was used extensively and played an important role in the emergency measures taken during the financial crisis of 2007&ndash;09, some depository institutions during this period still were willing to borrow funds from the market at rates above the discount rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This suggested that there was a reluctance to borrow before the crisis, and that reluctance appeared to grow over the course of the crisis. To promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets and provide depository institutions with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding, the Board approved temporary changes to its primary credit discount window facility during the crisis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in late 2007, the Board established the Term Auction Facility (TAF).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Concerns about lending to troubled depository institutions reemerged after the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 2010, Congress required the Fed to publish detailed individual institution borrowing data with a two-year lag.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This action was intended to enhance the transparency and accountability of Federal Reserve lending while still preserving a measure of confidentiality to avoid discouraging depository institutions from borrowing.</p>
<p>More recently, in March 2020, the Fed announced changes to the provision of primary credit that were intended to encourage depository institutions to use the discount window to meet demands for credit from households and businesses in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes included setting the primary credit rate at a level equal to the top of the federal funds target range&mdash;a step that enhanced the ability of the discount window to support trading within the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate&mdash;and communicating the terms of borrowing as 90 days, prepayable and renewable on a daily basis. To further encourage depository institutions to use the discount window, the Fed also made changes to its reporting of Reserve Bank&ndash;level aggregate weekly discount window borrowing. It consolidated amounts previously reported as "loans," which include discount window borrowing, into a broader category of assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;The changes made in 2020 remain in effect.</p>
<p>During and after the spring 2023 stress events, the discount window again played an important role in supporting both monetary policy and financial stability. Depository institutions that came under severe stress turned to the discount window. The discount window also served an important role in providing ready access to funding, especially for depository institutions experiencing spillovers from the bank failures. To further ensure that depository institutions had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors, the Board announced the creation of a new emergency program, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). Although the BTFP was established pursuant to the Board's emergency lending authority in section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the BTFP used the discount window infrastructure to lend to eligible depository institution borrowers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;By relying on the existing discount window infrastructure, the BTFP was able to begin operating right away. The program ceased extending new loans on March 11, 2024, as scheduled.</p>
<p>Today the discount window continues to be an effective tool, but it is important to acknowledge that economic and banking conditions continue to evolve. Since the 2003 discount window reassessment, we have seen an increased focus on liquidity in banking regulation, including the advent of quantitative liquidity requirements for large banking organizations; technological changes in the banking system; a general trend toward faster and 24-7-365 payment systems; changes in the composition and posture of Federal Home Loan Bank lending; and the move to an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve System has taken important steps to ensure that the discount window performs its functions successfully in the 21st-century economy. For example, last year the Board, along with the other federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration, issued guidance on contingency funding plans that encouraged depository institutions to be ready to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;This includes taking steps to establish borrowing relationships with the Federal Reserve, such as providing certain legal documentation and ensuring that collateral to secure loans is ready to pledge. In connection with interagency initiatives, Reserve Banks have conducted outreach to depository institutions and made efforts to guide them in using the discount window.</p>
<p>Data suggest that this encouragement is working. By the end of 2023, 3,900 banks, or roughly 80 percent of all banks, had completed the legal documentation required to borrow from the discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Of those, nearly 2,000 banks had pledged collateral, with an aggregate lendable value of over $2.6 trillion after applying appropriate discounts. These figures are notably above their levels at the end of 2021 and 2022. Although I am pleased to see the improvements in discount window readiness statistics, continued outreach is still important. To that effect, this summer, Federal Reserve Banks hosted an Ask the Fed&reg; session to discuss the purpose of the discount window, its facilities, and recommendations for depository institutions on how to prepare to borrow from the Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Reserve System has made important investments to enhance the technology that supports discount window activities. Earlier this year, the System launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to request and prepay loans as well as securely message their local Reserve Bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Discount Window Direct generally is accessible 24 hours a day. We are actively encouraging the use of Discount Window Direct.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking Feedback on the Discount Window</strong><br />To complement our efforts to enhance discount window operations, the Federal Reserve Board recently announced that it is collecting feedback from the public on operational frictions associated with the discount window and intraday credit through the issuance of a request for information. As some of you may know, a request for information is a formal document through which a government agency solicits feedback. Members of the public can submit comments in response to the request for information until December 9, 2024.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241009a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a></p>
<p>The Board requests input on various discount window and intraday credit operational practices, such as the process for requesting, receiving, and repaying discount window loans as well as Reserve Bank discount window and intraday credit communications practices. Through the request for information, the Board hopes to gain further insight into the operational aspects that are the most costly or burdensome for depository institutions. This will help the Fed consider further improvements to promote efficiency and reduce burden on depository institutions. Ultimately, the Fed's goal is to build on the current discount window operations and processes so that the discount window will continue to provide ready access to funding against a wide range of collateral in the future. I encourage members of the public to submit comments on the request for information, and I look forward to considering the feedback that we receive.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />Before concluding, let me share with you a summary of my outlook for the U.S. economy, as I did yesterday with the audience at Davidson. Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the FOMC's 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. See Jefferson (2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For more details about this period, see Clouse (1994). In response to the wave of depository institution failures, Congress placed legal limitations on Federal Reserve lending to troubled institutions. Specifically, section 142 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) amended section 10B of the Federal Reserve Act to place restraints on discount window lending to undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized insured depository institutions. FDICIA also imposed liability on the Board of Governors for excess losses incurred by the FDIC that are attributable to lending beyond those limits. The provisions of FDICIA were intended to reduce moral hazard in the banking system and limit taxpayer losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For more details, see the October 31, 2002, Federal Reserve press release (Board of Governors, 2002b) and the final rule implementing the changes (Board of Governors, 2002a).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In 2003, when primary credit was implemented, there was a single federal funds target rate. The Federal Open Market Committee adopted a federal funds target range on December 16, 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For details on the change to the rate spread announced in March 2020, see the press release (Board of Governors, 2020). As will be discussed in greater detail later, before 2020, the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate (or top of the target range) had changed a few times to address economic conditions during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the subsequent recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. This design feature also would help Reserve Banks manage risk more easily by establishing a standardized approach and risk controls when lending through a facility reserved for troubled depository institutions. Loans to troubled depository institutions entail more risk to the lending Reserve Bank, and depository institutions that are undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized are subject to lending limitations under FDICIA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. See Artu&ccedil; and Demiralp (2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. See Bernanke (2009a) and Madigan (2009) for a retrospective that elaborates on some of the emergency measures taken during the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis and the reasoning for discount window rate changes during the financial crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Throughout this crisis, the Board approved numerous reductions in the primary credit rate and narrowed the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate twice. With the narrowing of the spread in August 2007 from 100 basis points to 50 basis points and in March 2008 to 25 basis points, the Board announced that the maximum term for primary credit loans would be extended, first to 30 days and then to 90 days, respectively. As economic conditions improved, in 2010, the Board increased the spread between the primary credit rate and the target federal funds rate to 50 basis points and shortened the maximum term for primary credit loans to overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. The TAF provided fixed quantities of term credit to depository institutions through an auction mechanism and seemed to have largely addressed banks' concern that borrowing from the Federal Reserve would imply weakness. According to Bernanke (2009b, paragraph 7), this was "partly because the sizable number of borrowers provides a greater assurance of anonymity, and possibly also because the three-day period between the auction and auction settlement suggests that the facility's users are not using it to meet acute funding needs on a particular day."&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. See section 1103 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act.&nbsp;</p>

The Board's H.4.1 statistical release, "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41">Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks</a>," is published weekly. It presents a balance sheet for each Federal Reserve Bank, a consolidated balance sheet for all 12 Reserve Banks, an associated statement that lists the factors affecting reserve balances of depository institutions, and several other tables presenting information on the assets, liabilities, and commitments of the Federal Reserve Banks. For additional details on the consolidation of "loans" into a broader category of assets, see the March 19, 2020, H.4.1 announcement, available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319/">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200319</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. As with the discount window, an eligible institution participated in the BTFP through its local Reserve Bank. The legal agreements and process for pledging securities in the BTFP also relied on those used in discount window lending. Nevertheless, the BTFP differed from the discount window in various ways, including the term of lending, scope of eligible collateral, collateral valuation, and interest rate.

<div> Report, Investor Education, Crypto-Assets, Risks, Regulation
<br />
IOSCO released a report on crypto-asset investor education. It highlights risks, regulatory changes, and the need for financial literacy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>IOSCO is pleased to release its Final Report on Investor Education surrounding Crypto-Assets. This Report summarizes the results of a survey distributed to members of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee for Retail Investors (C8) in autumn last year about retail investor behaviour, demographics, and experiences with crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Crypto-assets have been a key priority for IOSCO for some time and in 2022 it established a Board-level FinTech Task Force to develop, oversee, deliver and implement IOSCO&rsquo;s work with respect to FinTech and crypto-assets. Early work has shown that investors are drawn to invest in crypto-assets for three key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of missing out&rdquo;      (&ldquo;FOMO&rdquo;) or as a speculative investment;</li>
<li>Low cost of entry; and</li>
<li>Advice from friends      and/or social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD769.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917581430%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=0LGr%2FUUPTFWUWuvBLJfCCSztwgdjVWxYIWvxS%2FIPvug%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Final Report</a> highlights examples of regulatory changes and enforcement activity by C8 members since the <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD668.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917610936%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=PiFrAW5%2B2uHm6z6G9UO6%2BqDc%2BXU7p2pA0C7tjbdiXEQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">related 2020 report</a>, as well as current priority issues around investor education in the crypto-asset space, such as relationship investment scams and the need to communicate with retail investors on, and about, social media.</p>
<p>The Report suggests specific investor education messages which C8 members could consider when driving forward education of crypto-assets in their local jurisdiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Investments in crypto-assets can be      exceptionally risky and these assets are often volatile.</em></li>
<li><em>Investors should be wary of investments      promoted on social media and use skepticism when following &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>Crypto-asset investments might lack basic      investor protections, as those offering crypto-asset investments or      services may not be complying with applicable law, including registration      and licensing requirements.</em></li>
<li><em>Investments offered in compliance with a      jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory framework confers investors with certain      investor protections.</em></li>
<li><em>Fraudsters continue to exploit the rising      popularity of crypto-assets to lure retail investors into scams, often      leading to devastating losses.</em></li>
<li><em>Understanding the nature of investing      generally, including having an investing plan, and understanding risk      tolerance and time horizon, as well as understanding the nature of      investing in crypto-assets, can be critical to overall and long-term      investing success.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO, commented: &ldquo;<em>With such growing widespread interest in crypto-assets, retail investors are subject to unique risks. Market events have shown that the industry carries high levels of volatility, failures, and bad actors causing harm to investors and the markets.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>It is not surprising, therefore, that crypto-asset education is one of IOSCO&rsquo;s top priorities and forms a big part of this year&rsquo;s World Investor Week, which highlights a number of common challenges that we all face as financial regulators and as financial consumers.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking place over the course of this week, IOSCO&rsquo;s annual World Investor Week is a platform to promote financial education and literacy. <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldinvestorweek.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7Ccadccd9a39f544ca7e2c08dce866e83c%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638640775917627842%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=htx%2F5VgIUb3S92SUDfTE%2F%2F%2FYCzuCRQ58uUsC%2Fypzcek%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">https://www.worldinvestorweek.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Servais added: &ldquo;<em>Financial education is a complementary tool to regulation and supervision to enhance investors&rsquo; awareness, critical sense and rational behaviour. Financial literacy must go hand in hand with appropriate investor protection measures, fair advice, supervision and enforcement of rules.</em>&rdquo;</p>

Summary:<br />
Eventus and Bitnomial announce partnership for trade surveillance. Bitnomial selects Eventus Validus platform to enhance market surveillance capabilities. Bitnomial Exchange sees record growth. <br />Summary:<br /> <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions,&nbsp;and Bitnomial, Inc. a digital asset derivatives exchange company that operates CFTC regulated exchange, clearinghouse and settlement businesses, today announced that Bitnomial Exchange has selected the Eventus Validus platform for all of its trade surveillance needs. Bitnomial sought a comprehensive, scalable trade surveillance solution as the firm has grown extensively and expanded into new products and business lines.</p>
<p>Bitnomial and Eventus have had a strategic partnership since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">May 2021</span>, when Eventus began providing seamless integration of order and execution flow on behalf of two large futures commission merchant (FCM) clients that are members of the exchange. Bitnomial Exchange's decision to deploy Validus followed a review of both internal trade surveillance capabilities and the offerings of Eventus and other external providers as the exchange decided how best to build on its internal surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p><span class="xn-person">Michael Dunn</span>, President of Bitnomial Exchange, commented on the news: "We are thrilled to adopt Eventus' Validus platform to enhance our market surveillance capabilities. This partnership builds on our years of collaboration to support our mutual customers and deliver a secure, transparent and highly efficient trading experience. Integrating Eventus' advanced surveillance tools with our proprietary, in-house surveillance system strengthens our commitment to compliance and transparency, while reinforcing the trust our clients place in Bitnomial Exchange."</p>
<p>Eventus CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Travis Schwab</span>&nbsp;said: "Bitnomial continues to see phenomenal growth as an exchange business that can meet the needs of the most discerning institutional investors. Our extensive experience in digital assets globally, combined with internal markets and regulatory expertise and a best-of-breed solution, all played a role in this selection. We're excited to build on our relationship and serve as a trusted partner supporting Bitnomial's continued growth and the integrity of its markets."</p>
<p>In August, Bitnomial Exchange announced record growth for the quarter ending on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">June 30</span>&nbsp;and over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$130 million</span>&nbsp;in notional value traded during the first half of 2024, representing a 1,081% increase during the same period in 2023. The&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>-based exchange offering physically settled&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;futures and options was founded in 2014 to provide a regulated, secure environment for institutional and professional traders to participate in&nbsp;<span>cryptocurrency</span>&nbsp;derivatives markets. Late last year, the CFTC approved Bitnomial's clearinghouse, and the exchange recently introduced Hashrate futures in partnership with Luxor targeting&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;miners.</p>

<div> technology, ISDA Ops, risk management, automation, Validus<br />
Summary:<br />
Validus introduces ISDA Ops for automated ISDA ATE and CSA Threshold calculation, real-time risk management, enhanced reporting, scenario analytics, and integration with existing platforms. <div>
<p>Validus Risk Management (&lsquo;Validus&rsquo;), a leading independent financial risk advisory and technology firm, has introduced ISDA Ops, a groundbreaking solution aimed at automating the calculation and monitoring of complex ISDA Additional Termination Events (ATEs) and Credit Support Annexes (CSA) Thresholds.</p>
<p>The solution provides an intelligent and scalable approach to constructing ATE and CSA Threshold conditions. The new platform significantly enhances efficiency by simplifying the management of ISDA and CSA terms, offering a streamlined approach for handling counterparty and liquidity risks.</p>
<p>The complexity of monitoring ATEs and CSA Thresholds has historically presented significant challenges for financial institutions. Using Validus&rsquo; proprietary technology, ISDA Ops was developed taking into consideration over 2,000 trading lines across more than 40 major counterparties, providing a monitoring platform, which allows users to analyse and test conditions using live and forecasted data. The tailor-made design of the Expression Builder provides complete flexibility, allowing full customisation and accommodating all possible terms. ISDA Ops empowers real-time proactive decision-making, enabling firms to manage collateral requirements and counterparty risk more effectively.</p>
<p>Key benefits of ISDA Ops include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Automated Tracking and Calculation:</b>&nbsp;ISDA Ops provides automatic calculation and tracking of ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds across all counterparties, ensuring seamless risk management.</li>
<li><b>Real-Time Risk Management:</b>&nbsp;Users can proactively make decisions in real time, significantly improving the management of counterparty and liquidity risks by identifying potential collateral calls early.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Reporting:</b>&nbsp;The platform provides intelligent reporting tools that simplify the process of tracking and updating ISDA terms, boosting transparency.</li>
<li><b>Scenario Analytics:</b>&nbsp;With the ability to test conditions using both live and forecasted data, ISDA Ops enable users to simulate potential future scenarios and proactively address potential risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ISDA Ops integrates with Validus&rsquo; Horizon platform, including RiskView, a configurable hedging monitoring and reporting framework, TradeView, a front-office hedging platform, and PortfolioView, a portfolio-level risk management platform. The new features enable&nbsp;CSA Thresholds to be updated and monitored within RiskView, proactively identifying potential collateral calls, while PortfolioView data is integrated for condition testing.</p>
<p><b>Alain Smith, Head of Client Engagement at Validus Risk Management, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Monitoring and managing ISDA ATEs and CSA Thresholds are crucial risk management functions but has historically proven a major challenge due to the scale and complexity of the task. ISDA Ops therefore represents a significant breakthrough for risk management teams &ndash; presenting a clear, consolidated view of the data and allowing users to identify breaches and model for future risks. Cutting-edge technology has made processing huge volumes of data possible, looking to the future our aim is to keep ISDA Ops at the forefront &ndash; deploying generative AI to deepen the capabilities of our game-changing solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Validus is scheduled to deliver further enhancements to ISDA Ops before the end of the year, using generative AI to efficiently parse complex language, scale the offering and drive faster data retrieval. The launch follows the announcement in June that Validus delivered several upgrades to TradeView, enabling automation pre-trade checks.</p>

</ul>
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, has published the results of its annual country classification review for countries monitored by its global equity and fixed income indices.</p>
<h4><span>Fixed Income</span></h4>
<p>FTSE Russell is pleased to announce that&nbsp;<span>South Korea</span>&nbsp;will be reclassified from Market Accessibility 1 to 2, and South Korean government bonds will be added to the FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI), effective with November 2025 index profiles and phased in over a one-year period on a quarterly basis. Since being placed on the Watch List in September 2022, several initiatives intended to improve the accessibility of South Korean government bonds for international investors have been implemented by market authorities. Most recently, these efforts have facilitated connectivity with International Central Securities Depositaries in June 2024 for the South Korean bond market and permitted third-party foreign exchange for South Korean won starting in July 2024. Following this confirmatory announcement regarding index inclusion, FTSE Russell encourages global financial market infrastructure providers to continue their readiness activities to support future investment in the South Korean government bond market by WGBI users and leverage the benefits of the market structure reforms. FTSE Russell continues to welcome feedback from index stakeholders on such process to ensure a frictionless inclusion of the South Korea government bond market in the WGBI.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nikki Stefanelli, Head of Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Index Policy at FTSE Russell, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We congratulate South Korean market authorities on their efforts to expand and encourage global investment in their local government bond market. FTSE Russell have closely monitored the capital markets reforms that have been implemented by South Korean market authorities over the past two years and their effectiveness in achieving the rigorous accessibility criteria for WGBI inclusion. We look forward to continuing to support the market as it undertakes readiness activities ahead of index inclusion at the end of next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mr. Sang-mok Choi, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Korea comments:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Over the last two years, the South Korean government has announced a series of initiatives to strengthen its capital markets for both domestic and international investors, which have now been successfully implemented. Over this time, we have had a positive engagement with FTSE Russell and international market participants on the impact of these efforts and their ability to facilitate inclusion of South Korean government bonds in the FTSE WGBI, which requires the highest level of market accessibility. We are pleased with the process, and more importantly the outcome with FTSE Russell&rsquo;s decision today.&nbsp; The MOEF are committed to continuing and strengthening its engagement with market participants to ensure a smooth index inclusion starting in November 2025, which will bring a welcomed increase in international investment in our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FTSE Russell announces that the Market Accessibility Level for&nbsp;<span>India&nbsp;</span>will be reclassified from 0 to 1, and Indian government bonds will be included in the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI), starting in September 2025. This decision reflects the continued progress in the accessibility of the market for these securities for international investors and the growing importance of the Indian government bond market in mainstream global emerging markets bond portfolios. FTSE Russell thanks the Reserve Bank of India for its continued dialogue and commitment to facilitating international investment in its local market.</p>

Tradeweb FTSE closing bond prices are based on bid-side and offer-side price quotes supplied by market makers to Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic trading platform for institutional dealer and clients during a pre-determined collection window each day. The closing prices, which are derived from these quotes, offer index users a more representative, transparent and robust approach to valuing fixed income securities. In its role as benchmark administrator for these closing prices, FTSE Russell is in a unique position to ensure they are calculated in line with its rigorous governance standards.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hicks and Tara Boehmler, for the kind introduction.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Let me start by saying that I am saddened by the tragic loss of life, destruction, and damage resulting from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, and throughout this region. My thoughts are with the people and communities affected, including those in the Davidson College family. For our part, the Federal Reserve and other federal and state financial regulatory agencies are working with banks and credit unions in the affected area to help make sure they can continue to meet the financial services needs of their communities.</p>
<p>I am happy to be back at Davidson College. This is a special community. I am bound to it by a shared experience defined not by its length, but by its intensity. As I visited with you today, and as I look around this hall, I see the faces of colleagues who became dear friends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, we spoke often about the unprecedented uncertainty we faced. Amidst that uncertainty, however, we supported each other on this campus. Now, looking back, we can attest that this mutual support was vital. I am grateful to have been amongst you during that unprecedented time. Today, I am proud to see that Davidson is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>I am excited to be here with you this evening and to talk to you about the history of the Federal Reserve's discount window.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The discount window is one of the tools the Fed uses to support the liquidity and stability of the banking system, and to implement monetary policy effectively. It was created in 1913 when the Fed was established. Today, more than 110 years later, this tool continues to play an important role. At the Fed, we always look for ways to improve our tools, including our discount window operations. Recently, the Fed published a request for information document to receive feedback from the public regarding operational aspects of the discount window and intraday credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Today, I will do three things. First, I will discuss briefly my outlook for the U.S. economy. Second, I will offer my historical perspective on the discount window, starting in 1913 and ending in 2000. Finally, I will provide a few details about the request for information the Fed recently published.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will say more about the discount window when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook and Considerations for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace. Inflation has eased substantially. The labor market has cooled from its formerly overheated state.</p>
<p>As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide3.png" id="fig3">slide 3</a>, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, well down from 6.5 percent two years earlier. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.7 percent, compared with 5.2 percent two years earlier. Our restrictive monetary policy stance played a role in restraining demand and in keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of inflation surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures from financial markets. Inflation is now much closer to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2 percent objective. I expect that we will continue to make progress toward that goal.</p>
<p>While, overall, the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, the labor market has modestly cooled. Employers added an average of 186,000 jobs per month during July through September, a slower pace than seen early this year. A shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide4.png" id="fig4">slide 4</a>, the unemployment rate now stands at 4.1 percent, up from 3.8 percent in September 2023. Meanwhile, job openings declined by about 4 million since their peak in March 2022. The good news is that the rise in unemployment has been limited and gradual, and the level of unemployment remains historically low. Even so, the cooling in the labor market is noticeable.</p>
<p>Congress mandated the Fed to pursue maximum employment and price stability. The balance of risks to our two mandates has changed&mdash;as risks to inflation have diminished and risks to employment have risen, these risks have been brought roughly into balance. The FOMC has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal. To maintain the strength of the labor market, my FOMC colleagues and I recalibrated our policy stance last month, lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide5.png" id="fig5">slide 5</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will carefully watch incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks when considering additional adjustments to the federal funds target range, our primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. My approach to monetary policymaking is to make decisions meeting by meeting. As the economy evolves, I will continue to update my thinking about policy to best promote maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p><strong>Discount Window History</strong><br /><em>1913: The Fed was established</em><br />Now, I will turn to my perspective on the history of the discount window. Understanding this history is important as we consider ways to ensure the discount window continues to serve effectively in its critical role of providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve.</p>
<p>Before the Federal Reserve was founded, the U.S. experienced frequent financial panics. One example is illustrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide6.png" id="fig6">slide 6</a>&nbsp;with a newspaper clipping from the Rocky Mountain Times printed on July 19, 1893. It depicts panic swirling against banks at a time when bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. The illustration shows how waves of panic hit public confidence, the rocks in the picture, and how banks have a fortress mentality. They stand strong against the panic, but they are not lending, and they are isolated.</p>
<p>Back then, the supply of money to the economy was inelastic in the short term, in part because the monetary system in the U.S. was based on the gold standard. Demand for cash, however, varied over the course of the year and was particularly strong during harvest season, when crops were brought to the market. The surge in demand for cash, combined with the inelastic supply of money in the short term, caused financial conditions to tighten seasonally. The banking system was fairly good at moving money to where it needed to go, but it had little scope to expand the total amount of money available in response to the U.S. economy's needs. So if a shock hit the economy when financial conditions were already tight, then the banking system struggled to provide the extra liquidity needed. Banks would seek to preserve liquidity by reducing their investments and denying loan requests, for example. Depositors, fearful that they might not be able to access their funds when they needed them, would rush to withdraw their money. Of course, that caused the banks to conserve further on liquidity. In some cases, they simply closed their doors until the storm passed. When banks closed their doors, economic activity would contract.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Activity would recover when the banks reopened, but the economic suffering in the meantime was meaningful.</p>
<p>In addition to the supply of money in the economy being inelastic in the short term, two prominent frictions, asymmetric information and externalities, made banks and private markets vulnerable to systemic crises. Here, asymmetric information refers to the fact that customers do not have access to all the information they need to evaluate whether a bank is insolvent, illiquid, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, customers rely on imperfect signals, such as news reports about another bank failing, to decide whether to withdraw their money from their own bank.</p>
<p>Then there are externalities, in the sense that an individual bank may not consider how an innocent bystander may be negatively impacted by its actions. When a financial institution fails, that may lead depositors to withdraw money from other unrelated banks, which may in turn cause those banks to fail. Contagion can transform a single bank failure into a systemic crisis, where many banks fail, credit evaporates, the stock market collapses, the economy enters a recession, and the unemployment rate increases dramatically.</p>
<p>The severe financial panic of 1907 stands out as an example of market failure due to these two prominent frictions. The panic was triggered by a series of bad banking decisions that led to a frenzy of withdrawals caused by asymmetric information and public distrust in the liquidity of the banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Banks in many large cities, including financial centers such as New York and Chicago, simply stopped sending payments outside of their communities. The resulting disruption in the payment system and to the flow of liquidity through the banking system led to a severe, though short-lived, economic contraction. This experience led Congress to pass the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This act created the Federal Reserve System, composed of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In 1913, the main monetary policy tool at the Fed's disposal was the discount window. At that time, the Fed did not use open market operations&mdash;the buying and selling of government securities in the open market&mdash;to conduct monetary policy. Instead, the Fed adjusted the money supply by lending directly to banks that needed funds through the discount window. The Fed's ability to provide funds to banks as needed made the money supply of the U.S. more elastic and considerably reduced the seasonal volatility in interest rates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;This ability also enabled the Fed to provide stability in times of stress, helping banks that experienced rapid withdrawals to satisfy their customers' demand for liquidity and thereby potentially preventing banking panics.</p>
<p><em>1920s: The Fed began to discourage strongly use of the discount window</em><br />In fact, many researchers have argued that the existence of the Fed's discount window prevented a financial crisis in the early 1920s, when the banking sector came under pressure as the U.S. economy transitioned to a peacetime economy following the end of World War I.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;There had been an agricultural boom during the war and a significant accumulation of debt within that sector. Farmers came under pressure as the prices of agricultural goods dropped from wartime highs. The banks sought to support their customers, and the Fed sought to support the banks. There were serious concerns about the condition of several banks in parts of the country. The Fed's discount window lending provided critical support that saved many banks but also resulted in habitual use of the discount window by some banks during the 1920s.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide7.png" id="fig7">Slide 7</a>&nbsp;shows that as of August 1925, 593 member banks, 6 percent of the total, had been borrowing for a year or more from Federal Reserve Banks. Moreover, there were real solvency problems, and several banks failed with discount window loans outstanding. These challenges resulted in the Fed strongly discouraging banks from continuous borrowing from the discount window and the adoption of a policy of encouraging a "reluctance to borrow."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>By 1926, the Fed was explicit that borrowing at the discount window was meant to be short term. As I emphasize in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide8.png" id="fig8">slide 8</a>, the Federal Reserve's annual report for 1926 stated that while continuous borrowing by a member bank may be necessary, depending on local economic conditions, "the funds of the Federal reserve banks are primarily intended to be used in meeting the seasonal and temporary requirements of members, and continuous borrowing by a member bank as a general practice would not be consistent with the intent of the Federal reserve act."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>The late 1920s also highlighted Fed concerns about the purpose of the borrowing. The Fed sought to distinguish between "speculative security loans" and loans for "legitimate business."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;A staff reappraisal of the discount mechanism stated that "[t]he controversy over direct pressure intensified in the latter part of the 1920s as an increasing flow of bank credit went into the stock market."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;In short, the Fed observed that some banks were becoming habitual borrowers from the discount window. It was concerned that an overreliance on discount window borrowings would weaken banks and make them more prone to failure.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, the Fed switched to open market operations as its primary tool for conducting monetary policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;That allowed the Fed to determine the aggregate amount of liquidity in the system and to rely on private financial markets to distribute it efficiently. The discount window would thus serve as a safety valve if there was a shock that caused conditions to tighten unexpectedly or if individual banks experienced idiosyncratic shocks or somehow lost access to interbank markets.</p>
<p>The intention of this set-up was for banks to use the discount window to borrow from the Fed only occasionally. Ordinarily and predominantly, financial institutions were supposed to rely on private markets for their funding. This set-up was designed to limit moral hazard&mdash;the possibility that institutions take unnecessary risks when there is no market discipline. This is the key balancing act. The Fed needs to be a reliable backstop to prevent financial crises, but it also needs to minimize moral hazard that comes from always standing ready to provide support.</p>
<p><em>1930s&ndash;1940s: The Great Depression and WWII</em><br />During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the banking system experienced severe stress, including many bank runs. There are many reasons why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems in the banking system in the 1930s. I will highlight only two. First, many banks were insolvent rather than illiquid. Central bank lending is not a fundamental solution in those circumstances. When banks are insolvent, it is important to manage the closure in as orderly a manner as possible. The establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 gave bank regulators increased ability to do that. Relatedly, the challenging experiences of lending to troubled banks in the 1920s likely made the Fed more reluctant to lend in circumstances in which solvency concerns were material. Second, the types of collateral that the Fed was initially able to accept when lending to banks were quite limited.</p>
<p>In response, in the early 1930s Congress expanded the range of banking assets that could serve as collateral for discount window loans and added a variety of new Fed emergency lending authorities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;These new lending authorities were used in the 1930s to help alleviate distress. Some were also used in the early 1940s as the Fed helped support the World War II mobilization effort.</p>
<p>The period following the war was relatively calm. The role of the discount window shifted from addressing distress in the banking system to acting as a safety valve to manage tightness in money markets and support monetary policy operations.</p>
<p><em>1950&ndash;2000: Measures to discourage discount window borrowing</em><br />In March 1951, the U.S. Treasury and the Fed reached an agreement to separate government debt management from the conduct of monetary policy, thereby laying the foundation for the modern Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>In the 1950s, the Fed set the interest rate on discount window loans above market rates. Thus, it served as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate. The Fed continued to discourage extensive use of the discount window, but the relatively high interest rate also made its sustained use less attractive.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the Fed placed greater emphasis on open market operations to set its monetary policy stance. Concurrently, the Fed shifted to a policy of setting the interest rate on discount window loans below the market rates. Because the interest rate no longer deterred use of the window, the Fed turned increasingly to other measures, such as administrative pressures and moral suasion, to limit the frequency with which banks requested loans from the discount window. Indeed, between the late 1920s and the 1980s, the Fed adopted and amended numerous restrictions on discount window borrowing. Whenever discount window usage increased too much, the Fed tightened the restrictions to suppress borrowing.</p>
<p>For example, in the 1950s, the Fed defined appropriate and inappropriate discount window borrowing. In particular, the Board's regulations in 1955 stated that "[u]nder ordinary conditions, the continuous use of Federal Reserve credit by a member bank over a considerable period of time is not regarded as appropriate" and provided more details on how Reserve Banks should evaluate the "purpose" of a credit request.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;By 1973, the Board had made additional changes to its regulations on discount window use and defined three distinct discount window programs: adjustment credit, intended to help depository institutions meet short-term liquidity needs; seasonal credit, intended to help small depository institutions manage liquidity needs that arise from seasonal swings in loans and deposits; and extended credit, intended to help depository institutions that have somewhat longer-term liquidity needs resulting from exceptional circumstances.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Over time, the Board added provisions in its regulations requiring banks to exhaust other sources of funding before using discount window credit.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;In addition, in the early 1980s, the Fed levied a surcharge on frequent borrowings by large banks to augment the administrative restrictions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Despite these policies to discourage use of the discount window,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide9.png" id="fig9">slide 9</a>&nbsp;shows that discount window borrowing, adjusted for the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, was notable in the 1970s and 1980s, suggesting that the discount window was an important marginal source of funding for banks during that period.</p>
<p>That changed in the 1980s and early 1990s, when there were notable solvency problems in the banking industry. During this period, the discount window provided support to troubled institutions, while the FDIC sought to find merger partners or otherwise manage the failure of these institutions in an orderly manner. The discount window activity that took place while FDIC resolutions proceeded increased the association between use of the discount window and being a troubled institution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20241008a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;As a result, banks became more reluctant to borrow from the discount window. The greater reluctance to borrow from the discount window made it less effective, both as a monetary policy tool and as a crisis-fighting tool. That resulted in a series of efforts by the Fed in the early 2000s to change how the discount window operates. Tomorrow, I will discuss those efforts when I speak at the Charlotte Economics Club.</p>
<p><em>A request for information</em><br />Before closing, I'd like to return to where I began. Understanding the history of the discount window is important as we consider ways to ensure it continues to serve effectively in its critical role in providing liquidity to the banking system as the economy and financial system evolve. One way to ensure it continues to serve effectively is to collect feedback from the public.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/images/jefferson-20241008-slide10.png" id="fig10">Slide 10</a>&nbsp;provides some touch points on the Board's request for information document. The request for information seeks feedback from the public on a range of operational practices for the discount window and intraday credit, including the collection of legal documents; the process for pledging and withdrawing collateral; the process for requesting, receiving and repaying discount window advances; the extension of intraday credit; and Reserve Bank communications practices. My colleagues and I are looking forward to this feedback to inform potential future enhancements to discount window operations. The period for responding to our request for information ends on December 9, 2024.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. The discount window is a monetary policy facility where depository institutions can request to borrow money against collateral from the Fed. The term "window" originates with the now obsolete practice of sending a bank representative to a Reserve Bank physical teller window when a bank needed to borrow money. The term "discount" refers to how depository institutions borrow money on a discount basis&mdash;interest amount for the entire loan period (plus other charges, if any) is deducted from the principal at the time a loan is disbursed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The Federal Reserve provides intraday credit to depository institutions to foster a safe and efficient payment system. For more information on intraday credit and the Board's Payment System Risk policy, see "Payment System Risk" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_about.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. Illiquidity is a short-term cash flow problem. An illiquid bank cannot pay its current obligations, such as deposit withdrawals, even though the value of the bank's assets exceeds the value of its liabilities. In other words, illiquidity means the bank does not currently have the resources to meet its current obligations. With a short-term loan, an illiquid bank would be able to pay its obligations. Insolvency is a long-term balance sheet problem. Total obligations of an insolvent bank are larger than its total assets. A short-term loan would not help an insolvent bank. Of course, evaluating the quality of a bank's loan book in real time to determine whether a bank is solvent can be extremely challenging during a crisis. In addition, in some cases, illiquidity caused by large deposit withdrawals can lead banks to sell assets at fire-sale prices that then impairs their solvency. Conversely, concerns about insolvency, even if unfounded, can lead to liquidity problems. In the bank run literature, the connections between liquidity and solvency are a key factor that gives rise to runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The panic of 1907 started in October 1907 when three brothers&mdash;F. Augustus Heinze, Otto Heinze, and Arthur P. Heinze&mdash;as well as Charles W. Morse attempted to manipulate the price of United Copper stock by purchasing a large number of shares of the company. Their plan failed, and the stock price of United Copper collapsed. The collapse led to depositor runs on banks and trust companies associated with the Heinzes and Morse. This included a run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose president was connected to Morse. The Knickerbocker Trust Company failed, and the New York Stock Exchange fell nearly 50 percent from its peak of the previous year in the wake of the failure. See Terrell (2021).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. See Shull (1971, pp. 33&ndash;34).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. See Board of Governors (1927, p. 4). In 1926, approximately one-third of all banks in the U.S. were member banks, holding about 60 percent of the total loans and investments for all banks; see Board of Governors (1926). Banks receiving charters from the federal government were required to become members of the Federal Reserve System while banks receiving charters from state governments had the option to become members. Discount window borrowing was originally limited to Federal Reserve System member banks. The Monetary Control Act of 1980 opened the window to all depository institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. See Gorton and Metrick (2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. See Anderson (1971, p. 137). In the statement, "direct pressure" refers to the Fed policy of pressuring banks not to borrow from the window. Congress may have shared some of those concerns, as the Federal Reserve Act was amended in 1933 to include a passage in section 4 requiring Reserve Banks to be careful about speculative uses of the Federal Reserve credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. Open market operations are the purchase or sale of securities (for example, U.S. Treasury bonds) in the open market by the Fed. In modern times, the short-term objective for open market operations is specified by the FOMC. For more information, please refer to "Open Market Operations" on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. There are several banking acts that do this, but especially the Banking Act of 1932, the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, and the Banking Act of 1935. Yet one more reason why the discount window was insufficient to address the problems of the banking system in the 1930s is that, during this period, nonmember banks did not have access to the discount window. These banks suffered the most during the Great Depression. The ability of nonmember banks to access the window only changed in 1980 with the Monetary Control Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. After the U.S. entered World War II, the Federal Reserve supported efforts by the Treasury to hold down the cost of financing the war by establishing caps on interest rates on Treasury securities (see, for instance, Meltzer, 2003, Chapter 7). The cap pertaining to longer-term interest rates continued to be in place until the 1951 agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn19"></a>19. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr020/fr020008/fr020008.pdf">Advances and Discounts by Federal Reserve Banks, 20 Fed. Reg. 261, 263 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(Jan. 12, 1955).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr038/fr038068/fr038068.pdf">Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 38 Fed. Reg. 9065, 9076-9077 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(April 10, 1973).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. By 1980, the Board's regulations stated that adjustment credit "generally is available only after reasonable alternative sources of funds, including credit from special industry lenders, such as Federal Home Loan Banks, the National Credit Union Administration's Central Liquidity Facility, and corporate central credit unions have been fully used"; seasonal credit was "available only if similar assistance is not available from other special industry lenders"; and other extended credit was available only "where similar assistance is not reasonably available from other sources, including special industry lenders"; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,&nbsp;<a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/fedreg/fr045/fr045159/fr045159.pdf">Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks, 45 Fed. Reg. 54009, 54009-54011 (PDF)</a>&nbsp;(Aug. 14, 1980). See also Clouse (1994).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. See Meulendyke (1992).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. A congressional inquiry found that this lending likely increased losses to the deposit insurance funds at the time and led to limitations on the ability of the Federal Reserve to provide loans to troubled depository institutions as part of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group (RCG) for the Americas met on 7 and 8 October in Santiago. The meeting was hosted by the Central Bank of Chile and the Financial Market Commission. FSB Chair, Klaas Knot, joined RCG members for the meeting.</p>
<p>On the first day, members took part in a workshop on macroprudential frameworks and discussed the interaction between micro and macroprudential policies and the institutional arrangements needed for their consistent and effective implementation. Members stressed the importance of coordination and collaboration between financial authorities to respond to financial risks in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>On the second day, members discussed recent developments and shared their thoughts on vulnerabilities they were monitoring in their jurisdictions, including heightened volatility and asset repricing risks. Members exchanged views on potential implications of recent monetary easing on capital flows and exchange rates in the region. Severe weather events have increased in frequency and intensity in the Americas. The group discussed the availability and affordability of climate and natural catastrophe insurance in the region, and implications for financial stability. Members discussed their work to strengthen the reliability and comparability of climate-related financial disclosures and to incorporate climate-related risks into their supervisory frameworks.</p>
<p>Digital innovation in payments has the potential to boost the provision of &ndash; and access to &ndash; finance in the region. Such innovation could help meet the goals of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/">G20&rsquo;s Roadmap</a>&nbsp;for cheaper, faster, more accessible and transparent cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. Members notably discussed issues and developments related to open finance, fast payment systems, central bank digital currencies and crypto-assets, and challenges in fostering digital innovation in payments. Members noted the importance of the FSB&rsquo;s work to promote greater alignment and interoperability in these frameworks within and across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Recent operational incidents, such as the CrowdStrike failure, illustrate the risks from financial institutions&rsquo; reliance on third-party providers. Members discussed their progress in implementing the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">toolkit</a>&nbsp;to help financial institutions to monitor, identify and manage risks arising from third-party services and work to strengthen their cyber resilience. Members acknowledged the FSB&rsquo;s efforts in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/04/recommendations-to-achieve-greater-convergence-in-cyber-incident-reporting-final-report/">promoting greater convergence in cyber incident reporting</a>&nbsp;and looked forward to participating in the upcoming consultation on a format for incident reporting exchange.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Americas is co-chaired by Kenneth Baker, Managing Director and CEO, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada.

The International Monetary Fund also attended this meeting.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<span class="fn"><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/fsb-americas-group-discusses-macroprudential-frameworks-climate-risks-digital-payments-and-operational-resilience/#aa5dbae1-d2c7-46f1-acd4-2dcfe06a7b98" id="aa5dbae1-d2c7-46f1-acd4-2dcfe06a7b98-link">1</a></span>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DSB, Technology Advisory Committee, OTC derivatives, application deadline, governance<br />
Summary:<br />
DSB's TAC welcomes new applicants for a two-year term. It provides technical stewardship, advises on industry consultation topics, and shapes DSB's technology roadmap. <div>
<p><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the global golden source of reference data for OTC derivatives,&nbsp;<span>today announced that the DSB&rsquo;s Technology Advisory Committee (TAC) Charter is&nbsp;</span><span>welcoming new applicants&nbsp;</span><span>ahead of a new two (2) year term</span><span>, with an application deadline of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>23rd October.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Established in 2018, the TAC provides advisory support to the DSB in recognition of required enhancements and adaptations to its technology base and services. Working alongside the DSB Product and Governance Advisory Committees, the TAC is responsible for the technical stewardship ensuring the DSB technology strategy is aligned with the needs of the markets it serves, including making recommendations to the DSB Board&nbsp;</span>on technology-related DSB industry consultation topics.<br /><br />The TAC is composed of representatives from DSB user organisations, independent experts and regulatory observers within the wider OTC derivatives community and its remit includes matters relating to both the OTC International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and the Unique Product Identifier (UPI) Services.&nbsp;The DSB invites applications from OTC-derivatives technology practitioners from across all jurisdictions and institutional types to contribute to DSB technical governance and development.</span></p>
<p><span>During previous charter terms, the TAC has focused on the DSB&rsquo;s resiliency, including the DSB&rsquo;s disaster recovery arrangements. A key development is the addition of a second &ldquo;as-production&rdquo; UAT environment, introduced to assist users with regression testing of their own IT changes against the DSB. The TAC has also launched specialist subcommittees with the Global Agile Architecture subcommittee having recently overseen the migration of&nbsp;<span>the DSB&rsquo;s infrastructure to&nbsp;</span><span>a globally distributed data repository covering multiple locations in Europe and North America.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Andy Hughes, a member of the DSB Management Team and DDO of the TAC,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;The collaboration with the TAC over the last charter term&nbsp;</span><span>which helped shape UPI implementation and its integration into the OTC ISIN Service</span><span>. This continued collaboration with the TAC members will be essential during this next charter term as the DSB expands into further global jurisdictional regions and adapts to changes in digital operations."<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB&nbsp;</strong>added<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The TAC is instrumental in shaping the DSB technology roadmap. The technical expertise of the TAC continues to play a key part in the evolution of our services. The work of the DSB industry representation groups is highly valued and designed to ensure that all developments continue to best serve industry requirements.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Securities trading, STI, AUM, derivatives, China exposure
Summary:
SGX Group's market statistics for September 2024 show significant growth in securities trading, STI outperforming, record AUM, accelerated derivatives activity, and increased commodity gains. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) today released its market statistics for September 2024. Securities trading activity grew significantly as easing monetary policies and China&rsquo;s stimulus package fuelled optimism and portfolio repositioning.</p>
<p>With China&rsquo;s economic outlook still driving regional volatility, SGX Group remained the venue of choice for market participants managing Asia exposures with unrivalled efficiency. Derivatives traded volume achieved single-day records over two consecutive days during the month, reaching as high as 3.46 million contracts across equities, foreign exchange (FX) and commodities on 25 September.</p>
<p>Key highlights:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Significant growth in securities trading activity:</span>&nbsp;Total market turnover value on SGX Securities jumped 75% year-on-year (y-o-y) in September to S$30.4 billion, while securities daily average value (SDAV) surged 67% y-o-y to S$1.45 billion &ndash; each measure at its highest since May 2022.

AUM of real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs surpassed S$1 billion for the first time on the back of strong third-quarter inflows alongside a rally in the Singapore REIT sector. Overall ETF turnover doubled y-o-y in September to S$445 million and was up 65% at S$1.18 billion for the July-to-September quarter, compared with the same period last year.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Whether in London, in Brussels, Hong Kong or New York, the same discussion is underway: how do we maximise the ability of sustainable, vibrant capital markets to drive greater volumes of investment into the real economy?</p>
<p>That question &ndash; asked by policymakers and industry alike &ndash; is why we brought you all here today and I want to thank all the speakers who have made this conference such a success.</p>
<p>I know that many of you, like me, have had whole careers dedicated to capital markets during an era where globalisation drove a remarkable surge of cross-border investment flows. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>UK equity markets reforms</h2>
<p>I started my career as one of a vast number of very junior lawyers who worked on the UK&rsquo;s gas, water, electricity and telecoms privatisations of the '80s, amid the huge changes brought about by the financial services 'big bang'.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in the astounding development of China&rsquo;s international equity and bond markets. And not long ago I led the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which is the global regulatory standard setter for securities markets.</p>
<p>I have seen first-hand how capital markets can work well. How they can drive business &ndash; with factories built, shops opened, goods delivered, people employed; how they can support long-term risk taking to deliver more secure retirements for millions of people; and how they can spur wider economic growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also seen how market fragmentation and de-globalisation can stall cross-border capital formation.</p>
<p>But it's the opportunities that are unique to market-based finance which explain why the FCA has just delivered the most significant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-overhauls-listing-rules-boost-growth-and-innovation-uk-stock-markets" title="FCA overhauls listing rules to boost growth and innovation on UK stock markets">reforms of the UK&rsquo;s public equity markets</a>&nbsp;in a generation.</p>
<p>These reforms are already having an impact, ensuring that more businesses can get into the shop window. But the harder task is to more effectively mobilise the domestic savings necessary to grow these businesses.</p>
<p>When we talk about listings regimes, stamp duty, accounting rules, or even initial public offerings (IPO&rsquo;s), those outside this room could be forgiven for thinking we&rsquo;re speaking in a foreign language, switching off as a result, unsure how any of it matters to them.</p>
<p>So, we need to make a case for it to matter to a far wider section of the population. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wider inclusion</h2>
<p>In the US, stock market performance routinely features in political debate and retail participation is the norm. Total equity market capitalisation is around 55 trillion dollars, or 200% of GDP.</p>
<p>On the other hand, three quarters of corporate financing in the EU is bank lending and, as we have heard, efforts to promote a capital markets union recognise the implications of this for the real economy.</p>
<p>UK market capitalisation stands at around 3.2 trillion dollars, or 100% of GDP. But since the heady days of the 1980s, structural and other factors have fostered a low-to-no risk culture, which if left unaddressed, has clear implications for our ability to finance future economic growth.</p>
<p>Back in Hong Kong, I saw a very different investment culture. One in which retail participation was far greater than here in the UK, and where people were much more aware of how the market works and the risks involved.</p>
<p>In the UK,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.newfinancial.org/reports/widening-retail-participation-in-equity-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the proportion of households<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;directly owning stocks and shares has halved in 2 decades. According to New Financial, just 4.4% of UK pension funds assets are held in domestic equities. That has a huge opportunity cost for capital hungry businesses, and for the wider economy.</p>
<p>It creates a gap for individuals, too.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/09/the-uk-investment-gap--p430-billion-in-cash-savings-not-invested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barclays reports<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;that 13 million UK adults are missing out by holding &pound;430 billion in cash savings which could be put to more productive use. So, we are looking to address this.</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review</h2>
<p>Our Review with the Government of the boundary between regulated financial advice and guidance is incredibly technical. Unpicking the interplay between our own rules, domestic legislation and consolidated EU law is hard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But its aim is simple: unlocking innovation so people can get the support that suits their financial needs, in easy-to-access ways, at prices they can afford, so they have the confidence to make the most of their money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, in doing this, we boost growth: for personal finances, for those seeking investment, and for the UK as a whole.</p>
<h2>Value for Money Framework</h2>
<p>This goal also underpins our Framework, developed jointly with Government and The Pensions Regulator, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/pensions-value-money" title="Pensions value for money">value for money</a>&nbsp;for workplace pension savers.</p>
<p>This seeks to ensure the &pound;130 billion a year saved into these schemes works harder for people. A focus on value rather than costs should help providers invest in assets that deliver greater long-term returns.</p>
<p>Through these and a raft of other initiatives, we are looking to shift our national view of risk.</p>
<p>Today has shown that many others around the world are grappling with similar issues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to continued collaboration with colleagues, both domestic and global, as we seek a common goal: capital markets that deliver the returns people need, and the investment that growth requires. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

He added that the initiative seeks to bring together corporate organisations across the country, enhancing transparency while guiding them on sustainable transition pathways aligned with globally recognised standards.

<title>ISDA: Derivatives, Margining And Risk In Emerging Market And Developing Economies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Derivatives have an important role to play in the development of economies and financial markets in emerging jurisdictions. Financial regulation, in turn, is a critical element in shaping the safe, efficient use and growth of risk management activity in these countries. One of the most important elements of the financial regulatory framework for derivatives is margining: the exchange of collateral, or margin, for derivatives transactions. This paper explains what margining is, how it works and the key issues for policymakers in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) to consider when transposing margin-related regulation to their jurisdictions, with a particular focus on non-cleared derivatives.</p>

<title>CanDeal Data &amp; Analytics (DNA) To Distribute Consensus Canadian OIS And Swap Rates Via LSEG</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/candeal-data-and-analytics-dna-to-distribute-consensus-canadian-ois-and-swap-rat/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CanDeal DNA, the premier source for Canadian OTC fixed income and derivatives pricing, is partnering with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to distribute CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates are expected to become key reference rates for the market due to quality and consistency of coverage with inputs provided by, and consensus derived from, CanDeal&rsquo;s partner banks and dealers.</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA works closely with industry stakeholders to provide data and solutions to support the Canadian market and global market participants. This product innovation is an extension of CanDeal&rsquo;s collaborative efforts with the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) as the market transitions away from CDOR to the new Term CORRA benchmark. CanDeal DNA publishes statistics and analysis resulting from the transition to Term CORRA in our CanDeal Observations bulletin available at <a href="http://candeal.com/" title="candeal.com">candeal.com</a>.</p>
<p>The CanDeal Consensus CAD OIS (CORRA) Rates product is designed to provide market transparency in the OIS swap curve for out to two years, while the CanDeal Consensus CAD Swap (CORRA) Rates product provides rates from two to 30 years. Each rate represents the market rate for the fixed leg of a swap where the floating leg references the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA).</p>
<p>CanDeal DNA Consensus OIS and Swap Rates will be available via LSEG Data &amp; Analytics under a global free-trial period until January 1, 2025. Thereafter, the products will become fee liable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal is the premier service for Canadian fixed income and interest rate derivatives data. This extension of our partnership will enable our clients to derive additional value through access to the Consensus OIS and Swap Rates,&rdquo; said Debbie Lawrence, Group Head of Data Strategy and Management at LSEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cessation of the CDOR benchmark has been a turning point for the financial industry,&rdquo; said Andre Craig, President of CanDeal DNA, a division of CanDeal Group, a leading provider of an electronic marketplace and data services for Canadian dollar debt securities and derivatives. &ldquo;In addition to collaborating with CanDeal Benchmark Solutions and market stakeholders to launch the forward-looking Term CORRA benchmark this past year, we are honored to continue to partner with the industry and with LSEG Data &amp; Analytics to introduce the Consensus OIS and Swap Curves and provide deeper transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside their award-winning Reference Pricing Service, CanDeal DNA provides intraday and real-time pricing for Canadian fixed income securities, advanced and regulatory analytics, security master, and curves solutions.</p>

<title>ICE Introduces Multi-Asset Class Climate Transition Risk Solution - Holistic Emissions Data Now Available For Municipal Bonds, Mortgage-Backed Securities And Real Estate, As Well As Corporate And Sovereign Bonds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of a multi-asset class climate transition risk solution, which provides emissions estimates and portfolio analytics across various fixed income asset classes, covering Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and real estate. This new solution, combined with ICE&rsquo;s existing coverage of sovereign, corporate equity, and private companies, can enable clients to assess and benchmark their financed emissions across a comprehensive range of fixed income asset classes in one integrated offering.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s new multi-asset class transition risk solution addresses gaps in emissions data by covering underserved sub-asset classes, such as RMBS, CMBS, and private corporates. By integrating this data, ICE can provide a unified portfolio metric that tracks financed emissions across multiple asset classes, supporting climate risk reporting, ensuring a holistic portfolio coverage from a physical and transition risk standpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our clients increasingly need quality transition risk data for underserved segments, particularly mortgage-backed securities, where we have applied physics-based simulations with building energy models and ICE&rsquo;s data to provide emissions insights for RMBS and CMBS,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Head of ICE Climate. &ldquo;Mortgages and mortgage securities can represent more than 20 percent of bank balance sheets, leading to a growing need for data to help meet regulatory disclosure and support stress testing to inform decision-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s multi-asset class transition risk solution provides PCAF-aligned (<a href="https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/about" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials</a>) financed emissions data, encompassing over 110 million US properties and more than 4.2 million fixed income securities globally. With this solution, clients can leverage advanced portfolio analytics to evaluate total emissions across multi-asset class portfolios, assisting clients in transition risk strategies. ICE&rsquo;s methodologies, customized for each asset class, provide comprehensive emissions tracking, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 estimates, as well as carbon intensity metrics, essential to meet climate regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>This new solution is part of the company&rsquo;s climate data offering, which provides data and analytics that help quantify investment impacts posed by transition risks as well as physical climate risks, such as extreme weather events.</p>
