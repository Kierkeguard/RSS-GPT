<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding QUIA PHARMA AB (publ)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that QUIA PHARMA AB (publ) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of five annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 625,000.</p>
<p><span>On January 17, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a letter of intent with Net Zero Infrastructure PLC (&ldquo;NZI&rdquo;) regarding the licensing of the Company&rsquo;s intellectual property. The press release included a reference to the fact that the information was such that the Company was obliged to disclose it under the EU Market Abuse Regulation (&ldquo;MAR&rdquo;). The Disciplinary Committee noted that it had already become clear at an early stage that there was significant uncertainty about whether NZI had the financial means to fulfill the licensing agreement that the Company and NZI were to negotiate. According to the Disciplinary Committee, information about NZI&rsquo;s financial conditions was necessary to enable a complete and correct assessment and should have been disclosed by the Company according to Article 17.1 of MAR. The Company did not do this and has thus violated Article 17.1 of MAR and item 4.1.1 of the Rulebook.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case, the Exchange had argued that the Company had in several serious respects violated the Rulebook in a manner that was likely to damage public confidence in the Exchange, First North Growth Market, and the securities market in general. The Exchange had requested that the Disciplinary Committee decide to delist the Company&rsquo;s shares.</span></p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee has found that the Company has violated Article 17.1 of MAR and thereby item 4.1.1 of the Rulebook in one respect. The Disciplinary Committee considers the violation to be serious, and therefore a fine shall be imposed. In relation to the other violations of the Rulebook alleged by the Exchange, the Disciplinary Committee notes that the Company&rsquo;s information disclosure and actions collectively deserve criticism, but that the Company, based on evidence presented in the case and given the design of the Rulebook, cannot be considered to have violated the Rulebook in most respects as alleged by the Exchange. Against this background, the Disciplinary Committee orders the Company to pay a fine to Nasdaq Stockholm equivalent to five annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported record total trading volume for the month of March 2025 of $59.6 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-march-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$59.6-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.71-trillion#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was a record $2.71tn, an increase of 49.9 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). For the first quarter of 2025, total trading volume was a record $164.5tn and ADV was a record $2.55tn, an increase of 33.7% YoY, with preliminary average variable fees per million dollars of volume traded of $2.31 and total preliminary fixed fees for rates, credit, equities and money markets of $85.1 million (mm)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-march-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$59.6-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.71-trillion#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>. Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of March was up 34.8% YoY and total ADV for the first quarter of 2025 was up 19.1% YoY.</p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: &ldquo;Electronic trading remained sticky and resilient across asset classes on Tradeweb, as market share gains and heightened market volatility helped drive record volume for the month of March and for the first quarter."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Record Highlights</span></strong></p>
<p>For the month of March 2025, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />March 2025 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>rates</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 30.0% YoY to $249.3 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 27.6% YoY to $63.4bn. 
<ul>
<li>Strong U.S. Treasuries ADV was led by record activity across the institutional client channel and robust activity across the wholesale client channel. Record European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes across our institutional client channel supported by a busy primary market, as well as heightened volatility in Europe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 15.3% YoY to $235.2bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by robust roll volumes and increased trading activity from hedge fund accounts. Tradeweb&rsquo;s specified pool platform reported strong volumes driven by a record number of clients executing on the platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 44.8% YoY to $592.0bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 49.2% YoY to $1.01tn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Record swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year activity was driven by evolving U.S. and global tariff policies, as well as global uncertainty surrounding financial markets. Volumes were supported by a 34% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a relatively lower fee per million. 1Q25 compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was higher than 4Q24.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>credit</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 26.6% YoY to $9.5bn and European credit ADV was up 14.0% YoY to $3.1bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably request-for-quote (RFQ) and Portfolio Trading. Tradeweb captured 18.4% and 7.6% of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. Record European credit volumes were driven by increased volume across all our protocols, including record volume in Portfolio Trading, Tradeweb&rsquo;s Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 31.0% YoY to $425mm. 
<ul>
<li>Municipal bond volumes saw growth across the retail and institutional platforms, outpacing the broader market, which was up approximately 17% YoY<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-march-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$59.6-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.71-trillion#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was up 72.2% YoY to&nbsp;$61.2bn. 
<ul>
<li>Increased hedge fund and systematic account activity YoY, along with heightened credit volatility, led to increased swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity. The semiannual index roll attributed to a spike in volume on Tradeweb SEF and MTF as participants rolled their CDS positions to the current series.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>equities&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was down 3.4% YoY to $10.1bn and European ETF ADV was up 35.6% YoY to $4.1bn. 
<ul>
<li>Volumes across Tradeweb&rsquo;s U.S. and European institutional platforms were up 41% and 36% YoY, respectively, as more clients rebalanced their portfolios in response to market volatility. In the U.S., total volumes were offset by lower wholesale volumes YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>money markets</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 28.6% YoY to $741.3bn. 
<ul>
<li>Record global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., strong growth was driven by the unwinding of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet, combined with balances remaining low at the reverse repo facility. In Europe, strong activity was driven by continued volatility in markets due to significant U.S. and German policy shifts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was up YoY to $296.3bn. 
<ul>
<li>Other money markets volume growth was driven by the inclusion of ICD volumes in March 2025.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">1: Welcome / introductions</h3>
<p>The Chair welcomed the Group and those present as part of the observers programme.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">2: Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion</h3>
<p>DE&amp;I remains a priority for the meeting, ensuring that the initiatives which are in place receive continued support. Members were encouraged to participate in the observers programme and consider future knowledge sharing topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">3: Retrospective review of market conditions</h3>
<p>The SONIA to Bank Rate wedge has narrowed slightly to ~4.5bps below Bank Rate following January 2025 month end. The rate first moved at year-end ending an 8-month long period of flatlining, followed by some further fluctuation in January 2025 and has since exhibited low levels of volatility &ndash; in line with what was observed pre-flatlining. The progressive move from excess reserves to abundant reserves through quantitative tightening, has led to some upward pressure in the rate.</p>
<p>Movement in volume has remained within the normal range, following typical patterns through the period and volume has remained robust.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">4: The Bank&rsquo;s facilities and how they are changing in a demand-driven repo-led framework</h3>
<p>Bank staff provided an overview of the Bank&rsquo;s facilities and noted the responses to December&rsquo;s discussion paper on the demand-driven repo-led framework for supplying reserves, would be published in due course. The Group noted the Bank&rsquo;s positive communications were effective in removing stigma around use of the Bank&rsquo;s facilities, which had encouraged market participants to consider these facilities as part of their funding toolkit. Members discussed the positive trend in use of facilities, including the Short-Term Repo and Indexed Long-Term Repo facilities.</p>
<p>Bank staff highlighted to the Group, that the Contingent Non-Bank Financial Institution Repo Facility was open for applications. The facility is designed to support eligible firms in periods of severe dysfunction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4"><strong>5: Looking ahead &ndash; comments on future notable changes</strong><a id="_Hlk153369683"></a></h3>
<p>Members discussed continuing liquidity draining, and the impact on SONIA as the market approaches the Preferred Minimum Range of Reserves. The SONIA-Bank Rate wedge was last at similar levels in 2020, when reserves were close to the current outstanding amounts.</p>
<p>The Group noted the supply and demand dynamics in secured and unsecured money market instruments and the low volatility in SONIA versus repo rates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5"><strong>6: Liquidity in SONIA derivatives markets</strong></h3>
<p>The positive growth trend in SONIA derivatives markets has continued, as volume and open interest reached new highs in February, in both futures and options. SONIA futures notional is now double that of LIBOR futures. Derivatives volume is now higher than pre-LIBOR transition as more investors allocate capital to the UK market.</p>
<p>Members discussed use of MPC dated SONIA futures, which has recently seen increasing demand.</p>
<p>The Group noted the confirmation from the Office for National Statistics, that their economic data releases would continue to be published at 7am and welcomed the opportunity for review in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6"><strong>7: SSAG Knowledge sharing</strong></h3>
<p>HSBC provided an overview of cross-currency basis and impact on SONIA. The Group noted the drivers of cross-currency basis and the impact seen in sterling money markets. In addition, members discussed the interlinkages between global financial markets, how changing basis reflects investor demand for US dollars and domestic currency pairs, what this indicates in terms of market functioning and macro-economic conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7"><strong>8: Real time gross settlement operating hours</strong></h3>
<p>Bank staff provided an update on the Bank&rsquo;s progress in delivering a renewed Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and proposed extension of operating hours. Last year the Bank had published a discussion paper &ldquo;Exploring longer operating hours for RTGS&rdquo; together with a summary of responses. The paper outlined the initial analysis, costs and benefits of extending operating hours. A formal public consultation on a proposal for RTGS and CHAPS operating hours is due later this year.</p>
<p>The extension of operating hours aims to support innovation in the UK financial system, reduce cross-border frictions in payments and leverage the technical capabilities of the renewed RTGS service. The Group discussed the potential impact on SONIA and how market behaviour might change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-8"><strong>9: AOB</strong></h3>
<p>No further business was discussed.</p>

<li><b><i>Strong Finish to 1Q25 Driven by Record Total Credit ADV in March 2025, Up 20%</i></b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><i>Record Total Portfolio Trading ADV in March 2025 and 1Q25</i></b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;"><i>Record Levels of Block Trading in Emerging Markets and Eurobonds in 1Q25</i></b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for March 2025 and the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:<br /></b>&ldquo;Our&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;trading results in March, combined with the progress we are seeing from the enhancements we have made to our portfolio trading solution, the launch of our High Touch block trading solution in eurobonds and emerging markets, and our dealer solutions offering, helped drive our&nbsp;<b>record&nbsp;</b>1Q25 ADV performance. We generated&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;1Q25 total ADV on&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;ADV across most of our product areas, which included&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;portfolio trading ADV and&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;block trading ADV across both emerging markets and eurobonds. We also generated&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;Dealer RFQ ADV, driven in part by improving market share of this important channel. We are encouraged by the increase in volatility in the markets and&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;levels of Open Trading activity on our platform, which helped drive improved estimated market share in March relative to February. We believe the new capabilities we have launched, combined with continued volatility in the market, should help drive higher levels of market share in U.S. credit in the coming quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Records for March and First Quarter 2025</b></p>

<li>The year-over-year decline in March 2025 total credit FPM was due to product and protocol mix. The month-over-month decline in March 2025 total credit FPM was due to product mix, principally the lower duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade, driven by a decrease in the weighted average years to maturity. The decline in 1Q25 total credit FPM both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was principally due to product mix.</li>
<li>The decrease in March 2025 total rates FPM year-over-year and the month-over-month increase was driven by the impact of product mix. The decrease in 1Q25 total rates FPM year-over-year and the slight increase quarter-over-quarter was also driven by the impact of product mix.</li>

<title>Puro.earth Opens Public Consultation For Biochar Methodology Update</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/puroearth-opens-public-consultation-for-biochar-methodology-update-202544/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/puroearth-opens-public-consultation-for-biochar-methodology-update-202544/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Puro.earth, the world's leading carbon crediting platform focused exclusively on carbon removal, today announced the opening of a public consultation process to update its pioneering Biochar Methodology. The three-week consultation  begins today and runs through April 24, 2025, allowing stakeholders from across the carbon removal ecosystem to provide input on proposed revisions to one of the market's most established frameworks for biochar carbon credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First developed in 2019 and previously updated in 2022, the Puro Standard Biochar Methodology has played a crucial role in enabling biochar producers worldwide to generate verified carbon removal credits. The upcoming revision aims to incorporate the latest  scientific research, strengthen environmental safeguards, and potentially extend the methodology's permanence framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The updated methodology is expected to strengthen several key aspects:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="elementToProof">Revised permanence considerations, extending beyond the current 100-year timeframe to 200 years&nbsp;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="elementToProof">Additional safeguards for sustainable biomass sourcing&nbsp;</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="elementToProof">Expanded eligibility criteria for various biochar production technologies&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div class="elementToProof"></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Biochar continues to be a cornerstone of the durable carbon removal market. By heating biomass at high temperatures without oxygen, biochar production creates a stable form of carbon that resists decomposition for centuries when applied to soil or used in other  applications. The process not only removes CO2 from the atmosphere but can also enhance soil health and provide waste management solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Puro.earth invites biochar producers, scientific experts, carbon credit buyers, policy specialists, and other stakeholders to participate in the consultation process. Feedback forms and detailed consultation documents are now available on the Puro.earth website.  Interested parties are encouraged to submit their comments before the April 24 deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about the biochar methodology update or to register interest in participating in the consultation, please visit <span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc Hyperlink SCXW184620554 BCX0 OWAAutoLink" href="http://www.puro.earth/" id="OWA3b23acf9-e18a-0e81-8449-516431bf0b12" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.puro.earth</a></span></span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insights from the FMA&rsquo;s review of fair conduct programmes received from financial institutions ahead of the commencement of the CoFI regime.</p>

<h3>Foreword from Michael Hewes, FMA Director Deposit Taking, Insurance and Advice</h3>
<p><img class="leftAlone ss-htmleditorfield-file image img-responsive" height="399" src="https://www.fma.govt.nz/assets/images/FMA-people/Executive-team/Michael-Hewes__ResizedImageWzcxMCwzOTld.webp" title="Michael Hewes, FMA Director Deposit Taking, Insurance and Advice" width="710" /></p>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko (FMA) was established with the overarching statutory objective of promoting fair, efficient, and transparent financial markets. The Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment Act 2022 (CoFI) expands the FMA&rsquo;s mandate as a conduct regulator and strengthens consumer protection by requiring financial institutions to prioritise the fair treatment of consumers.</p>
<p>CoFI requires financial institutions to be licensed by the FMA, and to establish, implement, maintain and comply with an effective fair conduct programme (FCP). An FCP means policies, processes, systems and controls that are designed to ensure the financial institution&rsquo;s compliance with the fair conduct principle, which is that financial institutions must treat consumers fairly.</p>
<p>While some financial institutions hold other market service licences issued by the FMA and therefore have experience engaging with the FMA, we acknowledge this will be new to others. We are committed to open, collaborative relationships to support fair consumer treatment. Over the past two years we have supported financial institutions in obtaining their licences and preparing for the new regime. We have published guidance, met with financial institutions individually, and engaged with the wider sector in-person and through online webinars and roundtables.</p>
<p>Financial institutions are a diverse population with different business structures, consumers, products and services. CoFI is designed as a principles-based regime, which gives financial institutions the flexibility to design an FCP that fits their business model. For this report, we have reviewed FCPs from a range of entities that vary in size, product offering and consumer profile. We believe that all financial institutions can learn from these insights. Our aim by sharing insights early&nbsp;in the regime is to assist financial institutions to continuously improve their FCPs and their approach to fair consumer treatment.</p>
<p>Encouragingly, we saw that many financial institutions have taken a comprehensive approach to the development of their FCPs, ensuring they align with their business nature, size, complexity and risk profile. Some have gone beyond the minimum requirements to build comprehensive, consumer-focused practices. This report spotlights some of these examples of good practice, as well as evolving areas of risk we think all financial institutions should consider as the financial services landscape evolves.</p>
<p>In these first years of the regime, we will continue to take an educative and collaborative regulatory approach, supporting financial institutions as they refine and strengthen their approach to fair consumer treatment. We also intend to undertake a more in-depth review of FCPs and share findings supported by evidence of how the programmes have functioned in action. We encourage financial institutions to build on the good work they have been doing, think beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements, and foster a culture that actively identifies, monitors and manages current and evolving risks associated with fair conduct.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Files Civil Proceedings Against IAG For Fair Dealing Breaches</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-iag-for-202544/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-iag-for-202544/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has filed a civil proceeding against insurer IAG New Zealand Limited (IAG) for fair dealing breaches in relation to its insurance products. The proceeding has eight causes of action relating to 11 alleged breaches of section 22, under Part 2 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) - false or misleading representations.</p>
<p>The breaches arise from IAG&rsquo;s failures to correctly price the premiums charged to customers, and its failures to correctly advertise and apply important discounts to its insurance products sold via its business divisions and distribution partners.</p>
<p>IAG self-reported the issues following the FMA&rsquo;s Conduct and Culture reviews of banks, life insurers, and fire and general insurers.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement, Margot Gatland, said: &ldquo;The scale of IAG&rsquo;s fair dealing breaches is extensive, impacting its core business. IAG is New Zealand&rsquo;s largest general insurer, including in the personal lines insurance market. Its distribution model relies on its brands and distribution partners, which reinforces the importance of the reliability of its systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IAG&rsquo;s exemplary conduct in response to the FMA&rsquo;s investigation must also be acknowledged.&nbsp; IAG&rsquo;s self-reporting was followed by its very early admission of liability, and its full cooperation including its commitment to an undefended proceeding.&nbsp; IAG worked closely with the FMA by way of proactive assistance in support of the efficiency of the investigation, in addition to providing regular updates as to its full customer remediation and its significant system upgrades designed to prevent further breaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the issues date back more than 20 years, however, the FMA&rsquo;s claim is limited to conduct from the introduction of the FMCA, which came into effect from April 2014. Approximately 269,000 customers were affected by the pleaded breaches, resulting in overcharges of approximately $35 million, with net gain to IAG of approximately $31.1 million.</p>
<p>The proceedings were filed in the High Court in Auckland.</p>
<p>Each cause of action can be found in the notes section below.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The eight pleaded causes of action address the following issues:</p>
<p>ASB multi policy discount issue</p>
<p>IAG inconsistently applied advertised multi policy discounts to customers who had purchased two or more of its ASB-branded policies.&nbsp; As a result, some eligible customers were overcharged premiums. Some customers holding caravan and trailer policies were also incorrectly advised that they were eligible for the MPD when they were not.</p>
<p>No Claims Bonus issue</p>
<p>Some customers entitled to a no claims bonus did not have the discount applied as intended, leading to premium overcharges. Some AMI customers also lost their entitlement to make two at fault claims per annum without impacting their no claims bonus.</p>
<p>Relatedly, when changes were made to some Westpac customers&rsquo; no claims bonus status, due to a systems error they were charged higher premium amounts than they had been quoted and invoiced.</p>
<p>Westpac Owner Occupier Discount issue</p>
<p>IAG customers with Westpac-branded policies for their owner-occupier home were entitled to a discount on any Motor Vehicle, Contents and Boat policies they also held.&nbsp; This was inconsistently applied.&nbsp; As a result, some eligible customers did not receive the discount.</p>
<p>Minimum Premium issue</p>
<p>Certain IAG Home, Contents, Vehicle and Boat policies were subject to a minimum premium applied via IAG&rsquo;s pricing algorithms, which unintentionally prevented some customers from receiving some or all of the discounts otherwise available on their policies.</p>
<p>BNZ/Co-Op Multi Policy Discount issue</p>
<p>IAG customers with BNZ and Co-Op-branded Contents policies and at least one other Home or Motor policy from the same brand were entitled to a multi policy discount.&nbsp; Some eligible customers did not receive the discount, due to it being inconsistently applied. The eligibility criteria were also misrepresented on Co-Op&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Multi-Dwelling issue</p>
<p>The number of dwellings insured on ASB and AMI Home policies determined the amount of Earthquake Commission (EC) and Fire Emergency NZ (FENZ) levies payable by the customers and impacts the premiums payable by AMI customers who added an extension to their policies. Due to errors as to the number of dwellings to be insured, some customers were overcharged EC/FENZ levies and AMI premiums.</p>
<p>Non-Optional Extension issue</p>
<p>BNZ and Co-Op-branded IAG Home policies included a non-optional extension for glass breakage. The cost of the non-optional extensions should have been included in the premium amount to which any available discounts were applied. IAG&rsquo;s pricing algorithm instead treated them as optional extensions to which discounts did not apply, resulting in overcharges.</p>
<p>High Value and Tesla Vehicle Multi-Policy Discount issue</p>
<p>IAG&rsquo;s representations conveyed that customers holding High Value and Tesla vehicle policies were entitled to a multi-policy discount on their premium in accordance the orthodox rules, when in fact different eligibility rules applied. Accordingly, some of those customers did not receive a multi policy discount in accordance with IAG&rsquo;s representations.</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s publicly available datasets comprise a central pillar of our economic infrastructure.</li>
<li>They facilitate commerce and consumer financial activity, promote corporate transparency and accountability &ndash; and build trust between participants in our financial system.</li>
<li>The improvements we are making to these will help uphold the value and trust placed in this precious national asset.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4zopxrdz/kate-orourke-portrait.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=500" /></p>
<p>Thank you very much. It&rsquo;s lovely to be here, everybody &ndash; and good afternoon.</p>
<p>I would like to start by acknowledging that we are on Ngunnawal country &ndash; and I pay my respects to Elders past and present, and to any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me as part of the conference. I&rsquo;m here on behalf of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission &ndash; and we are Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator.</p>
<p>You probably mainly read about us in the news for our regulatory or enforcement activities. But today I want to focus on another important part of what ASIC does &ndash; and that&rsquo;s in relation to the stewardship that we have of an expansive collection of publicly accessible databases.</p>
<p>I want to spend some time explaining to you what these databases are and how they comprise a central pillar of Australia&rsquo;s economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>I can think of no more fitting a place to talk about this than our nation&rsquo;s capital. Because I do think of these databases as a national asset &ndash; and here we&rsquo;re surrounded by national assets. We've got Parliament House, the High Court and the National Library.</p>
<p>Our national asset isn&rsquo;t visible, it&rsquo;s digital. But, like these other monuments, it's a testament to the Australian economy, how we run it and some of our values &ndash; and the way our economy thrives.</p>
<p>So, like I say, ASIC&rsquo;s data assets are less tangible, but I hope by the end of my presentation you can see just how valuable they are.</p>
<p>I will focus particularly on their value for government agencies because a lot of you here are from government agencies. But I&rsquo;ll also step through their value for commerce, for businesses and also for consumers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact of their public accessibility that makes these assets very valuable. A lot of agencies have closed databases. But the databases I am going to be talking about today are publicly accessible.</p>
<p>So, these datasets have that role of facilitating commerce and consumer activity &ndash; and promoting corporate transparency and accountability. I mention that, because that leads to trust &ndash; and trust is the foundation on which our economy &ndash; and government services &ndash; are built.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s publicly accessible datasets</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start by focusing on the ASIC companies and business names registers. But there are actually a lot of others as well. There&rsquo;s a real depth and diversity.</p>
<p>So, as you can see from this&nbsp;<a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/5e4pymn2/snapshot-only-asic-s-key-publicly-accessible-datasets.pdf" title="Snapshot Only ASIC&rsquo;S Key Publicly Accessible Datasets">slide</a><sup><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/leveraging-data-for-consumer-protection-and-to-support-australian-businesses/#fn1">[1]</a><a id="fnref1"></a></sup><span>, we've got a lot of databases. They&rsquo;re varied &ndash; and each of them contains a wealth of information that can give meaningful insights into the health of our economy.</span></p>
<h3>Registry datasets</h3>
<p>To sample some of these intangible treasures, we'll start with the Registry datasets.</p>
<p>ASIC administers 32 registers &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll see these on the slide under the Registry heading. They&rsquo;re the official source of information about companies, business names, and people and organisations who are registered or licensed to operate financial services businesses in Australia.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, we had 343 million searches across these registers. In the same period, we had 3.1 million updates, and more than 303,000 new companies and 386,000 new business names were registered. So, they&rsquo;re busy registers.</p>
<p>The largest of our registers is the&nbsp;<strong>Australian Companies Register&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; and it contains both current and historical information in relation to 3.39 million companies. So, this is the real beating heart of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>On this register we have company status and type, as well as the company&rsquo;s directors and officeholders. The information about the people who lead companies includes their names, addresses and other information. We also have share structure, ultimate holding company and a list of publicly accessible documents lodged.</p>
<p>Some companies &ndash; not all of them, certainly not all 3.39 million of them &ndash; need to lodge financial reports with us, depending on their size. So, some additional financial information is available for some companies.</p>
<p>The second in size is the&nbsp;<strong>Business Names Register</strong>&nbsp;with 2.84 million entries. Similarly, you can get publicly accessible information there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next category is the&nbsp;<strong>professional registers</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; much smaller in size, but really important as a means of facilitating financial services in Australia.</p>
<p>These registers capture the people and firms who give you financial advice, AFSLs (Australian Financial Services licensees), credit, auditors, liquidators &ndash; a lot of the professional and financial services in our economy.</p>
<p>So, people use these &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll come to some examples later &ndash; if they&rsquo;re trying to find, for example, a financial adviser.</p>
<p>There's a long list of datasets on the slide under&nbsp;<strong>banned and disqualified</strong>. So, they're who you don't want to be engaging for financial services or otherwise &ndash; and that's both people and organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other datasets</h3>
<p>On the other column on this first slide, we&rsquo;ve got our non-Registry datasets &ndash; and, at the top there, insolvency.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll often see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/statistics/insolvency-statistics/">insolvency statistics</a>&nbsp;from ASIC that are quoted when people are talking about the health of the economy &ndash; or particular sectors or geographies. They really are an important indicator of the health of an economy &ndash; and in identifying pressure points as well.</p>
<p>We release corporate insolvencies statistics weekly (two weeks in arrears). So, it&rsquo;s pretty current data &ndash; and there are some commentators and, indeed, economists who look really closely at that information.</p>
<p>We also publish lists from registered liquidators &ndash; quarterly and annual statistics about liquidations that we get from the reports that registered liquidators send to us.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://publishednotices.asic.gov.au/">published notices website</a>&nbsp;has over one million hits a year and that's around company deregistrations and external administrations.</p>
<p>The enforcement-related datasets include the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/other-registers/court-enforceable-undertakings-register/">Court Enforceable Undertakings Register</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/other-registers/infringement-notices-register/">Infringement Notices Register</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/markets-disciplinary-panel/mdp-outcomes-register/#:~:text=This%20register%20contains%20details%20of,be%20published%20on%20the%20register.">Markets Disciplinary Panel Outcomes Register</a>.</p>
<p>On markets, there's quite a long list. I'm not sure if we've got any market specialists here. These contain really granular data. For example the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/short-selling/short-position-reports-table/">short position reports table</a>&nbsp;and quarterly&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/market-structure/equity-market-data/">equity market data</a>. Because ASIC is the markets regulator as well.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, we've got many consumer-facing datasets such as our&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/investor-alert-list">investor alert list</a>. So that's entities and websites that we think are a scam or otherwise untrustworthy.</p>
<p>We also have&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/other-registers/public-warning-notices/">public warning notices</a>&nbsp;about conduct in relation to financial services.</p>
<p>The last one to mention is what we call our&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/find-unclaimed-money">unclaimed money search</a>&nbsp;&ndash; through Moneysmart. There&rsquo;s around $2 billion in lost shares, bank accounts and life insurance &ndash; and the unclaimed money search is the avenue through which you go to see if you've got money owed. Some of you might go and have a look later. There might be some money to be claimed there.</p>
<p>We had 12 million visits to our Moneysmart site in 2024, with 1.2 million going to the unclaimed money search particularly.</p>
<h3>How these datasets are being accessed, their users and uses</h3>
<p>I'm going to move now to discuss how these databases are accessed, who the key users are and their uses.</p>
<p>So, beyond checking for a possible windfall, what other value do these datasets bring?</p>
<p>As you can see from this next slide, we can group our users into three main categories: government and government agencies; companies and businesses; and consumers and the community.</p>
<p>In terms of access, there's a couple of different ways in. We&rsquo;ve got the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/">ASIC website</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx">ASIC Connect</a>&nbsp;portal, the&nbsp;<a href="https://service.asic.gov.au/search/">ASIC Professional Registers Search</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://publishednotices.asic.gov.au/">published notices website</a>&nbsp;and there&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://data.gov.au/home">data.gov.au</a>, which directs to some of the ASIC data as well.</p>
<p>Then there are means by which people can receive regular updates. If you have an interest in a specific company, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/online-services-information-and-support/using-the-company-alert-service/">get email notifications</a>&nbsp;from us, if the company lodges a document, for example. We also have company notices in our&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/corporate-publications/asic-gazette/">gazettes</a>.</p>
<p>Others with more complex requirements &ndash; so for large volumes of data &ndash; can engage an ASIC-approved&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/other-registers/information-brokers/">information broker</a>. They have the capacity to retrieve really big chunks of data from our registers &ndash; and also from other government agencies. Then there can be insights drawn from the combined datasets.</p>
<h3>Government and government agencies</h3>
<p>So, homing in particularly on government and government agencies.</p>
<p>We share Registry data with about 80 federal, state and local agencies. So, some of you here might be regular consumers of our data.</p>
<p>This is often sent as a series of bulk data files, that are extracted from the registers. That's, of course, depending on the agency&rsquo;s needs. Then they can load it up and do the analytics to filter, search and match.</p>
<p>This is used for regulatory purposes, enforcement purposes, to support investigations or indeed for statistical purposes. It may have implications for national security. So, in the detection and disruption of serious financial crime, ASIC data often is an important component of that work.</p>
<p>In terms of data analytics &ndash; how the datasets are interpreted to extract those actionable insights &ndash; there are hundreds of examples. But one is the ATO, who use our data to look for non-compliance across a range of different areas &ndash; including director ID.</p>
<p>ASIC too uses its own datasets &ndash; these ones as well as internal ones &ndash; for regulatory and enforcement purposes. For example, we&rsquo;ve used the ASIC registers to interrogate the legitimacy of a series of companies we think are linked to international scam syndicates.</p>
<p>So, something that a lot of people across both Commonwealth and other agencies are fighting is scams &ndash; and we've been able to use Registry data as part of those efforts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using machine learning and advanced analytics for some time. We haven't yet focused this as much on our Registry data, but we can see opportunities in that space.</p>
<p>We also are exploring the use of artificial intelligence to assess the high volumes of reports of misconduct and reportable situations that we receive. So, we&rsquo;re really looking for financial harms. Then we can take regulatory or enforcement action &ndash;&nbsp;and scams is a good example.</p>
<h3>Companies and businesses&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Turning to the second of our user groups: companies and businesses.</p>
<p>The first thing to note about the registers is that they're actually the basis on which a company comes to be. To be registered is to get company status or business name status. For companies that allows for limited liability and all the good things that flow from that, as the primary corporate form in our economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, also, the registers are really important as a means of performing due diligence.</p>
<p>If a company wants to contract with another, you need to know it exists. So before entering commercial arrangements or engaging professional services, our registers are frequently searched.</p>
<p>Similarly for loans and access to credit, banks and lenders access our datasets to inform lending decisions &ndash; and commercial credit agencies use our data all the time as well.</p>
<h3>Consumers and the community</h3>
<p>The third user group is consumers and the community.</p>
<p>I mentioned Moneysmart, but we've also got other datasets that support protection from financial fraud, scams and unlicensed entities.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/investor-alert-list">investor alert list</a>&nbsp;contains the details of domestic and international entities that we think are operating without a license or an exemption or are impostor entities, who impersonate proper corporate actors in our economy.</p>
<p>We update this list regularly. We have an associated activity, which is our investment scam website takedown work. That&rsquo;s a service whereby websites that we've identified as a scam get taken down.</p>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve got over 2,700 entries on our investor alert list.</p>
<p>Consumers use our datasets for due diligence as well. So, checking before they invest, finding out if someone&rsquo;s banned or otherwise, are ways that consumers can help protect themselves and make good financial decisions.</p>
<h3>Journalists</h3>
<p>A valuable subset of consumers and the community, who use our Registry data, are journalists. Smaller in number, but big in impact.</p>
<p>Since a legal change in 2019, journalists are&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/asic-portals/journalist-portal/">exempt</a>&nbsp;from certain Registry fees. I call this out, because it's another public interest basis for the Registry datasets.</p>
<p>So, the registers are really important, as part of the media in Australia.</p>
<h2>Improvements in the pipeline</h2>
<p>So that's what we've got and how it's used.</p>
<p>The third part of what I wanted to speak to you about this afternoon are some of the new things or changes that we've got planned in relation to these datasets.</p>
<h3>Adding new datasets</h3>
<p>The first thing to note is that we're adding a couple of new datasets.</p>
<p>The first to mention is&nbsp;<strong>internal dispute resolution (IDR) data</strong>. It sounds very specific. But financial services firms, those who have a financial services license, are required to have an internal dispute resolution function. In relation to that, they need to keep records of what complaints they&rsquo;ve had and how they&rsquo;ve resolved them.</p>
<p>One of the improvements that we've recently made is to get all that internal dispute resolution data coming more systematically through to ASIC. We've been building an IDR data reporting framework, so we can then publish it back to the community. There's been many years of work to record, improve and standardise that information.</p>
<p>So, like I said, the requirement to report applies to all financial firms. So far, we've been releasing that data in tranches at an aggregate level. There were 4.7 million reported complaints in 2023/24.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using that data for regulatory purposes and now what we're going to do is publish that on an entity-by-entity basis &ndash; so that there's increased transparency.</p>
<p>Exactly how we're going to publish it, we're going to consult on. I&rsquo;m sure many of you can appreciate exactly what that looks like. It can be quite granular and important.</p>
<p>That consultation process will commence soon. We're going to couple with it with a consultation on how we publish what we call reportable situations data, so that refers to breach reporting.</p>
<p>So again, financial services firms have to collect information, where they&rsquo;ve identified themselves that they've breached the law, and provide that to us.</p>
<h3>Enhancing existing datasets</h3>
<p>The second improvement is enhancing some of the existing datasets.</p>
<p>We really want the data we&rsquo;ve got to be robust and accessible &ndash; and we think there's definitely uplift available. Really, that's in light of just how many decisions are being made off the back of this information.</p>
<p>We also want to make it simpler for people to comply with their obligations in giving us information &ndash; and also in understanding it.</p>
<p>If we deliver a better experience for users, if there's greater automation or other ways of providing information or accessing it, that can improve consumer and corporate outcomes, but also regulatory outcomes as well.</p>
<p>We recognise the need for improvement to our public interfaces. We know that they're not particularly user-friendly and that can erode value and trust if we don't keep improving the datasets that we've got.</p>
<h3>RegistryConnect</h3>
<p>We're happy to say that we recently received funding for the next tranche of the program we call RegistryConnect &ndash; and that's really to continue to deliver reliable, secure, trusted and efficient Registry services to support the economy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that, while we have a lot of registers, there are others across the Commonwealth agencies. Particularly the ATO, who've got the director ID register and the Australian Business Register (ABR). For people in the room who&rsquo;ve got an ABN, you go to the ATO for that. So, we call it RegistryConnect because it's about bringing registers together as well &ndash; including across agencies.</p>
<p>There will be some heavy lifting for us in delivering the RegistryConnect program. But some of these efforts are well underway. We've got some old technology that we're stabilising. But we're also looking very much to improvements in the data and that's what I'll focus on here.</p>
<p>An immediate priority will be enhancing data quality and integrity. We've got situations where some of our data is fragmented or duplicated in relation, for example, to people. There are some inaccurate ABN linkages in the Companies Register and also fraudulent addresses. So, these are the things that we need to resolve.</p>
<p>There are also minor inaccuracies in people's names, dates of birth, addresses, initials, misspellings, those sorts of things. These are smaller issues, but still really important to get right.</p>
<p>We want to uplift that data, where we can. There are some legislative constraints on how much we can change what&rsquo;s been given to us. But within those, we are really keen to uplift the data.</p>
<p>We're going to be enhancing our processes for authentication and authorisation when people come in or on to the register. So that will also help prevent some of the errors and inaccuracies as it comes in and also help reduce fraudulent interactions.</p>
<p>I mentioned before the ATO. An important part of what we're doing is linking the data on director ID, which is in their register, with the Companies Register. So, at the moment, you'll have a company with the names of directors, but it doesn't yet have their numbers.</p>
<p>Bringing those two datasets together is a really important part of what we've just been given funding for. We call that director ID linking. That will move in time through to a process by which when a company is registered, they'll give us the director ID information then and we can also have a process for updating information about directors.</p>
<p>Lots of you will probably have a director ID &ndash; or some of you will. It's a unique identifier that people have for life.</p>
<p>By having it on the Companies Register, that will help ASIC and others identify director conflicts, patterns of common stewardship of corporate entities, histories of involvement either in successful companies or in insolvencies, poor business conduct and/or information around the types of companies people have been involved in &ndash; if they're making decisions about whether to contract with someone or use them as a financial services licensee, as I said before.</p>
<p>So, this will be great for us as a regulator &ndash; and an example might be detecting and disrupting insider trading. At the moment, we can see a director&rsquo;s history, but it takes an enormous amount of effort. This will be a much more straightforward opportunity for us. So, our work on illegal phoenixing or scams will be enhanced through this.</p>
<p>So, good for the regulator. But, we hope very much, good for the users as well, the people who have to input information, provide it or update it.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, it's not always user-friendly and we're working for it to be better for our users. We&rsquo;re trying to include validation at point of data input and collection. That will help people give the right information, right from the start &ndash; so there's less need for corrections.</p>
<p>So that's good for everybody, we think. For regulators. But also, for the people who are providing the information and, from our perspective, for the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still early days in the RegistryConnect program, where our focus has been on stabilising some of the technology. But we've got some fantastic plans in place and we&rsquo;re really looking forward to the improvements that I've described today.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So earlier, I referred to our publicly accessible datasets as a precious national asset &ndash; and it's hard to put a value on something that's intangible. But there are figures that we use to give a sense of what can be achieved.</p>
<p>One figure I&rsquo;d draw to your attention is $4.89 billion. That's the estimated annual impact of illegal phoenixing activity<sup><a id="fnref2"></a><a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/leveraging-data-for-consumer-protection-and-to-support-australian-businesses/#fn2">[2]</a></sup><span>. So, if we get better at identifying and addressing illegal phoenixing, there's a significant uplift for the economy and improved trust in the economy, as well, between people.</span></p>
<p>There's dozens of other metrics that we could use. But really, I think, the value here is in what people use it for. I hope in describing some of these datasets to you, you are interested in what ASIC has &ndash; and interested to explore some of these datasets.</p>
<p>So, I really hope that you explore and treasure this data &ndash; just like we do &ndash; and I'm keen to answer any questions that you have. Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. Ripoll. It is wonderful to be here at the University of Pittsburgh. I am honored to deliver the 2025 McKay Lecture in memory of Dr. Marion McKay, who led the economics department here for more than 30 years. I am especially humbled to have this opportunity, given the many significant contributors to the field of economics who have spoken in this series, including David Autor, Claudia Goldin, Bob Lucas, and Joe Stiglitz.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250403a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>I have been looking forward to this lecture for many months, because researching, discussing, and teaching economics have long been my favorite activities. I have been a professor for much longer than I have been a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, which I joined three years ago. Today, I would like to discuss my outlook for the economy and my views on the path of monetary policy. For this speech, I will also offer recent historical context about how the economy arrived in its current position, take some time to review some concepts in economics, and, finally, discuss my approach to monetary policy at a time of increasing uncertainty.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the U.S. economy has grown at a strong pace, supported by resilient consumer spending. Currently, I see the economy as being in a solid position, though American households, businesses, and investors are reporting heightened levels of uncertainty about both the direction of government policy and the economy. For instance, the Beige Book, a Fed report that compiles anecdotal information on economic conditions gathered from around the country, had 45 mentions of "uncertainty." That is the largest number of mentions of the word in the history of the Beige Book, up from 12 mentions a year ago. Consistent with elevated uncertainty, there are increasing signs that consumer spending and business investment are slowing. Inflation has come down considerably from its peak in 2022 but remains somewhat above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. The labor market appears to have stabilized, and there is a rough balance between available workers and the demand for labor. The unemployment rate remains low by historical standards.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's primary body for making monetary policy, raised interest rates sharply in 2022 and 2023 in response to elevated inflation. Then, amid progress on disinflation and a rebalancing labor market, last year my FOMC colleagues and I voted to make policy somewhat less restrictive. At our past two policy meetings, we held rates steady at 4.25 to 4.5 percent. Looking ahead, monetary policy will need to navigate the high degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook.</p>
<p><strong>Structure for Policymaking</strong><br />I will discuss the elements of my economic outlook in more detail in a moment. But first let me tell you a bit about how I structure my thinking related to monetary policy and the economy. The starting point for that exercise is always the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress, which has two goals: maximum employment and stable prices. Achieving those goals will result in the best economic outcomes for all Americans.</p>
<p>So, when I say "maximum employment," what do I mean? Maximum employment is the highest level of employment, or the lowest level of unemployment, the economy can sustain while maintaining a stable inflation rate. Unemployment has very painful consequences for individual workers and their families, including lower standards of living and greater incidence of poverty. In contrast, maintaining maximum employment for a sustained period results in many benefits and opportunities to families and communities that often had been left behind, including those in rural and urban communities and those with lower levels of education.</p>
<p>More broadly, having ample job opportunities typically results in a larger and more prosperous economy. It allows workers, a vital resource in the economy, to be deployed most productively. Maximizing employment promotes business investment and the economy's long-run growth potential. When people can enter the labor force and move to better and more productive positions, it fosters the development of more and better ideas and innovation.</p>
<p>How about "stable prices?" Like former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, I consider prices to be stable when shoppers and businesses do not have to worry about costs significantly rising or falling when making plans, such as whether to take out a loan or make an investment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250403a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Since 2012, the Fed has been explicit about the rate of inflation that constitutes price stability. An inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run is most consistent with the Fed's price-stability mandate. Price stability means avoiding prolonged periods of high inflation. We know that high inflation is particularly difficult on those who are least able to bear it. Moreover, high inflation may require a forceful monetary policy response, which can lead to bouts of higher unemployment. In contrast, price stability creates the conditions for a sustainable labor market.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Developments in the Pandemic Period</strong><br />With the backdrop of the Fed's dual-mandate goals, I would like to discuss the extraordinary developments that have occurred over the past five years, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reviewing that recent history is important context for understanding the current state of monetary policy. Before reviewing the data, it is important to recognize the tragic human suffering and loss of life the pandemic caused. That loss can never be fully described in numbers and charts. For today's discussion, I will describe the economic implications, which were profound and will likely be studied for decades.</p>
<p>When the global pandemic took hold in the spring of 2020, economies around the world shut down or sharply limited activity. This was especially true for in-person services, such as travel, dining out at restaurants, and trips to the barber shop or hair salon. I would like to turn your attention to the screen, where I will display some charts to better illustrate economic developments. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure1-20250403.JPG" id="fig2">figure 1</a>, you can see the sharp downturn in economic growth, followed by the subsequent recovery. At this time, it also became apparent that the economic effects of shutdowns in one part of the world were exacerbated by constrained supplies from other parts of the world. Global policymakers faced the common challenge of supporting incomes and limiting the negative effects of shutdowns, which, mercifully, were temporary. The initial policy response was largely uniform across developed economies. This generally included fiscal support from governments, particularly to help those most in need, although the magnitude differed across countries. Central banks set monetary policy with the aim to prevent a sharp financial and economic deterioration. Later, central banks extended accommodative policy to support the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve, specifically, cut its policy rate in the spring of 2020 to near zero and bought assets to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and to foster accommodative financial conditions. Establishing a low interest rate is intended to support spending and investment.</p>
<p>At the onset of the pandemic, a very deep but short contraction of economic activity occurred. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, tens of thousands of school districts sent students and teachers home, factories closed because of outbreaks, and the supply of many goods was disrupted. People also adjusted consumption patterns, rotating toward purchases of goods. Americans who canceled vacation plans and gym memberships sought to buy televisions, exercise equipment, and other goods. Demand for goods rose rapidly, but supply chains were unable to adjust at the same speed. This contributed to a global surge in inflation. That surge was followed by a further upswing in prices after February 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused a shock to global supplies of commodities, including food and energy.</p>
<p>At the start of 2022, inflation topped 6 percent, and by the middle of that year it reached a peak above 7 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250403a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;With inflation unacceptably high, Fed policymakers turned toward tightening. Take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure2-20250403.JPG" id="fig3">figure 2</a>. You can see that from March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed raised its policy rate 5‑1/4 percentage points. Those higher interest rates helped restrain aggregate demand, and the forceful response helped keep long-term inflation expectations well anchored.</p>
<p>The Fed's policy actions occurred alongside increases in aggregate supply. Global trade flows recovered from disruptions, and the availability of manufacturing inputs returned to pre-pandemic levels. U.S. labor supply recovered significantly in 2022 and 2023, boosted by rebounds in labor force participation and immigration.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure3-20250403.JPG" id="fig4">Figure 3</a>&nbsp;shows the rebound in labor force participation. Notice that workers aged 25 to 54, the dark orange line, led that gain. In response to rising rents, construction of multifamily housing picked up, helping counter shortages of available homes in some areas. The combination of increased supply and policy restraint contributed to a significant slowing of inflation. Notably, inflation came down without a painful increase in unemployment. This was a historically unusual, but most welcome, result.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity Gains</strong><br />In addition to increased supply and policy restraint, another factor allowed the U.S. economy to grow in recent years as inflation abated&mdash;a resurgence in productivity growth. Let's look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure4-20250403.JPG" id="fig5">figure 4</a>. Data through the end of last year indicate that labor productivity has grown at a 2 percent annual rate since the end of 2019, surpassing its 1.5 percent growth rate over the previous 12 years. As a result, the level of productivity, the blue line, has been higher than expected given the pre-pandemic trend, the dashed orange line.</p>
<p>Several forces likely supported productivity in recent years. New business formation in the U.S. has risen since the start of the pandemic. These newer firms are more likely to innovate and adopt new technologies and business processes, and this, in turn, can support productivity gains. As the economy reopened after pandemic shutdowns, workers took new jobs and moved to new locations, and the pace of job switching remained elevated for some time. That reallocation may have resulted in better and more productive matches between the skills of workers and their jobs, thus raising labor productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250403a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Labor shortages during the pandemic recovery also spurred businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies and to improve efficiency, which may have supplied at least a one-time boost to productivity.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, investment in new technologies may continue to support productivity growth. Much of this investment has gone toward artificial intelligence (AI). As I have discussed in previous speeches, I see AI, and generative AI in particular, as likely to become a general purpose technology, similar to the printing press and computer, that will spread throughout the economy and spark downstream innovation as well as continue to improve over time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250403a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;It holds the promise to increase the pace of idea generation, and each newly discovered idea could itself provide an incremental boost to productivity. In the longer run, I am optimistic about the potential for gains in total factor productivity growth from the growing integration of AI into business processes throughout the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />Now that I have reviewed the path of the economy over the past five years, I would like to present my near-term outlook for the economy in more detail. In the past year, overall economic activity and the labor market have been solid, while inflation has run somewhat above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.</p>
<p><em>Inflation</em><br />I will start with inflation, which you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure5-20250403.JPG" id="fig6">figure 5</a>. The most recent data show that inflation was 2.5 percent for the 12 months ending in February, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, shown in blue. This is a marked shift down from the peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022. The dark orange line shows that core PCE prices&mdash;which exclude the volatile food and energy categories&mdash;increased 2.8 percent in February, down from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022. Economists pay careful attention to core prices, as they are typically a better indicator of underlying inflation and the path of future inflation.</p>
<p>While the progress since 2022 has been notable, the decline in inflation over the past year has been slow and uneven. Prices for energy, including gasoline, have moderated. Food inflation has mostly stabilized over the past year, but it is still elevated for some grocery items. Let's look at the components of core inflation in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure6-20250403.JPG" id="fig7">figure 6</a>. You can see that housing services inflation, the dashed green line, remains high but has moderated steadily over the past two years, consistent with the past slowing in market rents.</p>
<p>Since we are talking about housing and the cost of renting, let me say a word about the data we use at the Federal Reserve. Most of the data I have presented thus far are carefully collected, analyzed, and released by federal government agencies, like the Bureau of Economic Analysis which collects data on GDP. But we use a wide variety of sources, including series generated by the private sector. Market rents&mdash;the cost many of you pay for your apartment&mdash;is a good example. Where do you think we get information on rents? From some of the same websites you would use to find an apartment. We use high-frequency data series from sources like those as inputs into a model of rents on new leases in real time. This turns out to be helpful in the timely determination of where rents are, because they show up with a lag in official measures of inflation.</p>
<p>Going back to figure 6, outside of housing, core services inflation, the dark orange line, has eased only a bit over the past year, held up by persistent inflation in restaurant meals, airline fares, and financial fees. Notably, goods prices outside of food and energy, the blue line, have increased recently after a period of decline associated with the resolution of pandemic-related supply disruptions. The recent rise in core goods prices may partly reflect sellers' anticipation that tariff increases could raise the cost of supplies.</p>
<p>Tariff increases typically result in an increase in the level of prices for the affected goods, which temporarily pushes up the overall inflation rate. But what matters for monetary policy would be a persistent boost to inflation. I am carefully watching various channels through which tariff effects could have more widespread implications for prices. Tariffs on steel and aluminum have already raised prices for those manufacturing inputs. As those cost increases work their way through the manufacturing process, they could boost prices of a range of goods over time. In the motor vehicle industry, those indirect effects, as well as direct tariffs on vehicles, could raise prices for new cars. That in turn could feed through to prices for used cars. And, as seen in recent years, higher prices for motor vehicles could, with a lag, raise costs for related services, such as rentals, insurance, and car repair.</p>
<p>Inflation expectations are another channel through which tariffs could affect inflation over time.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure7-20250403.JPG" id="fig8">Figure 7</a>&nbsp;shows the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers inflation expectation readings. It shows a large increase in one-year inflation expectations, the blue line, which is consistent with the cost of tariffs being largely passed through to prices. Indeed, many respondents mentioned tariffs as the reason for that rise. Moreover, businesses, including contacts in the Beige Book, also report that they expect to pass on the costs of tariffs to their customers. More worrisome is the uptick in longer-term inflation expectations, the dark orange line, which may be influenced by tariff concerns or the slow pace of disinflation.</p>
<p>However, I look at several measures of inflation expectations, including those derived from financial markets, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure8-20250403.JPG" id="fig9">figure 8</a>. Those measures show a significant rise in inflation compensation for this year, the blue line. However, reassuringly, there has been little increase in inflation compensation over the five years starting five years from now, the dark orange line. It will be important to watch closely those indicators of longer-term inflation expectations. If they were to rise substantially, it may become more difficult to keep actual inflation on a path back toward our 2 percent goal.</p>
<p><em>Labor Market</em><br />Now let's examine something I am sure some soon-to-be graduates here are monitoring: the labor market. Currently, the labor market does not appear to be a significant source of inflation pressure, as wage growth has continued to moderate. Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure9-20250403.JPG" id="fig10">figure 9</a>, you can see the Labor Department's employment cost index report showed that wages and salaries for private-sector workers rose at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. After rising during the post-pandemic recovery, wage growth has moved closer to a level consistent with moderate inflation. Moreover, the wage premium for job switchers over those staying in their jobs, a substantial contributor to wage growth early in the pandemic recovery, has largely disappeared, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Notably, wage gains continue to outpace inflation, consistent with other measures showing that the labor market remains in a solid position.</p>
<p>After a long period of normalization that began in 2022, the labor market appears to have stabilized since last summer. While hiring has slowed, layoffs continue to be low overall. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in February, remains historically low. Looking at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure10-20250403.JPG" id="fig11">figure 10</a>, you can see that the rate has held in a narrow range between 3.9 and 4.2 percent for the past year. Economists sometimes call the unemployment rate the U-3 series, as it is one of several measures of labor market slack. Employers added 200,000 jobs per month in the three months through February, a solid pace of job creation, although it is down from its post-pandemic peaks. Recent data show the labor market to be balanced. Take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure11-20250403.JPG" id="fig12">figure 11</a>. It shows the number of available jobs is about equal to the number of available workers. You can see that is much different from 2022, when vacancies were high relative to people looking for work. We will learn more details about the labor market tomorrow, when the March jobs report is released.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the headline labor market data, recent signals of softness have emerged and should be monitored.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure12-20250403.JPG" id="fig13">Figure 12</a>&nbsp;shows the number of workers with part-time jobs who want full-time jobs. Economists say these people are working "part time for economic reasons." The February jobs data showed a pickup in the number of workers in this category. This group is part of a broader measure of unemployment and underemployment, called the U-6 series. In addition, one measure of confidence in the labor market is the rate at which workers voluntarily quit their jobs. Take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure13-20250403.JPG" id="fig14">figure 13</a>. The quits rate was very high in 2022, when workers expected to be able to easily find a new job with higher wages. Now you can see that the quits rate has fallen to a more normal level. Consistent with that, surveys show that workers' perceptions of job availability have declined. Both measures are now below their levels from 2018 and 2019, before the pandemic, when the labor market was very strong.</p>
<p>We are also beginning to see ripples from cuts to federal jobs and funding. These cuts have affected federal workers across the entire country. Also affected are government contractors and universities, who have announced layoffs or hiring freezes amid cuts and pauses in federal research grants. Although the number of layoffs so far has been modest, the news and uncertainty have raised concerns about job security for households and consumer demand for businesses, as is evident in the Michigan survey and the Beige Book. The Federal Reserve produces the Beige Book before every FOMC meeting, and it provides a timely, useful narrative about the economy from all 12 districts to accompany the multitude of data we receive prior to FOMC meetings. This is recommended reading for all econ majors and anyone else interested in economic activity throughout the country.</p>
<p><em>Economic Activity</em><br />Overall, the U.S. economy entered the year in a solid position. Real GDP rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, extending a period of steady growth. Robust income growth and the wealth effect from several years of strong increases in asset prices boosted consumer outlays.</p>
<p>Data show that personal consumption spending slowed in the first two months of this year. Although some of the reduction in spending may be due to unseasonably bad weather, consumers appear to have less of a financial cushion now than in recent years, and they are more pessimistic about their labor-market and income prospects.</p>
<p>Businesses say that heightened uncertainty due to trade and other policies has hurt their plans for hiring and investment.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure14-20250403.JPG" id="fig15">Figure 14</a>&nbsp;shows a sizable increase in firms mentioning trade policy uncertainty on earnings calls in recent months. Some businesses, especially in construction, agriculture, senior care, and food services, are also concerned that a slowdown in immigration will reduce labor supply. In addition to survey data, businesses have expressed uncertainty in their forecasts, on earnings calls, and in other anecdotal reports.</p>
<p>Currently, my baseline forecast is that U.S. economic growth will slow moderately this year, with the unemployment rate picking up a bit, while inflation progress will stall in the near term, in part because of tariffs and other policy changes. Elevated and rising uncertainty, however, means that I am very attentive to scenarios that could be quite different from my baseline. It is possible that new policies could prove to be minimally disruptive and consumer demand could remain resilient, and overall growth may be stronger than anticipated. However, I currently place more weight on scenarios where risks are skewed to the upside for inflation and to the downside for growth. Such scenarios, with higher initial inflation and slower growth, could pose challenges for monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy at a Time of Uncertainty</strong><br />Now that I have explained my economic outlook, I would like to explore an important question at this moment: How should monetary policy be conducted during a time of heightened uncertainty? I believe one useful guide is the framework on optimal monetary policy decision making under uncertainty described by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke in 2007.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250403a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;He saw three areas of uncertainty relevant for policymakers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current state of the economy.</li>
<li>The structure of the economy.</li>
<li>The way in which private agents form expectations about future economic developments and policy actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us take those one by one.</p>
<p>So how do I seek clarity on the current state of the economy? As I have said since I first joined the Federal Reserve Board nearly three years ago, I think it is important to look at a wide range of data in judging the economy. Certainly, the key monthly and quarterly economic data releases are the gold standard, but I also find useful information in real-time data, surveys, and contacts with participants in the economy.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, the economic effects of widespread shutdowns were quickly seen in real-time data from unconventional sources, including Google mobility data, Open Table reservations, and social media metrics. More recently, the sharp rise in uncertainty&mdash;and some of the implications&mdash;can be seen in timely information from affected businesses. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia conducts a survey of manufacturing firms in its District. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure15-20250403.JPG" id="fig16">figure 15</a>, you can see that those firms report a significant rise so far this year in the prices they are paying for inputs and in the prices they expect to charge for their products. Turning to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure16-20250403.JPG" id="fig17">figure 16</a>, those firms report that current manufacturing activity was boosted in January&mdash;the spike in the orange line&mdash;in part as firms built up inventories ahead of expected trade policy changes. Activity then slowed, and their expectations of future activity have eased as well.</p>
<p>What about a second source of uncertainty&mdash;the structure of the economy? One aspect of that is how demand in the economy responds to changes in the Fed's policy rate. A way of judging those changes is by looking at financial conditions more broadly. Among the data series that matter for decisions of consumers and businesses are mortgage rates, other long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Using those variables, Fed staff have constructed an index of overall financial conditions, called FCI-G. You can see that in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-figure17-20250403.JPG" id="fig18">figure 17</a>. That index showed financial conditions easing notably (becoming a tailwind to GDP growth) in 2020 and into 2021 as the Fed eased policy in response to the economic fallout from the pandemic and then tightening sharply in 2022 along with higher Fed policy rates. Over the past two years, overall financial conditions have eased modestly amid a strong stock market and moderation in long-term interest rates as inflation came down. Currently, the FCI-G index shows financial conditions to be about neutral for GDP growth in the coming year.</p>
<p>What about uncertainty related to how private agents form expectations about future economic developments and policy actions as a source of uncertainty? Currently, I believe this is the primary source of uncertainty. Even before yesterday's larger than expected announcements on trade policy, businesses and consumers reported a high degree of uncertainty about current and future trade policy actions, and&mdash;as I discussed&mdash;surveys generally show increased expectations of inflation, at least for the coming year.</p>
<p>What could be the effects of that uncertainty, and what should be the monetary policy response? Tariff-related price increases and rising inflation expectations could argue for maintaining a restrictive stance for longer to reduce the risk of unanchored inflation expectations. But these price increases also lower disposable personal income, which could lead to lower consumer spending. And the uncertainty related to tariffs, by stalling hiring and investment, could generate a negative growth impulse to the economy and a weaker labor market.</p>
<p>Amid growing uncertainty and risks to both sides of our dual mandate, I believe it will be appropriate to maintain the policy rate at its current level while continuing to vigilantly monitor developments that could change the outlook.</p>
<p>Monetary policy is still moderately restrictive, though less so than before our rate cuts last year, which totaled 1 percentage point. Over time, if uncertainty clears and we see further progress on inflation toward our 2 percent target, it will likely be appropriate to lower the policy rate to reduce the degree of monetary policy restriction. I could imagine scenarios where rates could be held at current levels longer or eased faster based on the evolution of inflation and unemployment. For now, we can afford to be patient but attentive. I believe that policy is well situated to respond to developments, and I am continuously updating my outlook as matters evolve.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />As I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-end-slide-20250403.JPG" id="fig19">conclude</a>, I will reiterate the economy has been through an extraordinary period, since the onset of the pandemic, that has posed significant challenges for monetary policymakers. It is encouraging that inflation has moderated, albeit to a rate above our 2 percent target, while the labor market and broader economy remain solid. It appears that the economy, for the moment, has entered a period of uncertainty. I will repeat that I believe that current monetary policy is well positioned to respond to coming economic developments, and I will be watching those developments carefully.</p>
