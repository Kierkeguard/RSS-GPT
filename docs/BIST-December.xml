<ul>
<li>New Electronic Deferred Payment (EDP) solutions to be launched in mid-2025 to support transition to e-payments</li>
<li>Deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques extended by one year to end-2026</li>
<li>Retail cheques, cashier&rsquo;s orders and USD cheques continue to be available</li>
</ul>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) today announced that two new payments solutions will be launched in mid-2025 to support the transition to e-payments for both corporate and retail cheque users<sup>1</sup>. These solutions will complement Singapore's existing suite of e-payment modes, including PayNow, FAST, GIRO and MEPS+. To allow corporates sufficient time to adopt these new solutions, MAS and ABS have also announced a one-year extension of the deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques.<br /><br /><span>New solutions to support cheque users in transitioning to e-payments<br /></span><br />2&nbsp;<span> </span>To provide greater convenience to corporates and individuals, ABS, in partnership with the Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)<sup>2</sup>, will be launching the new EDP and EDP+ solutions<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;in mid-2025 to address the use cases of post-dated payments and transactions requiring greater certainty of payment respectively. Both EDP and EDP+ will be accessible via digital banking platforms, and will leverage PayNow to allow payers to identify payees conveniently when making payments via either solution. MAS encourages all cheque users to adopt these e-payment alternatives once they are made available.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Extended timeline for processing SGD corporate cheques<br /></span><br />3&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS and banks will extend the deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques by an additional year.<br /><br />4&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS had previously&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-announces-end-2025-timeline-to-eliminate-corporate-cheques"><span class="mas-link__text">announced&nbsp;</span></a>that corporate cheques would be eliminated and that all banks in Singapore would stop issuing new corporate cheque books in 2025. MAS and the banks have assessed that more time should be given to corporates to familiarise themselves with new and existing e-payment modes, as well as for corporates to shift from cheques to EDP and EDP+. In view of this, while banks will stop issuing new cheque books to corporates by 31 December 2025, the deadline to cease processing of corporate cheques will be extended to 31 December 2026.<br /><br />5&nbsp;<span> </span>Corporate cheque payees should present their cheques for clearing well before 31 December 2026, to ensure that their cheques can be processed before the deadline.<br /><br /><span>Public consultation on roadmap to sunset corporate cheques and transition plan for retail cheques<br /></span><br />6&nbsp;<span> </span>Retail cheques will continue to be available, along with cashier&rsquo;s orders and USD cheques for both corporate and retail customers.<br /><br />7&nbsp;<span> </span>Major retail banks in Singapore will continue to waive cheque service fees for seniors<sup>4</sup>.<br /><br />8&nbsp;<span> </span>Details on the transition plan from cheques to e-payments, as well as proposed initiatives that focus on addressing the needs and concerns of corporates and individuals, can be found in the&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/consultations/2024/consultation-paper-on-roadmap-to-sunset-corporate-cheques-and-transition-plan-for-retail-cheques"><span class="mas-link__text">public consultation paper</span></a>&nbsp;released today by MAS. MAS invites interested parties to submit their feedback by 17 January 2025.</p>
<p>***</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;">Corporate cheques refer to cheques issued by body corporates, entities or businesses. Retail cheques refer to cheques issued by individuals.</span></li>
<li>hese banks are Citibank, DBS Bank, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC Singapore, Standard Chartered Bank and UOB.</li>
<li>The main difference between EDP and EDP+ lies in when funds are deducted from the payer&rsquo;s account. For EDP, funds are deducted upon presentment by the payee, while for EDP+, funds are deducted immediately upon issuance. For more details on EDP and EDP+, please refer to the&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/publications/consultations/2024/consultation-paper-on-roadmap-to-sunset-corporate-cheques-and-transition-plan-for-retail-cheques" style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;"><span class="mas-link__text">consultation paper</span></a><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;">.</span></li>
<li>Seniors who are at age 60 (or above) as of 31 December 2025 will remain eligible for the waiver of cheque services fees after 31 December 2025.</li>

<title>CFTC Releases FY 2024 Enforcement Results - Obtains Record-Setting $17.1 Billion In Monetary Relief, Sanctions</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-releases-fy-2024-enforcement-results-obtains-record-setting-171-billion/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced record monetary relief of over $17.1 billion for fiscal year 2024. With the resolution of digital asset cases that resulted in the agency&rsquo;s largest recovery ever, this record amount included $2.6 billion in civil monetary penalties and $14.5 billion in disgorgement and restitution.</p>
<p>In FY 2024, the agency brought 58 new actions including precedent-setting digital asset commodities cases, its first actions addressing fraud in voluntary carbon credit markets, complex manipulation cases in various markets, and significant compliance cases &ndash; including its largest compliance case ever. The CFTC also continued to vigorously litigate pending actions, resulting in significant litigation victories and recoveries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CFTC remains steadfast in its duties to protect&nbsp;customers and vigorously oversee CFTC-regulated markets critical to the health of the U.S. economy,&rdquo; Chairman Rostin Behnam said. &ldquo;Misconduct in our jurisdictional markets is rarely confined, especially as these boundaries are continually being redefined by disruptive technology. I commend our Division of Enforcement for remaining thoughtful and agile in its response to evolving markets and a growing pool of participants. Their dedication to holding accountable those who violate the Commodity Exchange Act is invaluable to the American public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our actions in FY 2024 reflect our commitment to holding recidivist actors accountable, obtaining meaningful monetary relief and sanctions, and implementing robust remediation measures,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;This was a year of large-scale, complex cases and settlements in both our traditional markets and in areas of increasing importance, such as voluntary carbon markets. We are committed to prioritizing strong, effective, and focused enforcement to deter future misconduct. I thank our division staff for their unwavering dedication this year; with their expertise and professionalism they are staunch defenders of our markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enforcement Performance Highlights</p>
<p><i>Enforcement Advisory-October 2023</i></p>
<p>At the outset of FY 2024, the division issued an advisory &mdash; the Advisory Regarding Penalties, Monitors and Consultants, and Admissions in CFTC Enforcement Actions &mdash; providing enforcement staff guidance on enforcement resolution recommendations to the Commission.&nbsp;The advisory provides guidance on three areas: whether proposed civil monetary penalties are sufficient and at the level necessary to achieve general and specific deterrence, which determination includes consideration of respondent&rsquo;s recidivism; when the imposition of a corporate compliance monitor or consultant is appropriate and what the duties and responsibilities of monitors and consultants should be; and whether admissions should be recommended in a particular enforcement action. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8808-23">8808-23</a>]</p>
<p>The FY 2024 enforcement actions and litigation victories include the following:</p>
<p>Digital Asset Commodities</p>
<p>The CFTC continued to cement its reputation as a premier enforcement agency in the digital asset space. It secured record-breaking monetary sanctions and relief in FTX and Binance, charged Voyager&rsquo;s former CEO with commodity pool fraud, filed multiple actions involving decentralized finance, filed and settled charges with companies acting as intermediaries to digital asset exchanges, and brought a variety of other digital assets cases. For example, the Commission:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settled previously filed fraud claims against FTX and Alameda Research requiring them to pay $8.7 billion in restitution and $4 billion in disgorgement to further compensate victims for their losses. The $12.7 billion judgment is the largest recovery for victims and sanctions in CFTC history. The CFTC&rsquo;s litigation is continuing as to the other defendants in those cases, Samuel Bankman-Fried, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison, and, in a separate action, FTX co-owner Nishad Singh. [Press&nbsp;Releases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8638-22">8638-22</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8644-22">8644-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8669-23">8669-23</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8938-24">8938-24</a>]</li>
<li>Settled charges against Binance, Changpeng Zhao, its founder, and Samuel Lim, a former chief compliance officer, for operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and &ndash; in a first-of-its-kind settlement &ndash; with willfully evading or attempting to evade provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. The court imposed civil monetary penalties (CMP) against defendants: Zhao, $150 million; Lim, $1.5 million; and Binance, $1.35 billion and also ordered Binance to pay $1.35 billion in disgorgement.

<li>Charged Voyager&rsquo;s former CEO with commodity pool fraud and registration failures in connection with the bankruptcy of the Voyager digital asset platform and Voyager&rsquo;s operation of an unregistered commodity pool. This year, the federal district court denied the former CEO&rsquo;s motion to dismiss, holding in the CFTC&rsquo;s favor on numerous significant legal questions; the litigation is ongoing. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8805-23">8805-23</a>]</li>
<li>Won an order granting summary judgment on all counts finding defendants Seneca Ventures LLC, et al., fraudulently operated, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, an illegal commodity pool that purportedly invested in digital assets, derivatives and other instruments; defendants also misappropriated funds through a carbon offset program. Defendants were ordered to pay more than $110.9 million in a CMP, $83.7 million in restitution and $36.9 million in disgorgement.

</ul>
<p>Manipulative and Deceptive Conduct, Disruptive Trading and False Reporting</p>
<p>The CFTC is focused on detecting, investigating, and prosecuting misconduct &mdash; fraud, manipulation, disruptive trading, and false reporting &mdash; that can undermine market integrity. The CFTC filed actions relating to this type of misconduct across markets for gasoline, fuel oil, agricultural commodities, such as cotton and oats, and voluntary carbon credits. In FY 2024, related actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against CQC Impact Investors LLC, one of the largest voluntary carbon credit project developers in the world, and its former COO in connection with a fraudulent scheme reporting false and misleading data to at least one carbon credit registry, third-party reviewers, and others with the goal of obtaining carbon credits far beyond what CQC was entitled to receive and to increase the company&rsquo;s revenue by millions of dollars. The CFTC imposed a $1 million CMP. In October, the CFTC also filed a fraud complaint against CQC&rsquo;s former CEO. These marked the first-ever CFTC actions for fraud and false reports in the voluntary carbon credit market. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8994-24">8994-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against Trafigura Trading LLC for trading on misappropriated nonpublic information (physical and derivative gasoline transactions) and manipulation (fuel oil benchmark; Platts&rsquo; USGC HSFO Benchmark). The CFTC imposed a $55 million CMP. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8921-24">8921-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against energy trading company TotalEnergies Trading SA finding that, to benefit its derivatives positions, it manipulated the market for EBOB-linked futures contracts by affecting the benchmark price for physical EBOB, a type of refined automobile gasoline used primarily in Europe, that is published by the London-based price-reporting service Argus by selling physical EBOB at below market prices. The CFTC imposed a $48 million CMP. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8953-24">8953-24</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>Reporting, Risk Management, Adequate Compliance Programs and Business Practices</p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program helps to ensure registrants and registered entities comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements; adopt and implement proper risk management processes; maintain adequate compliance programs; and engage in appropriate business practices. In FY 2024, related actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, a registered swap dealer and FCM, for failing to diligently supervise its business as a CFTC registrant resulting in its failure to capture billions of orders in its surveillance systems.

Morgan&rsquo;s policies, procedures, and controls relating to trade surveillance. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8914-24">8914-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against registered swap dealer The Toronto Dominion Bank for the bank&rsquo;s lack of effective oversight and failure to supervise its electronic communications system, resulting in the failure to surveil certain communications for hundreds of its swap dealer personnel over a five-year period. The CFTC imposed a $4 million CMP. [Press Releases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8944-24">8944-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against CFTC registrants, including swap dealers and introducing brokers (IB), for recordkeeping and/or supervision violations, finding they failed to stop their employees, including senior-level staff, from using unapproved communication methods for a number of years. The CFTC imposed CMPs for recordkeeping and supervision violations on: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, $30 million; U.S. Bank N.A., $6 million; Cowen and Company, $3 million; The Toronto Dominion Bank, $75 million; Truist Bank, $3 million; Piper Sandler Hedging Services LLC, $2 million; and Oppenheimer &amp; Co.

</ul>
<p>Protecting Customers</p>
<p>Since its inception, the CFTC has focused on protecting customers in commodity and derivatives markets from fraud and other abuse. Many of the matters above involved important customer protection elements. In addition, below are other CFTC actions that protected the public, including significant litigation victories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charged Traders Domain FX Ltd., doing business as The Traders Domain, et al., alleging 16 defendants individually, and at times working together, made material fraudulent representations to their customers and misappropriated customer funds in a $283 million multi-layered Ponzi scheme to solicit funds for trading leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, specifically gold-to-U.S. dollar pairs as well as assorted other commodities, through pooled and individual accounts. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8997-24">8997-24</a>]</li>
<li>Charged defendants who claimed to operate an online platform that allowed customers to buy and sell cattle. The defendants allegedly solicited, accepted, and used customer funds to pay other customers in the nature of a Ponzi scheme. The defendants also allegedly received more than $161 million from over 2,000 victims in at least 14 states. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8911-24">8911-24</a>]</li>

[Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8950-24">8950-24</a>]</li>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against a registered FCM that failed to have adequate policies and procedures governing the emergency handling of accounts and did not exercise sufficient oversight over its employees&rsquo; handling of accounts in response to a statutory restraining order issued in a CFTC civil enforcement action charging fraud. These failures resulted in positions in the accounts remaining open for several days after the SRO was served, during which time the FCM lost more than $200,000. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8973-24">8973-24</a>]</li>

</ul>
<p>Misconduct Involving Confidential Information</p>
<p>Illegal use of confidential information can significantly undermine market integrity and harm customers in the CFTC&rsquo;s markets. As noted above in discussing anti-manipulation enforcement, the CFTC filed and settled an enforcement action against Trafigura Trading LLC finding it both misappropriated nonpublic information and manipulated a fuel oil benchmark. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8921-24">8921-24</a>] The CFTC filed the following additional actions related to misconduct involving confidential information:</p>

</ul>
<p>Trade Practice Violations</p>
<p>In addition to disruptive trading, which includes spoofing, the CFTC also investigates and prosecutes other trade practice violations that may adversely affect the integrity of the markets, such as violations involving wash trades, fictitious trades, and position limits. The CFTC achieved the following results in this program area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously filed and settled charges against Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc. for exceeding the federal and ICE Futures U.S. position limits in contracts that reference natural gas futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and for swap dealer supervision and position-limit monitoring failures.

</ul>
<p><i>Surveillance and Enforcement Data Analytics Office</i></p>
<p>Because of the increasingly important role of data analytics in the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program, this year the Division of Enforcement created a new Surveillance and Enforcement Data Analytics Office to enhance the division&rsquo;s surveillance and analytic capabilities. The office places the division&rsquo;s existing forensic economist and market surveillance capabilities into one office, an office that can scrutinize markets to detect misconduct, analyze complex matters, and support the division&rsquo;s investigations and litigations with sophisticated financial, economic, and data analysis. That structure also includes a new section that focuses on developing analytic tools and programs to enhance the investigative analytic, proactive detection, and surveillance capabilities of the division.</p>
<p><i>Cooperation with Criminal and Regulatory Authorities</i></p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program focuses on collaborative relationships with self-regulatory organizations, and state, federal, and international authorities, including achieving efficiencies through referrals, to meet its enforcement objectives. The parallel enforcement program showcases how the CFTC can most effectively protect markets when working together with colleagues in the enforcement and regulatory community.</p>
<p>Specifically, the CFTC believes a robust combination of criminal prosecution and regulatory enforcement is critical to deterring violators, punishing misconduct, preserving market integrity, and protecting market participants. An example is the settlement as to liability&nbsp;of a joint enforcement action filed by the CFTC and 30 state securities regulatory agencies that are members of the North American Securities Administrators Association charging a precious metals dealer and its owner for orchestrating a $68 million fraudulent nationwide scheme targeting elderly persons. [Press Release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8489-22">8489-22</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8812-23">8812-23</a>]</p>
<p><i>Whistleblower Program</i></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Program</a>&nbsp;continues to demonstrate its importance to the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program as reflected in the leads generated, successful enforcement actions, and whistleblower awards.&nbsp;The CFTC issued the most awards on record for any fiscal year, and, in another annual record, the Whistleblower Office received&nbsp;over 1,700 whistleblower tips.</p>
<p>Many different types of whistleblowers received awards this year, including victims, witnesses, insiders, market participants, employees, and compliance professionals.&nbsp;The CFTC granted 15 applications, totaling over $42 million in award payments. Enforcement actions associated with these awards resulted in monetary relief of approximately $162 million collected. Since making its first award in 2014, the CFTC has issued 53 orders granting nearly $390 million in award payments to whistleblowers. Enforcement actions associated with all program awards have resulted in monetary relief of over $3.2 billion.</p>
<p><em>An addendum to these results includes a table summary of the 58 new actions taken and a list of all FY 2024 actions including actions involving digital asset-related conduct.</em></p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Publish Summary Of 2024 Systemic Risk Survey Results</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/resources/csa-surveys/2024-csa-systemic-risk-survey-2/">a summary of the results</a>&nbsp;from its third annual systemic risk survey. The results of this survey provide the CSA with important information on market participants&rsquo; views about the stability of the Canadian financial system.<br /><br />The survey was completed by 536 Canadian portfolio managers and investment dealers between October 10 and November 4, 2024. Overall, respondents indicated that they were less concerned about Canadian financial stability than last year. In addition, concern about the level of interest rates fell sharply in this year&rsquo;s survey and was no longer the top concern for market participants. A likely key factor to this change was the recent and expected reductions in interest rates. Their main concerns at the time of the survey were household debt, cyber vulnerabilities, the geopolitical environment, and the housing market.<br /><br />&ldquo;It's encouraging to see the results from our third systemic risk survey, which indicates a positive view of financial stability in the Canadian capital markets,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We would also like to acknowledge the industry for their participation. With year-over-year growth in survey participation, we are able to gather critical information on changing risk perceptions in this new interest rate environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To read more about the survey and key findings, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/resources/csa-surveys/2024-csa-systemic-risk-survey-2/">CSA website</a>.</p>

<title>BC Securities Commission Debuts Updated Investment Caution List To Protect British Columbians</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-debuts-updated-investment-caution-list-to-protect-briti/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-debuts-updated-investment-caution-list-to-protect-briti/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The BC Securities Commission (BCSC) has launched an updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/enforcement/early-intervention/investment-caution-list">Investment Caution List</a>&nbsp;(ICL) as part of its intensified efforts to protect the public and combat the escalating threat of online investment fraud.</p>
<p>The list, which is constantly being updated, warns British Columbians about companies and individuals that may pose a risk to the public and that may be located in B.C. or accept B.C. residents as customers. Names are added to the list when they display one or more of the following characteristics:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not registered to provide investment services or investment opportunities&nbsp;</li>
<li>They are promoting investments that show signs of fraud&nbsp;</li>
<li>They impersonate legitimate, authorized firms, or use names similar to such firms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>As online investment fraud &ndash; often originating from outside Canada &ndash; has exploded in frequency, the BCSC expanded its criteria for including entities on the ICL. The list now includes any known aliases of entries and features clearer, plain-language explanations and information like the &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; of fraudulent investment schemes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one of the names on the list tries to sell you an investment or asks for money, immediately report it to the BCSC,&rdquo; said Doug Muir, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Enforcement. &ldquo;There is a risk of losing your entire investment, and the sooner we know about it, the better the chance that we can protect others from falling for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to taking complaints from the public, the BCSC provides investors with resources about how to protect themselves from investment fraud and help verify whether an individual or company is authorized to do business with B.C. residents.</p>
<p>The ICL is just one of the tools that the BCSC uses to disrupt online investment fraud. Other measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requesting the removal of suspicious websites and achieving 66 removals this year</li>
<li>Collaborating with other regulators and law enforcement agencies &ndash; in Canada and abroad &ndash; on joint efforts to protect investors and deter fraudsters from exploiting British Columbians</li>
<li>Working with the private sector on innovative ways to leverage their knowledge and expertise to reduce victimization</li>
<li>Communicating with registered crypto trading platforms and financial institutions on how to prevent harm to their clients</li>
<li>Alerting payment processors that they could be unknowingly handling proceeds of investment fraud</li>
<li>Issuing investor alerts about recently surfaced schemes that may pose a new, imminent risk to the public</li>
<li>Providing information through our investor education website, InvestRight.org, so people have the knowledge they need to identify and avoid online investment fraud, including specific scams involving artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, British Columbians reported losses of&nbsp;$46.4 million&nbsp;from online investment scams to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) &ndash; twice as much as the previous year. The real cost is likely much higher because the CAFC estimates that only five per cent of fraud victims report such incidents to authorities.</p>

<title>EBA Proposes Criteria To Appoint A Central Contact Point For Crypto-Asset Service Providers To Strengthen The Fight Against Money-Laundering And Terrorism Financing In Host Member States</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-proposes-criteria-to-appoint-a-central-contact-point-for-crypto-asset-servic/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-proposes-criteria-to-appoint-a-central-contact-point-for-crypto-asset-servic/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the criteria according to which crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) should appoint a central contact point to ensure compliance with local anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations of the host Member State. This consultation runs until 4 February 2025.</span></p>
<p>CASPs can provide services in other Member States through establishments other than branches. Once established, CASPs have to comply with local AML/CFT obligations, even if their establishments are not &lsquo;obliged entities&rsquo; themselves. This can make the AML/CFT supervision of services provided through these establishments difficult.</p>
<p>To address this, the draft RTS sets out the criteria for determining the circumstances in which the appointment of a central contact point is appropriate, as well as the functions of those central contact points. Since the same considerations apply to electronic money issuers (EMI) and payment service providers (PSPs) as they do to CASPs, the EBA proposes to retain the structure and approach set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1108 and extend existing provisions to CASPs (leaving the provisions that apply to EMIs and PSPs unchanged), while also introducing new provisions for CASPs where this is necessary in light of their business model and operation.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 4 February 2025.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on the consultation paper on 16 January 2024 from 15:00 to 17:00 Paris time. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-regulatory-technical-standards-amending-commission-delegated-regulation-eu">link</a>&nbsp;by 3 January 2023 at 16:00 CET. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, background</h4>
<p>Article 45(10) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 requires the EBA to develop RTS setting out the criteria for determining the circumstances in which the appointment of a central contact point is appropriate, and the functions of the central contact points.</p>
<p>A first version of such draft regulatory standards was issued in 2017. This Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1108 was published in the Official Journal of the EU in 2018. The scope was limited to EMIs and PSPs.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) 2023/1113 on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets applies from 30 December 2024. It amends Directive (EU) 2015/849, inter alia by extending its scope to crypto-asset service providers. Consequently, Article 45(9) of this Directive extends provisions that Member States may require EMIs and PSPs established on their territory in forms other than a branch, and whose head office is situated in another Member State, to appoint a CCP point in their territory to CASPs. This means that the EBA has to update the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1108.</p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Issue Statement On Elder Financial Exploitation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Five federal financial regulatory agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and state financial regulators issued a statement today to provide supervised institutions with examples of risk management and other practices that may be effective in combatting elder financial exploitation.</p>
<p>Older adults who experience financial exploitation can lose their life savings and financial security and face other harm. A FinCEN financial trend analysis of Bank Secrecy Act reports over a one-year period ending in June 2023 found that about $27 billion in reported suspicious activity was linked to elder financial exploitation.</p>
<p>Banks, credit unions, and other supervised institutions play an important role in combatting elder financial exploitation and supporting their customers who experience these crimes. The statement provides examples of risk management and other practices that supervised institutions may use to help identify, prevent, and respond to elder financial exploitation, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing effective governance and oversight, including policies and practices to protect account holders and the institution</li>
<li>Training employees on recognizing and responding to elder financial exploitation</li>
<li>Using transaction holds and disbursement delays, as appropriate, and consistent with applicable law</li>
<li>Establishing a trusted contact designation process for account holders</li>
<li>Filing suspicious activity reports to FinCEN in a timely manner</li>
<li>Reporting suspected elder financial exploitation to law enforcement, Adult Protective Services, and other appropriate entities</li>
<li>Providing financial records to appropriate authorities where consistent with applicable law</li>
<li>Engaging with elder fraud prevention and response networks</li>
<li>Increasing awareness through consumer outreach</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning five individuals and four entities that are associated with or leverage the TGR Group, a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention on behalf of Russian elites. This action also identifies a Wyoming-based entity that is owned 50 percent or more by a sanctioned individual. Today&rsquo;s action continues the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/11/joint-statement-by-the-g7-announcing-further-economic-costs-on-russia/">G7 commitment</a>&nbsp;to hold accountable parties that evade or offset the impact of international sanctions, including by using digital assets, and to impose costs on illicit actors that use digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth.&nbsp;<a class="external">These designations are the result of a collaborative effort with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s (UK) National Crime Agency, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets&mdash;in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins&mdash;to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,&rdquo; said Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, &ldquo;The United States, alongside our allies and partners, remains committed to disrupting any effort by Russia to use digital assets or other illicit financial schemes to accrue, store, and transfer their ill-gotten gains."</p>
<h3>the tgr group: enabler of sanctions evasion for Russian ELITES</h3>
<p>With touchpoints around the world, the TGR Group is an extensive sanctions evasion and money laundering network that works to obfuscate the illicit activities of its clients, including through the use digital assets, such as stablecoins like Tether (USDT). Controlled by Ukrainian national George Rossi, the networkprovides a range of services to place, layer, and integrate illicit financial schemes into the global financial system. These include: the laundering of funds associated with sanctioned entities; providing an unregistered service to exchange cash and cryptocurrency; the receipt of cash and making the value available to clients in the form of cryptocurrency; providing a pre-paid credit card service; and, obfuscating the source of funds to allow high-net worth Russian nationals to purchase property in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>To support their illicit&nbsp;activities, the TGR Group has leveraged other illicit actors, such as the Smart Group, led by Russian money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova (Zhdanova). On November&nbsp;3, 2023, OFAC&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1874">designated</a>&nbsp;Zhdanova,&nbsp;a Russian national, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy by laundering and moving funds using digital assets on behalf of Russian elites.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>key members of AN international money laundering network</h3>
<p><span>George Rossi</span>&nbsp;(Rossi), a Ukrainian national who was born in Russia, is believed to be in overall control of the TGR Group. Rossi is the founder of TGR Partners and is the non-executive director at TGR Corporate Concierge LTD, both entities that are also being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024. Rossi also controls a TGR Group-related company that leveraged OFAC-sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchange, Garantex OU, to process USDT transactions after its date of designation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Elena Chirkinyan</span>&nbsp;(Chirkinyan), a Russian national, is a direct subordinate to Rossi and is considered a decision maker within the TGR Group. Chirkinyan is also a partner at TGR Partners and the Chief Executive Officer of TGR Corporate Concierge LTD. Additionally, Chirkinyan is the manager of TGR DWC-LLC, an entity designated pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, Chirkinyan was involved in obfuscating the transfer of funds out of Russia, most likely to support the activities of a UK-sanctioned Russian-language media organization in the United Kingdom. These funds originated from RT (formerly known as Russia Today). On September 13, 2024, the Department of State&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/alerting-the-world-to-rts-global-covert-activities/">designated</a>&nbsp;Autonomous Non Profit Organization TV-Novosti, a federally funded Russian organization that controls the RT media channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, Chirkinyan coordinated with Zhdanova (via her moniker @monalisa7) to obfuscate the source of Russian client funds to purchase real estate property in the United Kingdom. Chirkinyan and other TGR Group members also arranged cash handovers in which USDT was sent to a cryptocurrency address controlled by Zhdanova, and in return cash was received by the TGR Group.</p>
<p><span>Andrejs Bradens</span>&nbsp;(Bradens), a Latvian national, is associated with multiple TGR Group companies, including Pullman Global Solutions LLC (Pullman Global) and TGR Corporate Concierge LTD. Pullman Global is a Wyoming-based entity that is owned by Bradens.</p>
<p><span>TGR Partners</span>&nbsp;is a Moscow, Russia-based entity that provides financial services such as asset management, cryptocurrency trading, foreign exchange market payments, and concierge services. TGR Partners maintains locations in Russia, the UK, and other parts of Europe and Asia. Rossi is the founder of TGR Partners and Chirkinyan is a partner at TGR Partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>TGR Corporate Concierge LTD&nbsp;</span>is a UK-based entity that is owned and directed by Bradens.&nbsp; Chirkinyan is the Chief Executive Officer of TGR Corporate Concierge LTD.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>TGR DWC-LLC</span>&nbsp;is a UAE-based entity that is managed by Chirkinyan. TGR DWC-LLC provided&nbsp;concierge services that may enable clients to obfuscate their sources of wealth and purchase high-value property.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Siam Expert Trading Company Limited</span>&nbsp;(Siam Expert) is a Thailand-based entity. Siam Expert has facilitated the export of electronic components to Russia. Siam Expert is also associated with Bradens.</p>
<p><span>Pullman Global Solutions LLC&nbsp;</span>(<span>Pullman Global</span>)<span>&nbsp;is a Wyoming-based entity that is owned by Bradens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>George Rossi, Elena Chirkinyan, Andrejs Bradens,&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;TGR Partners are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.</p>
<p>TGR Corporate Concierge LTD is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Bradens, an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TGR DWC-LLC is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Elena Chirkinyan, an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Siam Expert is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Pullman Global&nbsp;is being identified&nbsp;</span>for being owned in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by Andrejs Bradens, whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>affiliates of Sanctioned ekaterina zhadanova</h3>
<p><span>Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov&nbsp;</span>(Magomedov), a Russian national, and Zhdanova regularly coordinated to facilitate bulk cash and cryptocurrency money laundering transactions internationally. Magomedov and Zhdanova also coordinated a bulk cash hand-over in the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On multiple occasions, Magomedov brokered money laundering transactions for which Zhdanova fulfilled and received a commission fee. To facilitate their activities, the pair arranged for international bulk cash deliveries and the conversion of bulk currency into cryptocurrency for clients. Zhdanova and Magomedov likely used TGR Corporate Concierge LTD to facilitate invoice payments, monetary transfers and/or cash for USDT transactions. Certain transactions were also likely facilitated by TGR Partners, located in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><span>Nikita Vladimirovich Krasnov</span>, a Russian national, worked closely with Zhdanova as a key money laundering partner. As part of their scheme, Krasnov would arrange for intermediaries to deliver and convert bulk cash into cryptocurrency which would be deposited into cryptocurrency wallets in Zhdanova&rsquo;s name. Among other laundering methods, Krasnov and Zhdanova used a luxury watch company to facilitate trade-based money laundering. Krasnov is associated with the alias &ldquo;acescom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov and Nikita Vladimirovich Krasnov are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Ekaterina Zhdanova, an individual whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024.</p>
<h3>SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>As a result of today&rsquo;s action, all property and interests in property of the blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC&rsquo;s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons. U.S. persons must comply with OFAC regulations, including all U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens regardless of where they are located, all persons within the United States, and all U.S.- incorporated entities and their foreign branches. Non-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions. For example, non-U.S. persons are prohibited from causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to wittingly or unwittingly violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>U.S. persons may face civil or criminal penalties for violations of E.O. 14024.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-501/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%20501">OFAC&rsquo;s&nbsp;Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines&nbsp;</a>provide more information regarding OFAC&rsquo;s enforcement of U.S. sanctions, including the factors that OFAC generally considers when determining an appropriate response to an apparent violation.</p>
<p>In addition, financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC&rsquo;s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897">OFAC&rsquo;s Frequently Asked Question 897 here</a>. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for&nbsp;<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list">removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here</a>.</p>

<p>The global economy is projected to remain resilient despite significant challenges, according to the OECD&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-economic-outlook-volume-2024-issue-2_d8814e8b-en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Economic Outlook"><span><i>Economic Outlook</i></span></a>. The Outlook projects global GDP growth of 3.3% in 2025, up from 3.2% in 2024, and 3.3% in 2026.</p>
<p>Inflation in the OECD is expected to ease further, from 5.4% in 2024 to 3.8% in 2025 and 3.0% in 2026, supported by the still restrictive stance of monetary policy in most countries. Headline inflation has already returned to central bank targets in nearly half of the advanced economies and close to 60% of emerging market economies.</p>

<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;We delivered total ADV of $45 billion in November, an increase of 56% from the prior year, driven by a rebound in U.S. Treasury ADV. In credit, record emerging markets ADV, which increased 15%, and record municipal bond ADV helped offset lower U.S. high-yield activity driven by lower credit spread volatility. We recently launched our block trading solution, and we are experiencing positive client engagement in the emerging markets hard currency market. 21 dealers and 26 long-only clients were active with the average trade size executed over $4 million notional. We have also enhanced our portfolio trading functionality to include benchmark trading and a record 76% of portfolio trading volume was executed on X-Pro. We believe both of these initiatives are critical to growing our market share in U.S. credit in the coming quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>General Notes Regarding the Data Presented</b></p>
<p>Reported MarketAxess volume in all product categories includes only fully electronic trading volume. MarketAxess trading volumes and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (&ldquo;TRACE&rdquo;) reported volumes are available on the Company&rsquo;s website at&nbsp;<a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;esheet=54161563&amp;newsitemid=20241203025005&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=investor.marketaxess.com%2Fvolume&amp;index=1&amp;md5=16c19fccae684034553a2c961f3ef7e7" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">investor.marketaxess.com/volume</a>.</p>
<p>For periods beginning with January 2024, the Company has made changes to the market volume data used to calculate estimated market share for Municipal and U.S. Government Bonds. For Municipal Bonds, the Company previously used estimates, derived from data issued by the Municipal Securities Rule Making Board (&ldquo;MSRB&rdquo;), including estimates for new issuance, commercial paper and variable-rate trading activity, and excluded these volumes from the estimated market volume data. While the Company still uses estimates, the new methodology for identifying and excluding these volumes from the market volume data is now based on MSRB &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to identify new issuance, commercial paper, and variable-rate volumes. For U.S. Government Bonds, the previous data source for estimated market volumes was the Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Reported Primary Dealer U.S. Treasury Bond Trading Volumes, which was reported on a one-week lag. The new source for U.S. Government Bond trading volumes is FINRA&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury TRACE data. The Company believes that the refined methodology used for Municipal Bonds, and the new data source for U.S. Government Bonds, provides more accurate measures of estimated market volumes and estimated market share.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b><span>KEY POINTS</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SET launches standardized CISA testing centers in partnership with alliance universities in Thailand&rsquo;s northern, northeastern and southern regions.</b></li>
<li><b>The initiative jumpstarts investment analysis careers for university students and aspiring talents amid growing regional investor base.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien highlighted that regional economic growth has spurred investor base expansion in provincial areas, driving demand for financial and investment analysis professionals. Responding to this growth, SET has formed strategic partnerships with Khon Kaen University, Chiang Mai University, and Prince of Songkla University to establish regional testing centers for the Certified Investment and Securities Analyst (CISA) program. This pioneering initiative aims to broaden career pathway for university students and aspiring analysts across the regions by making certification examination more accessible and traveling cost reduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SET and its partners have built a legacy of capital market talent development since 2005, producing more than 2,600 CISA professionals who are instrumental in meeting the sophisticated demands of an expanding investor base through segment-tailored investment solutions offered by the stock exchange. In this dynamic environment, talented professionals stand as the driving force behind the sustainable growth of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market and economy,&rdquo; said Soraphol.</p>
<p>The CISA program sets the professional standard for capital market professional careers through its two-tier structure of Foundation Knowledge level (AISA certificate) and Advanced Knowledge level (CISA certificate) &mdash; credentials that constitute SEC-recognized qualifications for investment analyst and fund manager license applications. CISA examinations are conducted at designated testing centers, all operating under standardized protocols established by SET.

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding Flexion Mobile Plc</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-flexion-mobile/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-nasdaq-stockholm-disciplinary-committee-regarding-flexion-mobile/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Flexion Mobile Plc (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of seven annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 2,143,071.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee notes that it is undisputed that the Company has violated the Rulebook on three occasions, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Company did not disclose its annual financial report for 2022 on time.</li>
<li>The Company did not disclose its annual financial report for 2023 on time.</li>
<li>The Company did not properly disclose insider information when its update for the fourth quarter of 2023 and results video presentation were published prematurely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee considers the violations to be serious and of a nature that would normally lead to delisting. The Disciplinary Committee notes that it is undisputed that the violations were at least partly due to reasons beyond the Company's control. According to the Committee, the circumstances are not such that they absolve the Company from responsibility, but they justify that the penalty is instead determined to be a fine. In view of the fact that the Company, despite warnings from the Exchange, has committed repeated violations of the Regulations, two of which are of a similar nature, and the significant delay regarding the publication of the Company's annual financial report for 2022, the Disciplinary Committee sets the fine at seven annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>FSB Plenary Meets In Hong Kong</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-plenary-meets-in-hong-kong/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-plenary-meets-in-hong-kong/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary met yesterday and today in Hong Kong. Members discussed the outlook for global financial stability, including issues of particular relevance to emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). The Plenary also reviewed policy work in several areas, including climate-related financial risks, crypto-assets and global stablecoins, cross-border payments, and non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI).</p>
<p>Members also agreed on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025, confirmed the extension of Klaas Knot&rsquo;s term as FSB Chair until 1 July 2025, and discussed the process for selection of a new FSB Chair.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Financial stability outlook</span></h4>
<p>Long-standing vulnerabilities in the financial system remain. The global economy and financial system continue to be affected by economic and financial conditions, policy uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions. Globally, asset valuations remain elevated, while the heightened market volatility in early August suggests they are susceptible to further shocks.</p>
<p>Members discussed a number of issues, including the combination of high private and public debt and large bank holdings of domestic government bonds in some jurisdictions, which may lead to greater transmission of shocks between sovereigns and banks. Changing investor expectations about interest rates or geopolitical tensions could also spark market and capital flow volatility. Members also discussed recent developments in crypto-asset markets and global stablecoins, and the FSB&rsquo;s work in this area.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Climate-related financial risks</span></h4>
<p>The FSB supports international coordination of work to address financial risks from climate change through its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2021/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-climate-related-financial-risks/">Roadmap for Addressing Climate-related Financial Risks</a>. The Plenary discussed progress in the four areas of the Roadmap as well as EMDE-specific climate vulnerabilities and ways to help address those vulnerabilities. Members stressed the importance of continued external engagement and coordination with international bodies on climate-related financial risks. The FSB will issue its next report on progress with the Roadmap in mid-2025.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Cross-border payments</span></h4>
<p>In October 2022, the FSB published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priorities-for-the-next-phase-of-work/">prioritisation plan</a>&nbsp;and engagement model for taking the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments forward.&nbsp;It followed up, in 2023, by setting out priority actions for achieving the G20 goals for cheaper, faster, more transparent, and more accessible cross-border payments. While more than half of the priority actions have been completed, the FSB&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/10/annual-progress-report-on-meeting-the-targets-for-cross-border-payments-2024-report-on-key-performance-indicators/">Key Performance Indicators report</a>&nbsp;suggests that the work done so far is not yet sufficient and that further efforts are needed to improve the user experience across all payments market segments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Plenary discussed ongoing legal, regulatory, and supervisory challenges and measures to address them, including the finalisation of the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations to promote greater alignment and interoperability in data frameworks that apply to cross-border payments, and recommendations to strengthen the consistency in the regulation and supervision of banks and non-banks in their provision of cross-border payments services. The group discussed measures to promote their implementation, within and beyond the G20.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</span></h4>
<p>The FSB is continuing its substantial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/enhancing-the-resilience-of-non-bank-financial-intermediation-progress-report-4/">work programme to enhance the resilience of NBFI</a>. As part of this, the FSB will shortly publish its final policy recommendations on measures to enhance liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls and will be launching a consultation on proposed policy recommendations to monitor and address financial stability risks from NBFI leverage. Data issues are hampering efforts to further improve the ability of authorities to effectively assess vulnerabilities stemming from the non-bank sector and to calibrate appropriate policies. The Plenary agreed to steps for how to overcome these challenges.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>Implementation of resolution reforms</span></h4>
<p>Members discussed progress in addressing the lessons learnt for resolution from the 2023 banking turmoil and key resolution work priorities for 2025. The Plenary agreed on the list of insurers subject to the resolution planning standards of the FSB&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/market-and-institutional-resilience/post-2008-financial-crisis-reforms/effective-resolution-regimes-and-policies/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions/">Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a>.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>FSB work programme</span></h4>
<p>The Plenary discussed the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2025, including deliverables to South Africa&rsquo;s G20 Presidency.

<title>ASIC Signals Ongoing Work To Maximise Benefits Of The Reportable Situations Regime</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-signals-ongoing-work-to-maximise-benefits-of-the-reportable-situations-regi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-signals-ongoing-work-to-maximise-benefits-of-the-reportable-situations-regi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The reportable situations regime is a key component of the financial services and credit regulatory frameworks. ASIC expects all licensees, regardless of size, to have robust systems and processes in place to ensure timely detection and reporting of non-compliance.</p>
<p>These expectations were highlighted in recent legal proceedings filed by ASIC against United Super Pty Ltd (United Super), the trustee of Cbus, for systemic claims handling failures and for failing to lodge a reportable situation within the required 30 days (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-251mr-asic-sues-cbus-alleging-systemic-claims-handling-failures/" title="24-251MR ASIC sues Cbus alleging systemic claims handling failures">24-251MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said compliance with the reportable situations regime, which requires licensees to promptly identify, fix and report their own problems, can help lift industry standards and in turn improve consumer outcomes.&nbsp;At the same time, the reports submitted help ASIC to detect emerging issues and non-compliant behaviour early and take action where appropriate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have undertaken extensive work to strengthen the operation of the reportable situations regime since the introduction of the October 2021 reforms, and ensuring that the objectives of the regime are met remains a priority area of work for us in 2024-25,&rsquo; Commissioner O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As part of this, we will consult with stakeholders on options for future granular reporting to provide even deeper insights, ahead of our fourth annual publication of reportable situations data in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition, we will do further work next year to consider how best to ensure ASIC receives the reports that have the most intelligence value to us, while managing the burden on industry from reporting. We will also undertake a range of work on a sector-by-sector basis to monitor and uplift compliance with the regime, and consider enforcement action where necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to further uplift compliance with the regime, ASIC has today published insights, key questions and a set of best practice examples for licensees to reflect on and inform changes to better meet their obligations under the regime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These insights are informed by a recent review of licensees who had not lodged a reportable situation, or who had lodged very few,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>The review found areas for improvement in how licensees identified incidents and breaches, and in their broader incident management and compliance and oversight arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have set out a range of prompts alongside our findings to help not just the review sample, but all licensees to strengthen their practices in critical areas,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We call on licensees to assess their own arrangements against the findings and prioritise where improvements may be required.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC is obliged to report annually on information that is provided under the reportable situations regime, which it did on 31 October 2024, for the third year.</p>
<p>The reports published since the commencement of the regime have not named licensees nor refer to the nature or number of reports lodged by specific licensees. ASIC will be consulting with stakeholders in 2025 about potential changes to this approach for future publications.</p>
<p>Since reforms to the reportable situations regime were introduced in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC updated Regulatory Guide 78&nbsp;<em>Breach reporting by AFS licensees and credit licensees</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-78-breach-reporting-by-afs-licensees-and-credit-licensees/" title="RG 78 Breach reporting by AFS licensees and credit licensees">RG 78</a>) in April 2023 to improve the operation of the regime, including for example, clarifying when licensees can group reports.</li>
<li>ASIC announced relief in October 2023 (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-extends-reportable-situations-relief-and-personal-advice-record-keeping-requirements/" title="ASIC extends reportable situations relief and personal advice record keeping requirements">extended in September 2024</a>) to manage the reporting burden on licensees. Together with updated guidance, the relief contributed to a 27% reduction in year-on-year reporting volumes.</li>
<li>ASIC introduced a machine-to-machine interface for high-volume reporters to lodge their reports more efficiently with ASIC.</li>

<title>ASIC Invites Feedback On Proposed Updates To Digital Asset Guidance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-invites-feedback-on-proposed-updates-to-digital-asset-guidance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC today released Consultation paper 381&nbsp;<em>Updates to INFO 225: Digital Assets: Financial Products and Services</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-381-updates-to-info-225-digital-assets-financial-products-and-services/" title="CP 381 Updates to INFO 225: Digital assets: Financial products and services">CP 381</a>) outlining proposals to update Information Sheet 225<em>&nbsp;Crypto Assets&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/" title="Crypto-assets">INFO 225</a>).</p>
<p>To provide greater clarity about the current law, ASIC has proposed a range of updates to INFO 225, including adding 13 practical examples of how the current financial product definitions apply to digital assets and related products.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, &lsquo;We want to promote the growth of responsible financial innovation while ensuring consumer protection. A well-regulated financial system benefits everyone in the community as it supports consumer confidence, market integrity and facilitates competition and innovation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s financial services regulatory regime is broad and technology neutral. Many digital assets and related products are financial products under the current law. Stakeholders have been calling for greater clarity and in response, we are releasing our draft updated guidance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We encourage all stakeholders to engage with the consultation process. We recognise that industry will need some time to consider and act on our updated guidance, so we are also consulting on a proposed transitional approach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Generally, ASIC&rsquo;s existing approach to financial services licences will apply to digital assets. For example, whether an applicant is proposing to deal in traditional securities or securities based on a digital asset platform, the same licensing regime applies.</p>
<p>CP 381 seeks feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s updated guidance in INFO 225, including the worked examples,</li>
<li>the application of the existing Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence processes, ASIC guidance and standard conditions to digital asset businesses,</li>
<li>practical licensing issues for wrapped tokens and &lsquo;stablecoins&rsquo;, issues arising from the potential transition to the Government&rsquo;s proposed digital asset platform and payment stablecoins regimes, and consideration of potential regulatory relief, and</li>
<li>a potential class &lsquo;no action&rsquo; position for digital asset businesses that are in the process of applying for or varying an AFS licence, Australian Markets Licence or Clearing and Settlement Facility licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC seeks the feedback on the proposed updated INFO 225 and the issues raised in CP 381 by 5pm on 28 February 2025. Details on responding can be found in the consultation paper.</p>
<p>ASIC intends to publish a final version of the updated INFO 225 in mid-2025, after considering feedback received through the consultation process.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to use its full range of regulatory and enforcement tools, such as guidance, licensing, compliance and enforcement action, to protect consumers and uphold market integrity in the digital asset sector.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CP 381 consultation package is aimed at all firms involved in digital assets, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>existing financial services and financial markets businesses, including those exploring the application of blockchain technology to existing financial products and real-world assets (e.g. tokenisation),</li>
<li>new digital asset businesses,</li>
<li>brokers and intermediaries,</li>
<li>professional advisers to the above businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC first published INFO 225 in September 2017, with updates made in 2018, 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s position continues to be that many digital assets are financial products under the current law.</p>
<p>CP 381 is aligned to and supportive of the Government&rsquo;s broader work in relation to the proposed payment services reform and digital asset facility reforms.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Encouraged By First Climate Statements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-encouraged-by-first-climate-statements/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-encouraged-by-first-climate-statements/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has today published its Climate-Related Disclosures insights report from the first set of entities that were required to file climate statements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA reviewed 70 climate statements that were prepared by climate reporting entities (CREs) for reporting periods ended between December 2023 and March 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA&rsquo;s review looked at compliance with the disclosure requirements in the External Reporting Board&rsquo;s Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards and the legislative requirements under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The purpose of the report is to provide timely and useful feedback for climate reporting entities to improve disclosure in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Audit, Financial Reporting and Climate Related Disclosures, Jacco Moison said: &ldquo;We are pleased with the efforts that CREs have made to prepare and lodge their first set of mandatory climate statements under the CRD regime. Climate reporting entities have put in an enormous effort to ensure their first mandatory climate statements were prepared on time. We acknowledge that some have faced challenges, including obtaining reliable data, incurring higher-than expected costs and deciding how to make disclosures in the absence of guidance on certain topics.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a sample of the key insights from the report. See the full report for more details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information disclosed&nbsp;</p>
<p>CREs need to strike the right balance on the amount of information disclosed. Disclosing too much may risk obscuring material information for primary users, while disclosing too little may result in material information being omitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA found instances where climate statements included substantial detail about certain processes or included information that may not have been relevant or specific to the CRE itself. It also observed climate statements that may have omitted disclosures required by Climate Standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has recommended CREs carefully consider both their own facts and circumstances, as well as the nature and characteristics of their primary users, to ensure they only disclose material information in relation to each disclosure required by the Climate Standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fairly present disclosures&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Climate Standards require that climate statements are presented fairly. The FMA found that some entities presented information that may have over emphasised positive news or impacts at the expense of a balanced representation. Some disclosed information that was difficult to understand or incomplete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explain the how&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclosures across the governance, risk management and strategy thematic areas require CREs to explain how processes are undertaken. Others require disclosure of how these processes or matters are embedded across an organization. In some instances, the FMA observed entities simply disclosing that a process takes place or that it is connected to other part of their business without providing any explanation about what is involved in that process or the nature and extent of the connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA intends to continue its educative and constructive approach to the monitoring of climate statements. Two webinars will be held with the sector this month as well as further engagements in the new year to discuss the report&rsquo;s findings. &nbsp;</p>

<title>US Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Seek Further Comment On Interagency Effort To Reduce Regulatory Burden</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their third notice requesting comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and federal bank regulatory agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated or otherwise unnecessary regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.</p>
<p>To facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for three categories: Rules of Procedure, Safety and Soundness, and Securities. The public has 90 days from publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register&nbsp;</em>to comment on the relevant regulations.</p>
<p>The agencies will request comment on regulations in the remaining categories in 2025, asking the public to identify the regulations they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.</p>
<p>The agencies will hold a series of outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The reporting framework for investment firms is amended to comply with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) and to align with the changes included in the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting for credit institutions.</em></li>
<li><em>The amendments cover supervisory reporting requirements on counterparty credit risk, market risk (K-NPR) and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today amendments to its final draft ITS on the supervisory reporting and disclosures of investment firms.</span></p>
<p>The ITS on investment firms reporting and disclosures foresee that investment firms could opt to report the same information &ndash; as set out in the COREP templates &ndash; as credit institutions. Formally, the alignment with the reporting by credit institutions was achieved by adding cross-references to the applicable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/supervisory-reporting/implementing-technical-standards-supervisory-reporting-changes-related-crr3crd6-step-1">ITS on Supervisory reporting by credit institutions</a>. Following the amendments introduced in the CRR3, it was necessary to update the references included in the ITS for reporting of investment firms.</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>In December 2024, the EBA will publish a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-40">technical package</a>, which includes the data point modelling (DPM), validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by investment firms to submit this supervisory reporting information to supervisors.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has developed these draft ITS according to Article 54(3) and Article 49(2) of&nbsp; the IFR - (EU) 2019/2033 - &nbsp;which mandate the EBA to develop a reporting framework and a disclosure requirements for investment firms.</p>
<p>The Investment Firms Prudential Package consists of the Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and the Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, which were published in the Official Journal on 5 December 2019 and establish a new prudential framework for investment firms authorised under MIFID.</p>

<title>A Year In Review: A Tale of Two Supply Shocks, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At The Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, Michigan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Jason, and thank you for the opportunity to speak here in Detroit today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;This visit has allowed me to see the many encouraging signs in this region: growth here in downtown; the area's famously hard-working labor force; and the gritty Detroit Lions, with 11 wins this season and counting. The nation has taken notice. But, truly, one of my favorite parts of serving as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board is visiting communities across the country and hearing directly from the families, workers, and businesses we serve.</p>
<p>I am also glad to have the chance to speak with you near the end of the year. I think it is an appropriate time to look back and assess how the U.S. economy has developed over the course of 2024. I will also share with you my outlook and offer my views on U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>I will start by saying that I view the economy as being in a good position after making significant progress in recent years toward our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains solid, and inflation appears to be on a sustainable path to our 2 percent goal, even if there have been some bumps along the way, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>Reaching this point for the economy was far from assured, especially if you reflect on the pandemic disruptions of nearly five years ago. Even the more recent performance of the economy, at least on the surface, has been surprising to many forecasters. Economic growth remained solid, while inflation moderated from its recent peak without the painful job losses that have often accompanied past efforts to counter high inflation.</p>
<p>Heading into this year, that was not necessarily the forecast of many observers, who were expecting a notable deceleration of economic activity. For example, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators in December 2023 expected 1.3 percent GDP growth for all of 2024. More recent estimates show the economy is on track to grow at almost twice that rate this year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>So how does one interpret these positive, if somewhat unexpected, results? For me, I turned to looking at not just the realities around me and listening to people around the country, but also to my background as an academic researcher who uses an evidence-based approach to recognize two very important developments that have shaped the economy this year: growth in the labor force stemming from an increase in immigration, and a surge in productivity. I have been closely monitoring these developments and discussing them for more than a year.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing the Economy Entering 2024</strong><br />Entering this year, I took notice of several peculiar puzzles that seemed to be playing out in the economy. In terms of overall growth, I noticed a significant divergence between two important measures of output: gross domestic product, or GDP, and gross domestic income, or GDI. While, over time, these two gauges should move together, they appeared to be out of sync heading into this year. The GDI data suggested rather anemic growth, averaging about 1 percent a quarter in 2023, contrary to very strong GDP readings of more than 2.5 percent. The two measures of output had contrasting implications for productivity growth.</p>
<p>There was a second puzzle in the labor market. Many forecasters expected that the labor market would remain somewhat tight this year, as rebalancing in the labor market had already attracted a large fraction of the available working-age population: The labor force participation of prime-age workers had reached levels not seen since the late 1990s. However, upon closer examination, I saw a more mixed picture.</p>
<p>On the one hand, payroll gains, while slowing, were still averaging a very robust pace of more than 200,000 jobs per month. Data from that time suggest that workers were easily able to find jobs, and measures of layoffs were low by historical standards. In fact, in certain industries, such as health care as well as leisure and hospitality, employment had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That raised questions about whether the supply of workers for those fields could keep pace with demand.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the unemployment rate was flat instead of declining. This was puzzling considering a robust pace of payroll gains and the assumption that labor supply was constrained. And the two most important labor market surveys sent somewhat divergent signals. The payroll survey of employers showed hiring was abnormally above the gain recorded by the survey of households. Was the economy expanding at a robust pace, as indicated by the payroll survey? Or was it slowing more, as suggested by the household survey?</p>
<p>In considering these questions, I interpreted the strong pace of payrolls from the establishment survey and the cooling of various measures of resource utilization as a signal that perhaps the official population estimates were understated to the downside. Starting at the end of 2023, I asked, what if substantial increases in the labor force due to the arrival of workers from other countries had not yet been picked up in Census estimates?</p>
<p>We had seen something similar before. In the late 1990s, official measures of the population were substantially revised up due to mismeasured immigration. During this period, establishment and household counts of workers also significantly diverged.</p>
<p>And a third puzzle, with inflation, also warrants attention. Inflation had steadily progressed toward the FOMC's target during 2023, perhaps faster than some economists expected. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index eased from a peak of 7.2 percent in June 2022 to about 3 percent at the end of 2023, measured on a 12-month basis. When excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation similarly eased from a peak of 5.6 percent in February 2022 to 3 percent at the end of last year. Wage growth measures were consistent with inflation declining.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Developments This Year</strong><br />At the turn of the new year, new data and other economic developments appeared to cloud the picture further. An uptick in consumer spending and overall economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as a stretch of above-trend hiring gave a signal of unexpected strength to start the year. Adding to the puzzling figures, core inflation rose 0.5 percent in January, a notable acceleration from an average monthly increase of 0.15 percent in the previous quarter. Stronger-than-expected economic activity, faster hiring, and a reacceleration of prices gave some economists pause: Was this a temporary acceleration, or a more sustained reheating of the economy? I viewed it as likely temporary, as it turned out to be.</p>
<p>My view has always been that progress in the fight against inflation has to be judged from trends, not from a data release or two. I also anticipated that the process of bringing down inflation was likely to be sometimes bumpy. However, I viewed the elevated inflation readings as partly stemming from seasonal and one-off factors not fully accounted for in the data. In addition, price changes in some categories are difficult to measure, as I have described in previous speeches.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;That is particularly true for certain services categories for which direct sources of prices are not available; for example, the cost of living in an owner-occupied home or costs associated with certain financial transactions. And, as I have also discussed, the slow adjustment in workers' wages and relative prices may have contributed to bumps on the road to disinflation. Indeed, by the second quarter of the year, it became clear that the earlier firmer inflation figures were indeed temporary. Inflation stepped back down to average monthly increases of less than 0.2 percent. A factor in that was a cooling labor market, which I will discuss in a moment. With the labor market less tight, wage growth leveled off, and that in turn allowed prices for labor-intensive services to moderate.</p>
<p>There was another important development early this year: Estimates of population growth were revised substantially higher, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The report showed about 6 million additional immigrants than were included in official estimates. Those workers added to the supply of labor, which had rebounded early in the pandemic recovery at a time when the unemployment rate was trending near half-century lows.</p>
<p>That information was consistent with my hypothesis that the strength in the economy was in part due to a larger-than-estimated labor force, or what economists call a positive supply shock. You may be more familiar with negative shocks, like the pandemic causing constrained supply chains. But the increase of workers was a positive shock and is notable because the underlying demographics of the U.S. heading into the pandemic were consistent with a slow-growing population and lower labor force participation, and that dynamic got worse as the pandemic generated excess retirements and a fall in immigration.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor market, I anticipated that after several months of strong job growth at the turn of the year, the labor market would cool significantly. And, indeed, by the middle of this year, the process of the labor market normalizing was taking shape. Payroll gains declined from an average pace of 260,000 in the first quarter to less than 200,000 in the second. Reports on the labor market included unusually large downward revisions to previous gains, and the unemployment rate moved higher, from 3.7 percent in January to 4.1 percent in June. At this point, other economists quickly shifted from worrying about a labor market that might be too hot early in the year to one that might be cooling too quickly. As a Fed policymaker, I had to consider if this movement was consistent with our mandate for maximum employment.</p>
<p>Even with the easing in the labor market, consumer spending and overall economic activity continued to show solid growth. The combination of strong spending data and a cooling labor market was confounding. In thinking about this, I examined the productivity data that I follow closely and did not see the type of productivity growth I would have expected based on several other observations of the economy.</p>
<p>For example, new business formation had surged in the post-pandemic period. It has been shown that newer firms foster innovation and boost productivity growth. Business formation has remained elevated, from which I infer that the boost to productivity growth is not just a one-time phenomenon. Also, in the post-pandemic period, workers switched jobs at much higher rates than typical. This likely led to better matches where workers can find more productive uses of their skills. In some cases, immigrants filled job openings for which employers traditionally struggle to attract workers. Therefore, immigration can also contribute to improvements in job matches in specific but key sectors. As the economy reopened from the pandemic, many firms also invested in technology to substitute for workers, who were in short supply, which should support productivity gains. Emerging technologies, most notably artificial intelligence, may also be starting to contribute to enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Therefore, my speculation was that higher productivity was a possible explanation for the unusual combination of strong economic output, a cooling labor market, and declining inflation&mdash;even if it was not apparent in the quarterly data.</p>
<p>That hunch was confirmed in September, when annual revisions to important economic data showed that economic activity and productivity growth had been stronger than previously estimated. The new figures indicated an average annual rate of productivity growth of 1.9 percent since 2020, notably higher than the approximate 1.4 percent annual rate in the five years before the pandemic. So that reveals our second positive shock: American workers have been more productive in recent years. This is a hugely important development because it increases the productive capacity of the economy and allows more rapid economic growth without overheating. What's more, revisions resulted in much better aligned GDP and GDI measures, and the two measures now also had much more aligned implications for productivity.</p>
<p>In summary, the surprising and largely desirable outcomes for the economy in 2024 are easier to understand once we solve the puzzles I discussed. My thorough assessment of a wide range of data sources revealed that an unusual combination of reports over the past year were gradually resolved once we understood the two positive supply shocks I discussed: growth in the labor force due to an increase in immigration, and higher productivity growth.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Outlook</strong><br />The data we have received in recent weeks have been consistent with the economic forces I described earlier. Real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The latest readings of retail sales have been strong. If household demand remains resilient, that would support growth in the fourth quarter and into next year.</p>
<p>Monthly payroll gains have eased from earlier in the year, consistent with a gradual cooling of the labor market. It was difficult to draw a clear signal from the most recent jobs report, due to significant effects from hurricanes and labor strikes. I look forward to reviewing additional labor data on Friday. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is near the level I judge as roughly consistent with our maximum-employment mandate. After rising earlier this year, the rate has stabilized, though this was partly due to some withdrawals from the labor force. That bears watching moving forward.</p>
<p>The trend in immigration slowed in the second half of this year, and there is reason to expect immigration flows could further slow. I will closely monitor this data.</p>
<p>Inflation readings released last week show that overall PCE prices rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and core PCE prices increased 2.8 percent. I still view those readings, as of now, as consistent with inflation on a path to return to our 2 percent goal, and I am encouraged that inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. But they also show the job is not yet done. Housing services inflation, in particular, remains elevated. And while global inputs to inflation have been mostly modest in recent months, it is difficult to predict future pressures.</p>
<p>I have observed that the trade policy uncertainty index has risen in recent months, likely reflecting risks of changes in trade policy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20241203a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Of course, the incoming Administration and Congress have not enacted any policies yet, so it is too early to make judgements. Studying the specifics, when they come out, will be important, as trade policy may affect productivity and prices. I will make assessments about what the net effects of any policy changes will be on prices or employment and how the balance between the two legs of our mandate will be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook for Monetary Policy</strong><br />Given how the economy has developed this year, most notably the continuation of disinflation and a modest cooling in the labor market, I see the Fed's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability as being roughly in balance. In light of the progress toward our goals, my colleagues and I on the FOMC judged it appropriate to lower our policy rate in September and again last month. These actions were steps toward removing restraint, as we are in the process of moving policy toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it is important to emphasize that policy is not on a preset course. I will make decisions meeting by meeting and carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. While I have gained more confidence that the two positive supply shocks I described have helped create the solid economic conditions that are currently in place, I will vigilantly monitor for incoming risks or negative supply shocks that may undo the progress that we have achieved in reducing inflation. I view our current policy setting as well positioned to deal with any uncertainties we face in pursuing both sides of our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Once More Unto The Breach - Speech By Philippe Lintern, Given At FX Markets Europe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">
<p>In this speech, Philippe Lintern reflects on the lessons learnt from the history of the FX market. He discusses the upcoming review of the FX Global Code and the importance for market-wide adoption of the updated Code. He also highlights the need for action to mitigate FX settlement risk.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;<br />Or close the wall up with our English dead!<br />In peace there's nothing so becomes a man,<br />As modest stillness and humility;<br />But when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br />Then imitate the action of the tiger&rsquo;</p>
<p>This speech from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry V seems apt to describe the history of the Foreign Exchange (FX) market. The FX market as we know it, was born from a crisis, namely the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in 1971 and the end of the dollar peg for many currencies. Thereafter, the FX market has prevailed over many crises, interspersed by calmer times.</p>
<p>The story of FX is one of huge success. The FX market has grown hand in hand with the global economy and has become the largest and most liquid market in the world, with over $7.5 trillion of FX turnover every day<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/december/philippe-lintern-speech-at-fx-markets-europe-on-global-fx-code#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;(see Chart 1). London remains the heart of this market, representing close to 40% of the global turnover<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/december/philippe-lintern-speech-at-fx-markets-europe-on-global-fx-code#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. The FX market underpins the global economy by enabling the international flow of goods, services, and capital. It provides the infrastructure for households, businesses, and financial market participants to transact across international markets confidently, efficiently, and at fair market prices.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of BME Scaleup has approved the incorporation of&nbsp;<span>Alquiler Seguro Asset Market SOCIMI</span>&nbsp;on 5 December, once all the documentation submitted by the company has been analysed and studied and a favourable evaluation report has been issued by the Market Coordination and Incorporations Committee.</p>

This market, which offers the necessary transparency to investors and simplifies incorporation requirements for companies, is also open to other types of companies such as SMEs, SOCIMIs or family businesses seeking a first contact with the capital markets.</p>
<p>Among the advantages of BME Scaleup for companies are its ability to boost growth with funds for financing, obtain greater prestige and brand visibility, the possibility of expanding their investor base, the boost to inorganic growth and greater ease of attracting and retaining talent.</p>
<p>To be listed on this market, a company must be a public limited company, have a board of directors, be accompanied by an adviser registered with the market and publish audited annual accounts. A liquidity provider and a minimum free float are not required.</p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Following The U.S. Election Reaches Highest Levels Since May 2021</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/purdue-universitycme-group-ag-economy-barometer-farmer-sentiment-following-the/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/purdue-universitycme-group-ag-economy-barometer-farmer-sentiment-following-the/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment jumped again in November, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=3195169144&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;climbing 30 points to a reading of 145. This marked the highest level of farmer optimism since&nbsp;May 2021, driven by considerable gains in both the Current Conditions and Future Expectations indices. The Future Expectations Index saw the largest jump, rising 37 points to 161, while the Current Conditions Index increased 18 points to 113.</p>
<p>The November sentiment boost reflects growing optimism about a more favorable regulatory and tax environment for agriculture following the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;election. This month's survey was conducted from&nbsp;Nov. 11-15, 2024.</p>
<p>In November's survey, farmers reported a notably more positive outlook for their operations and the broader agricultural economy. The percentage of producers expecting their farm's financial performance to improve over the next year climbed to 33%, up from 19% in October. Optimism about the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agricultural sector also surged, with 34% of farmers anticipating good times financially in the next 12 months, more than double October's 15%.</p>
<p>Looking ahead five years, over half of November's respondents (52%) predicted widespread prosperity for&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agriculture, a noticeable increase from 34% the previous month. This growing confidence was also reflected in farmers' investment plans, as 22% reported that it's a good time for large capital investments, compared to 15% in October.</p>
<p>Farmers' improved sentiment also carried over to their investment outlook, as the Farm Capital Investment Index rose 13 points in November to a reading of 55 &mdash; the highest level since&nbsp;May 2021. The change in investment sentiment was partly driven by expectations of stronger financial performance in 2025 compared to 2024. For the second consecutive month, the percentage of producers expecting better financial conditions in the year ahead increased, climbing to 25% in November from 16% in October. This positive shift drove the Farm Financial Performance Index up to 106, marking a 16-point increase from October and a substantial 38-point jump since September.</p>
<p>Following the improvements in the short-term and long-term farmland value indices in October's survey, both indices saw modest declines in November. The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index dropped by 5 points, while the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index decreased by 3 points. Despite these small decreases, the indices remained relatively strong, with the short-term index at 115 and the long-term index at 156.</p>
<p>To gain insight into how farmers' sentiment might align with potential policy shifts following a change in presidential administrations, barometer surveys included several policy-related questions before and after the 2020 and 2024 elections.</p>
<p>In the wake of the 2024 election, farmers' views on environmental regulations experienced a sharp reversal. In October, 41% of respondents anticipated a more restrictive regulatory environment over the next five years, while only 10% expected less restrictive regulations. However, the November survey saw a dramatic shift, with just 9% of surveyed farmers expecting stricter regulations and 55% predicting a more favorable, less restrictive regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>There was a modest shift from October to&nbsp;November 2024&nbsp;when asked about tax expectations, but a notable contrast with responses following the 2020 election. In&nbsp;November 2024, more than half (55%) of respondents expected income tax rates to remain unchanged, compared to just 25% in 2020. Similarly, 57% of respondents in the November survey anticipated estate tax rates to stay the same over the next five years, a large increase from 28% in&nbsp;November 2020.</p>
<p>"While optimism is up, farmers are also expressing concerns about the potential risks to agricultural trade, with many fearing that a trade war could significantly impact&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;exports," said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=1800396035&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4314335-1&amp;h=711896574&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of November's survey respondents indicated they believe it is "likely" or "very likely" that&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;agriculture could face a "trade war," potentially leading to a significant decline in agricultural exports.</p>
<p>"As we move into 2025, farmers' outlook for agriculture remains positive, but they are closely monitoring the evolving political landscape and its potential impact on both policy and international trade," Mintert said.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>At the latest edition of the Salone dei Pagamenti, Fabrick once again outlined integration pathways for a new world of services that aim to foster the development of new models.&nbsp; </b></li>
<li><b>With its cutting-edge vision and comprehensive platform, Fabrick is among the selected entities in the Call for Proposal by Milan Hub of the Bank of Italy.&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Embedded Finance consolidates its position as a <b>key enabler of innovation, capable of driving value across the entire supply chain</b>, benefitting businesses in all sectors as well as their end customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This crucial role and the potential Embedded Finance can unlock in various fields were discussed at the workshop titled <b><i>"Embedded Finance as a Driver of Cross-Industry Innovation"</i></b><i>,</i> organised by <a href="https://www.fabrick.com/it-it/">Fabrick</a><a href="https://www.fabrick.com/it-it/">,</a> a company operating internationally in Open Finance, at the recently concluded <b>Salone dei Pagamenti</b> in Milan. Following its previous focus on Embedded Finance as an <b>emerging trend</b>, particularly its impact on payment integration in the evolution of services and customer experience, Fabrick this year presented concrete use cases from Luca Corti, Country Manager at Mastercard, Francesco Cosciotti, CFO of Toyota Financial Services, and Paolo Zaccardi, CEO and Co-Founder of Fabrick. These use cases provided valuable insights and sparked further discussion on the topic. <b>Paolo Zaccardi, CEO and Co-founder of Fabrick,</b> said: <i>&ldquo;Embedded Finance today represents the intersection of customers&rsquo; growing demand for simple, seamless, and integrated experiences and companies&rsquo; need to innovate by streamlining internal processes. Through our Open Finance platform, we support corporates across all sectors in simplifying and optimising payment processes, enabling the easy integration of new solutions and services in a modular way. The use of artificial intelligence and predictive models also allows us to analyse data and create increasingly personalised and enriched experiences for the end customer.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Thanks to <b>Embedded Finance</b>, companies in any sector can integrate financial services into their offerings and provide payment, banking, and insurance services without the need to build proprietary financial infrastructure or obtain regulatory approvals. This simplifies complex processes both internally and externally, creating an ecosystem of value-added services around payments.</p>
<p><b>Embedded Finance</b> therefore serves as both a growth driver and a <b>catalyst for innovation</b>. <b>Fabrick</b> has supported companies across various industries, including automotive, logistics, energy, and utilities, in integrating financial services into their value chains, creating more personalised and fluid experiences while ensuring continuity across multiple channels. Customers can choose the most suitable payment method while accessing a range of additional services designed to enrich and simplify the overall experience.</p>
<p>In this context, <b>Fabrick</b> and <b>Toyota Financial Services</b> have launched a collaboration in the <b>&lsquo;FinMobility&rsquo;</b> sector, aiming to create value from all payment and information flows within mobility ecosystems. Through the "Check IBAN" solution, innovative energy operators simplify the customer onboarding process, while companies like <b>Sorgenia</b> and <b>Iren Luce Gas e Servizi</b> are using transactional data analysis tools to optimise credit scoring. The logistics sector is also seeing innovation and <b>Fabrick</b> has partnered with a leading European distributor of products and services in its sector to streamline B2B collection processes.</p>
<p>Fabrick's forward-thinking vision of this key Open Finance trend is increasingly validated by reputable figures.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Kiromic Biopharma And Two Former C-Suite Executives With Misleading Investors About Status Of FDA Reviews - SEC Declines To Impose Civil Penalties Against Company Due To Its Self-Reporting, Remediation, And Cooperation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Houston-based biotherapeutics company Kiromic BioPharma, Inc., its former CEO, Maurizio Chiriva-Internati, and its former chief financial officer, Tony Tontat, for failing to disclose material information about Kiromic&rsquo;s two cancer fighting drug candidates before, during, and after a July 2021 follow-on public offering that raised $40 million. Kiromic and Tontat have agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges in separate administrative proceedings and Chiriva has agreed to settle the charges in federal district court. Kiromic was not ordered to pay a civil penalty in light of its self-reporting, cooperation, and remediation, and Chiriva and Tontat agreed to pay civil penalties of $125,000 and $20,000, respectively, to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These resolutions strike the right balance between holding Kiromic&rsquo;s then-two most senior officers responsible for Kiromic&rsquo;s disclosure failures while also crediting Kiromic for its voluntary self-report, remediation, proactively instituting remedial measures, and providing meaningful cooperation to the staff,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Kiromic, the company raised $40 million in a public offering on July 2, 2021, for the purpose of funding the prospective clinical trials for its two cancer fighting drug candidates, the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1. However, the SEC&rsquo;s order found that two weeks before the public offering, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified Kiromic that it had placed the drug candidates on clinical hold&mdash;an FDA order to delay the proposed clinical investigations. The SEC&rsquo;s order also found that Kiromic did not disclose the FDA clinical holds in its SEC filings, investor roadshow calls, or during due diligence calls leading up to the offering, despite the fact that Kiromic disclosed the hypothetical risk of a clinical hold and the potential negative consequences on Kiromic&rsquo;s business. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Kiromic consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order, which requires Kiromic to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the antifraud, reporting, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Chiriva, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleges that Chiriva learned about the FDA clinical holds for the ALEXIS-PRO-1 and the ALEXIS-ISO-1 on June 16 and 17, 2021, respectively. The complaint alleges that Chiriva reviewed, signed, and contributed content to a report filed with the SEC on June 25, 2021, and signed and certified another report filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, both of which failed to disclose the FDA clinical holds. The complaint also alleges that three days before Kiromic&rsquo;s offering, Chiriva participated in roadshow calls with investors and did not correct misstatements by another Kiromic officer about the status of the FDA review by disclosing the FDA&rsquo;s clinical holds. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, Chiriva has agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges by consenting to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud, reporting, certification, and disclosure controls provisions of the federal securities laws, to be barred for three years from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to the civil penalty referenced above. The settlement is subject to court approval.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Tontat, after the July 2021 public offering, Tontat received and reviewed detailed letters from the FDA explaining the FDA&rsquo;s decision for issuing the June 16 and 17, 2021 clinical holds. The order also found that, despite acknowledging that the FDA communications were material and warranted disclosure, Tontat signed and certified Kiromic&rsquo;s August 13, 2021, Form 10-Q that failed to disclose the clinical holds. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Tontat consented to the SEC&rsquo;s order, which requires him to cease and desist from committing or causing future violations of the reporting and certification provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay the civil penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Kendrack Lewis of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of Samantha S. Martin and B. David Fraser. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Jennifer Reece and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Equity revenue declined globally by 6% due to a 14% drop in fees year-over-year.

<title>ASEAN Taxonomy Board (ATB) Conducts Workshop On The ASEAN Taxonomy For Sustainable Finance (ASEAN Taxonomy) In Hanoi, Vietnam And Announces Forthcoming Public Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) &amp; Use Cases In Response To Stakeholder Consultation Feedback</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asean-taxonomy-board-atb-conducts-workshop-on-the-asean-taxonomy-for-sustainab/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asean-taxonomy-board-atb-conducts-workshop-on-the-asean-taxonomy-for-sustainab/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The ATB, with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held an ASEAN Taxonomy Hybrid Socialisation Workshop in Hanoi, Viet Nam on 2-3 December 2024. Hosted by the State Securities Commission of Viet Nam, the event also incorporated a session on governance, stewardship and sustainability organised by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), which is one of the sectoral bodies that make up the ATB.</p>
<p>The event kicked-off with a panel session on &ldquo;Pathways to Developing a Sustainable Finance Taxonomy&rdquo;, featuring developers of national taxonomies that have been developed or are under development from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. This was followed by an indepth workshop on how to apply the Foundation Framework and Plus Standard of the ASEAN Taxonomy conducted by the ATB, Sustainable Finance Institute Asia and DNV. On Day 2, a panel comprising ASEAN capital market regulators and institutional investors examined the role of institutional investors in driving the sustainability agenda among corporates through stewardship codes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ATB hopes to conduct more of such workshops to enhance awareness and implementation of the ASEAN Taxonomy. Such efforts are in line with feedback and suggestions received from the targeted stakeholder consultation on the ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3 which was held from July to October 2024.</p>
<p>The ATB is encouraged by the positive responses from stakeholders, with most of the feedback received pertaining to suggestions on improving clarity in definitions and usability of the ASEAN Taxonomy Version 3, and heightening awareness and capacity building related to the implementation of the Taxonomy. Given the proliferation of taxonomies and guidances, stakeholders highlighted the need for mutual recognition and international credibility of taxonomies through interoperability and equivalence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders shared on the need for tools to help implementation of the Taxonomy. In response to this need, the ATB has taken the initiative of producing a Public FAQ document, addressing common pertinent questions relating to the ASEAN Taxonomy. It is the ATB&rsquo;s hope that this Public FAQ will assist in the understanding, socialisation, and uptake of the ASEAN Taxonomy.&nbsp; In addition to the Public FAQ, the ATB is also developing new Use Cases for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises using the Foundation Framework of the ASEAN Taxonomy, as useful points of reference to ease further adoption and utilisation of the ASEAN Taxonomy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus far, the ASEAN Taxonomy has seen several encouraging examples of utilisation, which were also verified by Second Party Opinion providers. Bangkok Expressway and Metro Plc used the ASEAN Taxonomy Transportation &amp; Storage as well as DNSH Criteria, in their issuance of sustainability finance instruments via a Sustainable Financing Framework in September 2024. The Provincial Electric Authority (PEA), a Thai State Utility Operator had also referenced the ASEAN Taxonomy Energy and DNSH Criteria in their issuance of Sustainability Bonds in August 2024.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the ATB will continue to explore more market-facing activities to encourage and facilitate the use and usability of the ASEAN Taxonomy, and by extension, further the development of the sustainable finance ecosystem in the region. <b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>CHAIR&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>ASEAN Taxonomy Board</p>
<p align="left"><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span> </i></b><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy serves as a principal reference point in ASEAN to orientate capital flows and funding towards sustainable activities and investments.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy is a collaborative initiative</i><i> that has been jointly launched by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), the ASEAN Insurance Regulators Meeting (AIRM), the ASEAN Senior Level Committee on Financial Integration (SLC), and the ASEAN Working Committee on Capital Market Development (WC-CMD). This follows previous sustainable finance initiatives by the ASEAN sectoral bodies, such as the ASEAN Green, Social and Sustainability Bond Standards and the ASEAN Sustainable Banking Principles.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><i>The ASEAN Taxonomy represents the collective commitment of ASEAN Member States (AMS) in transitioning towards a sustainable region. The ASEAN Taxonomy will be the overarching guide for all AMS, complementing their respective national sustainability initiatives and serving as ASEAN&rsquo;s common language for sustainable finance. It is a multi-tiered taxonomy that will take into account ASEAN&rsquo;s needs, as well as international aspirations and goals. We believe that such a multi-tiered ASEAN Taxonomy is inclusive and will be beneficial to all AMS, and facilitate an orderly and effective transition towards a sustainable ASEAN. </i></p>
<p><i>The ATB was set up in 2021 under the auspices of the ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors&rsquo; Meeting (AFMGM) and is jointly driven by the ACMF, AIRM, SLC and the WC-CMD. Its establishment is a response to the call at the 6th AFMGM to work towards: </i></p>
<p align="left"><i>&ldquo;&hellip;.furthering a cohesive sustainable finance agenda cutting across banking, capital markets and insurance areas at the ASEAN Finance Ministers&rsquo; Meeting and AFMGM respectively, with greater coordination amongst the relevant ASEAN working committees.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>The importance of a common taxonomy for ASEAN was identified in the ACMF&rsquo;s Roadmap for ASEAN </i></p>
<p><i>Sustainable Capital Markets, the SLC&rsquo;s Report on The Roles of ASEAN Central Banks in Managing Climate and Environment-related Risks and the WC-CMD&rsquo;s Report on Promoting Sustainable Finance in ASEAN. </i></p>
<p><i>The current Board comprises representatives from all 10 ASEAN Member States, as follows: </i></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Brunei Darussalam Central Bank (Chair) </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Vice-Chair) </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Monetary Authority of Singapore&nbsp; </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Non-Bank Financial Services Authority of Cambodia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Financial Services Authority of Indonesia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank of the Lao PDR </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank Negara Malaysia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Securities Commission Malaysia </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Ministry of Planning and Finance of Myanmar </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Securities and Exchange Commission Philippines </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Bank of Thailand </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand&nbsp; </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>State Securities Commission of Viet Nam </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Insurance Regulator of Cambodia </i></b></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Sustainable Finance Institute Asia (SFIA) provides support as host of the ATB.&nbsp;</i></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span><span><span>Every LEI links to a verified company identity record held in the Global LEI Index, an open, globally recognized data bank that is free for all to access. Each LEI record contains key reference information registered by local authoritative sources to enable the clear and unique identification of legal entities globally. The new 'linking' initiative adds a dedicated URL to the LEI records of entities registered by KVK, providing direct access to the official registry data and associated information products on the KVK website.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The initiative stands to significantly streamline Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Supplier (KYS) checks and other due diligence obligations, as&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="_Hlk183770869">an organization's registry data on the KVK website is now immediately available to any counterparty across the world via the Global LEI Index.</a>&nbsp;This removes the requirement for global data users to initially confirm KVK as the relevant registration authority, identify and navigate to the correct website, translate into local language, and then manually search for an organization using its business registration number.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" name="_Hlk183771079">Local businesses in the Netherlands subsequently stand to benefit from increased discoverability and identifiability globally. This is particularly beneficial for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) looking to expand into new markets.</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO, GLEIF, comments: "Business registries play a crucial role in promoting transparency across the global economy but finding and effectively corroborating information about local organizations&mdash;particularly SMEs&mdash;can prove challenging. By simplifying access to authoritative information about businesses in the Netherlands, our collaboration with KVK is promoting increased trust and transparency across the broader economy. This marks an important step forward and reflects wider opportunities for business registries across the world to leverage the LEI as a central data connector."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cindy Lourens, Director of Registers, KVK, comments: "This new initiative is a simple, elegant solution that promises to help global data users more effectively connect the dots. Any business registered in the Netherlands can now use their LEI as a 'global passport' to help facilitate cross-border payments, transactions and trade, with the confidence that their organization is instantly discoverable, and that key reference information is immediately available to any counterparty across the world."</span></span></span></p>

<title>TP ICAP And AWS Announce Major Strategic Collaboration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><b><i>Amazon Web Services to collaborate with TP ICAP to accelerate development of Fusion, TP ICAP&rsquo;s market-leading electronic platform.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>TP ICAP and Amazon Web Services to co-develop sustainability trading solutions.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Amazon Web Services to apply its expertise to establish TP ICAP AI and Innovation Lab.</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>TP ICAP Group (LON: TCAP) (TP ICAP), a world-leading provider of financial markets infrastructure and data solutions, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced a major agreement to streamline and scale TP ICAP&rsquo;s technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>A key focus of this multifaceted agreement is to accelerate the development of Fusion, TP ICAP&rsquo;s flagship digital platform.&nbsp;Fusion, a cloud-based platform, is designed to enhance TP ICAP&rsquo;s ability to serve clients throughout the transaction lifecycle.</p>
<p>The collaboration with AWS will involve 45 highly skilled AWS Professional Services engineers working alongside TP ICAP&rsquo;s technology teams to co-develop the Fusion platform. Utilising data analytics and generative AI to enhance developers&rsquo; productivity, this agreement aims to more than halve new product development times, enhance scalability, and nearly double TP ICAP&rsquo;s IT workload on AWS Cloud to more than 80%.</p>
<p>Additionally, AWS will work with TP ICAP to reinforce its leadership in energy and commodities brokerage. Focusing on the energy transition, TP ICAP and AWS will explore opportunities to co-develop innovative, sustainability-focused trading solutions, and support Amazon&rsquo;s suppliers in creating decarbonisation plans, aligning with Amazon&rsquo;s net-zero carbon ambition by 2040.</p>
<p>AWS will also help TP ICAP establish an AI and Innovation Lab to accelerate and scale AI-driven solutions. This lab will build on TP ICAP&rsquo;s successful projects to date, like automating regulatory governance reviews with Amazon Bedrock and creating a Chatbot to automate client engagement analysis and generate actionable insights.</p>
<p><b>Nicolas Breteau, Group CEO, TP ICAP,</b>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;This strategic collaboration with AWS positions TP ICAP as a leader in digital transformation within our industry. We will be able to develop new functionality, faster, to enhance our electronic platform, Fusion. And by equipping our teams with AI expertise and tools, we will further strengthen our ability to develop new solutions, execute at scale, and better serve our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tanuja Randery, VP &amp; Managing Director AWS EMEA</b>, said: &ldquo;We are excited to embark on this transformative journey with TP ICAP.&nbsp;TP ICAP&rsquo;s &ldquo;All in on Cloud&rdquo; strategy aims to migrate&nbsp;over 80% of its technology infrastructure to AWS by the end of 2026. This will reduce TP ICAP&rsquo;s reliance on physical data centres and legacy systems, delivering millions in annual savings and cutting carbon emissions. And with the establishment of its AI and Innovation Lab, TP ICAP is also investing in training, equipping its workforce with capabilities and skills in developing advanced AI-driven solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Scott Mullins, Managing Director, Financial Services at AWS</b>, said: "Leveraging AWS generative AI capabilities like Amazon Bedrock, TP ICAP will be able to rapidly deliver innovative services, gain predictive insights, increase productivity, and better respond to customer needs. This collaboration underscores AWS's leadership in wholesale markets and our ability to deliver secure, compliant, and AI-enabled solutions that drive tangible business value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new seven-year strategic collaboration agreement builds on the proven decade-long working relationship between TP ICAP and AWS.</p>

<p><span>The collaboration between Kaizen and RegGenome will support the digitisation of regulation where both parties will work together to provide fast and efficient access to a vast array of global regulatory rules, jurisdictions and taxonomies on the Single Rulebook platform. By combining Single Rulebook&rsquo;s front end user interface with RegGenome&rsquo;s AI powered regulatory data and information structures, the firms will provide clients with a new standard of regulatory intelligence and change management.</span></p>
<p><span>Many financial institutions operate across multiple locations and global regulatory jurisdictions. Today&rsquo;s announcement means that firms will be able to navigate and respond quickly to the complex landscape of regulatory change and divergence more easily and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>In early 2025, Single Rulebook clients will be able to access regulatory content covering all major global financial markets. This includes coverage of US federal regulators and agencies, European national law and global G20 members.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to core financial services regulations, Single Rulebook users will also be able to investigate emerging compliance requirements for cryptocurrency, cyber security and digital operational resilience.</span></p>
<p><span>Mark Johnston, CEO, RegGenome commented: &ldquo;We are delighted to announce our strategic partnership with Kaizen's Single Rulebook. This collaboration will make RegGenome's comprehensive structured regulatory data available through Single Rulebook's innovative platform.

<p><span>Chris Dingley, CEO, Single Rulebook said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to announce our partnership with RegGenome today. Working with RegGenome&rsquo;s AI solution for regulatory data and information means that we will be able to expand the Single Rulebook platform and content rapidly for our clients, continuing and enhancing our efforts to support them with the burden of managing global regulation.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>RegGenome processes global regulation using artificial intelligence (AI) to transform what is human-readable into machine-readable and machine-consumable data.&nbsp;It is part of the Regulatory Genome Project (RGP), a public-private initiative between the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, and RegGenome. RGP aims to build and review a set of open-access regulatory information structures, known as the Cambridge Regulatory Genome (CRG), and make available a global repository of aggregated, structured regulatory data. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Single Rulebook is Kaizen&rsquo;s digital solution for searching and navigating global regulation. The platform helps firms manage regulatory change with front end functionality such as rule maps, labels and annotations which can be pinned to regulatory rules and shared across global organisations.</span></p>

<title>ASIC Flags Key Observations From Inaugural IDR Data Publication</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-key-observations-from-inaugural-idr-data-publication/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released its first publication of industry-wide data reported under the internal dispute resolution (IDR) data reporting framework.</p>
<p>Under the IDR framework, most licensed financial firms are required to report IDR data to ASIC on a six-monthly basis. This inaugural industry-wide report is a key milestone in the implementation of the framework. Publishing IDR data promotes transparency by sharing valuable information with consumers while also helping to drive improvements in IDR practices.</p>
<p>Key observations from the over 4.7 million complaints reported by financial firms of all types for the period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>General insurance products were subject to the most complaints (33% of all complaints), followed by credit products (22%) and deposit-taking products (15%)</li>
<li>most complaints were about service (45%), followed by charges (22%) and transactions (11%)</li>
<li>most outcomes involved an explanation or apology only, or no remedy (43%), followed by a service-based remedy (39%) and a monetary remedy (13%)</li>
<li>over three-quarters of all complaints were resolved within one day, and</li>
<li>623,555 complaints resulted in a monetary remedy, collectively totalling over $375 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>While ASIC does not verify that financial firms&rsquo; self-reported data accurately reflects their underlying complaints handling, we found variations in the volume of complaints reported by comparable firms and gaps in the IDR data that indicate the data reported to ASIC may not fully reflect the complaints received by some firms. As a result, ASIC is concerned that some firms are not reporting IDR data as accurately as is possible.</p>
<p>Moreover, 5,035 firms declared no complaints to report for the full year period. This number is higher than ASIC expected.</p>
<p>ASIC will assess compliance with the reporting requirements by reviewing firms that make a nil submission against other datasets, including reports of misconduct, reportable situations and data from the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said it is important for firms to foster a positive complaints management culture, including a focus on gathering accurate data, adding that firms should reflect on the detailed requirements and practical guidance outlined in ASIC&rsquo;s IDR data reporting handbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gaps we&rsquo;ve identified suggest there may be inconsistent IDR reporting practices across the industry,&rdquo; said Commissioner Kirkland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While there may be reasonable explanations for some of these variances, we encourage firms to carefully review our report and guidance to assist in reporting complete and accurate IDR data. Starting from next year, we&rsquo;ll be publishing data about complaints received by individual firms. It is crucial that firms act now to address any gaps in IDR reporting processes, because we will publish the data as it is reported to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said ASIC is closely examining the standard of IDR reporting and undertaking a range of activities to strengthen compliance with the regime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where we become aware of problems, we will engage with firms to understand the causes, and whether they stem from deficiencies in the firm&rsquo;s underlying IDR processes or in IDR data reporting,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ongoing analysis of the IDR data will also inform our other regulatory activities, so industry can expect to hear more from ASIC on this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead of publishing firm-level data, ASIC will consult on our approach to contextualising and presenting the data.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As the first step in the financial dispute resolution framework, IDR plays a vital role in providing remedies and protections for consumers. ASIC is responsible for overseeing the effective operation of the dispute resolution system, which includes setting the standards and requirements for financial firms&rsquo; IDR processes.</p>
<p>Since 5 October 2021 financial firms have been required to record all complaints received through their IDR processes. All financial firms began reporting this IDR data to ASIC for the first time from 1 January 2024.</p>
<p>The IDR data reporting framework is the culmination of many years of work with industry to record, improve and standardise the quality of dispute resolution data. In 2025, ASIC will publish firm-level IDR data. This will enable the public to compare the IDR data reported by individual firms.</p>
<p>Collecting, and ultimately publishing, internal dispute resolution data provides greater public visibility of where consumers may be having difficulties. It provides ASIC with an important data set to assist with regulatory decision making and will drive firms to improve IDR practices. The obligation on financial firms to submit IDR data to ASIC is ongoing every six months. ASIC will continue to engage with firms on meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>Financial firms can get more information on the requirements from ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting/" title="Internal dispute resolution data reporting">IDR data reporting page</a>, which includes frequently asked questions.</p>

<title>Cut Or Skip? Federal Reseve Governor Christopher J. Waller At "Building A Better Fed Framework," American Institute For Economic Research Monetary Conference, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Lydia, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I thought I might use my time with you to address the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) ongoing effort to return inflation to our 2 percent target while keeping the labor market and the economy strong.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241202a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>After significant progress in reducing inflation and evident moderation in the labor market, in September the Committee judged that the time had come to begin easing monetary policy toward a more neutral setting to limit the risk of unduly weakening the labor market as progress continues toward 2 percent inflation. After reducing the policy rate 75 basis points since our September meeting, I believe that monetary policy is still restrictive and putting downward pressure on inflation without creating undesirable weakness in the labor market. I expect rate cuts to continue over the next year until we approach a more neutral setting of the policy rate.</p>
<p>But recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be stalling at a level meaningfully above 2 percent. This risk has raised concerns that the FOMC should consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to collect more information about the future path of inflation and the economy. Based on the economic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its downward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting. But that decision will depend on whether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my forecast for the path of inflation.</p>
<p>Let me turn to the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a strong annual pace of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and indications are that growth in the fourth quarter will be a bit slower. An average of private sectors forecasts predicts 2.2 percent, while based on fairly limited data so far, the Atlanta Fed&rsquo;s GDPNow model currently predicts 3.2 percent.</p>
<p>On the consumer side of the economy, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.1 percent in October after a 0.5 percent rise in September. Given the recent volatility in these numbers, I won't read too much into the monthly swing. The modest increase in October might partially reflect some payback to the stronger growth in September. Overall, household balance sheets continue to be in generally good shape, and this position should help maintain spending going forward.</p>
<p>On the business side of the economy, the S&amp;P Global U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose slightly in November but still stands at a level indicating a slight deterioration in overall business conditions among manufacturers for the fifth straight month. Today's Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey had a similar leaning. These readings are consistent with industrial production data for manufacturing remaining flat, as it has been for the past several months.</p>
<p>But these aggregate data mask quite different performances for interest-sensitive sectors and other businesses not so affected by rates. In the spring of 2022, when the FOMC began raising interest rates, production by more interest rate&ndash;sensitive manufacturers, such as business equipment, grew at about the same rate as production by less rate-sensitive manufacturers. But starting around the middle of 2023, when the policy rate hit its peak, those stories diverged, and production by interest-sensitive manufacturing declined, while other manufacturing rose, driving a sizable gap between the two types of industries. This divergence is an indication to me that, even after the Committee cut rates 75 basis points, restrictive policy is working the way it is intended to, affecting production in sectors where rates matter. It is also a reminder that there is still some distance to go in reducing the policy rate to neutral. As that occurs, I expect the gap between the two types of industries will narrow. As for the service sector, which is the larger share of business activity, the November S&amp;P Global U.S. PMI continued to increase, extending the strong momentum for services over the past year or two.</p>
<p>While the picture for economic activity is pretty clear right now across the major data that we look at, things aren't as clear in recent data on the labor market. As expected, the October employment report showed very little increase in the number of jobs, but likely because of the temporary effects of the recent hurricanes and the strike at Boeing, which also affected businesses serving Boeing and its workers. The strike is over, and it is likely that most of the job losses from the hurricane have reversed. So I do expect a rebound in payroll data in the November employment report that is due out later this week, but it may take more time for the full swings in the payroll data to fully wash out.</p>
<p>For that reason, I am leaning on other metrics to reveal what is really going on in the labor market. And when I look at a broader range of data, it tells a fairly consistent story over the past year about moderating demand relative to supply, consistent with continued progress toward 2 percent inflation and without an undesirable weakening in the labor market.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate started 2024 at 3.7 percent and climbed gradually, briefly hitting 4.3 percent before falling back down to 4.1 percent in September and October. While that is still quite low in historical terms, it indicates a labor market significantly looser than we saw from the middle of 2022 to the middle of 2023, when unemployment was close to 3.5 percent and fast wage growth contributed to high inflation. Other data sharpen this image of a looser but still-strong labor market. The share of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs, an indication of tightness in the labor market, has trended down to levels lower than before the pandemic. The number of job openings continues to gradually fall, another sign of moderating demand relative to supply, but the number of layoffs is still low, consistent with a healthy labor market.</p>
<p>Growth in wages and other forms of compensation has moderated at the same time that labor productivity has grown strongly. This story is very different than a couple of years ago when, for example, average hourly wages grew at an annual rate above 5 percent in 2022, at the same time that the productivity of workers was declining. This double whammy put significant upward pressure on inflation. But over the second and third quarters of 2024, average hourly wages have grown at less than a 4 percent annual rate, while productivity has grown around 2 percent. The math is pretty simple&mdash;4 percent wage growth minus the 2 percent gain from higher productivity tells you that wage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20241202a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>While I am pleased at how well the labor market has held up under restrictive monetary policy, I am less pleased about what the data have been telling us the past couple of months about inflation. After making a lot of progress over the past year and a half, the recent data indicate that progress may be stalling. Inflation based on the Commerce Department's measure of prices for PCE rose more than expected in September and October and so did "core" PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices and is a better guide to future inflation. Three-month annualized core PCE inflation has risen over the past two months, while six-month annualized inflation has made only a small improvement. These rates now stand at 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. These recent readings have contributed to 12-month core PCE inflation of 2.8 percent in October.</p>
<p>If we compare components of core inflation this October with last October, we see 12-month housing services inflation has softened and goods inflation has moved to slight deflation, but there has been an increase in nonmarket core services excluding housing. Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold, waiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute. But let me assure you that submission is inevitable&mdash;inflation isn't getting out of the octagon.</p>
<p>While the recent increase and the level of inflation raise concerns that it may be getting stuck above the FOMC's 2 percent goal, let me emphasize that this is a risk but not a certainty. I take the recent inflation data seriously, but we saw a similar uptick in inflation a year ago that was followed by a continued decline, so I also don't want to overreact. And I expect housing services inflation to continue to moderate and I do not take much signal from the elevated inflation for other non-market services.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to the implications for monetary policy based on my assessment of the underlying economic outlook. While some near-term aspects of the outlook may be a little unclear, something that is clear is the direction for monetary policy and our policy rate over the medium term, which is down. This downward trajectory reflects the fact that the level of aggregate demand in the economy, relative to supply, has moderated significantly over the past year&mdash;it is plainly visible in the data on spending and the labor market. Inflation over that time is also significantly lower, so it makes sense to be moving policy rates toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>And there is a ways to go. In September, the median of the projections of FOMC participants was that the federal funds rate would be 3.4 percent at the end of next year, which is about 100 basis points lower than it is today. That number can and probably will change over time, but whatever the destination, there will be a variety of ways to get there, with the speed and timing of cuts determined by economic conditions we encounter on the way.</p>
<p>The motivation for continuing to cut the policy rate at the FOMC's next meeting begins with how restrictive the current setting is. After we cut by 75 basis points, I believe the evidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that cutting again will only mean that we aren't pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard. Although monthly core inflation has flattened out in recent months, there is no indication that the pace of price increases for key service categories such as housing and nonmarket services should remain at their current levels or increase. Another factor that supports a further rate cut is that the labor market appears to finally be in balance, and we should aim to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Conversely, based on what we know today, one could argue that there is a case for skipping a rate cut at the next meeting. Monthly readings on inflation have moved up noticeably recently, and we don't know whether this uptick in inflation will persist, or reverse, as we saw a year ago. Due to strikes and hurricanes, recent labor market data are giving us a cloudy view of the true state of the labor market that won't be clearer for a couple of months. As a result, one could advocate for not changing the policy rate at our upcoming meeting and adjusting our policy stance in a measured way going forward. In fact, if policymakers' estimates of the target range at the end of next year are close to correct, then the Committee will most likely be skipping rate cuts multiple times on the way to that destination.</p>
<p>In deciding which of these two approaches to take at the FOMC's next meeting, I will be watching additional data very closely. Tomorrow, we get the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. On Friday, we get the employment report, which, as I noted, may have misleading payroll data. Then next week, we get consumer and producer price indexes for November, which will allow a good estimate of PCE inflation for the month. Finally, on the first day of the FOMC meeting, we receive retail sales data for November that will give us an idea of how consumer spending is holding up.</p>
<p>All of that information will help me decide whether to cut or skip. As of today, I am leaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a more neutral setting. Policy is still restrictive enough that an additional cut at our next meeting will not dramatically change the stance of monetary policy and allow ample scope to later slow the pace of rate cuts, if needed, to maintain progress toward our inflation target. That said, if the data we receive between today and the next meeting surprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but still-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate constant. I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to help me make my decision as to what path to take.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. A similar story holds true if one looks at growth in labor productivity and hourly compensation from the Productivity and Cost release. Here the wedge between the two series has narrowed over this time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> Annual African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA or the Association) Conference was hosted by Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE) from November 27<sup>th</sup> -29th, 2024 at the Royal Area Conference</p>
<p>Center in Gaborone Botswana. The theme of this year&rsquo;s Conference was <b>Fostering Transformation in Capital Markets Through Innovation</b>; a timely topic that sought to reemphasis the importance innovation in deepening and reshaping the capital market landscape on the continent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 27<sup>th</sup> edition of the ASEA Conference attracted more than 250 delegates from Africa, Middle East, the United States of America and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While making his opening remarks, the President of the Association, Mr. Pierre Celestin Rwabukumba urged the players in the African financial markets to make a deliberate effort to highlight tremendous potential there is in harnessing new ideas, digital technologies, and creative solutions to elevate African exchanges. &ldquo;<i>Over the next few days, we will address key areas for growth&mdash;from enhancing regulatory environments to advancing sustainable finance and integrating new technologies&mdash;to drive the transformative change that Africa&rsquo;s markets require&rdquo;</i>; he noted.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the Conference was officiated by the Vice President of the Republic of Botswana &amp; Minister of Finance, Hon. Ndaba Gaolatlhe, who commended the efforts of ASEA in in forging with its democratization agenda with more inclusiveness and reemphasized on the importance of leadership in shaping a prosperous future for Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in attendance was Mrs. Emily Mburu-Ndoria, whose keynote address on trade and digitalization aligned seamlessly with our strategic objectives.&nbsp; She also insisted on the private sector being a major component for economic development of the continent under Agenda 2063 and more so the capital markets. Therefore, the private sector was called upon to assume its role as engine of growth and development in the fight against poverty; she noted.</p>
<p>Ms. Neo Mooki, the Chairperson of the BSE pointed out that some key determinants in strengthening the African financial markets would include promotion of financial literacy and entrenching the belief that the success of the continent is indeed achievable and feasible. &ldquo;Let us focus on critical issues such as transparency, efficiency and attracting investments to Africa, breaking technologies shaping our future beyond conference halls&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conference was preceded by a two-day Capacity building Seminar on the African Exchanges Linkage Project, the &ldquo;AELP&rdquo;, a landmark initiative designed to promote cross-border trading of securities across Africa. The AELP represents an ambitious step forward in linking African capital markets, enhancing liquidity, and enabling investors to access opportunities across borders with greater ease.&nbsp;</p>
